 Recognizing the Boy Scouts of America on the 100th anniversary of the 
 organization being granted a Federal charter and for the long history 
         of heritage and service of the Boy Scouts of America.

Whereas the Boy Scouts of America was founded on February 8, 1910, in 
        Washington, D.C. by Chicago publisher William D. Boyce after the 
        ``unknown scout'' aided a lost Mr. Boyce through a dense London fog and 
        refused a tip for the assistance;
Whereas the birth of the Boy Scouts of America was based on the principles of 
        the Scout Movement founded by famed British retired General Lord Robert 
        Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell;
Whereas the Federal charter of the Boy Scouts of America was passed by the House 
        of Representatives and the Senate, and was signed into law by President 
        Woodrow Wilson, the Honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America, on 
        June 15, 1916;
Whereas, with the enactment of the Federal charter, the Boy Scouts of America 
        became the preeminent Scout organization for boys and was granted 
        exclusive use of the name, ``Boy Scouts of America'';
Whereas the Boy Scouts of America, with a Federal charter, joins other 
        distinguished organizations with a similar charter for service to the 
        community, including the American Red Cross, the Girl Scouts of the 
        United States of America, and the American Legion;
Whereas the Boy Scouts of America continues to prepare young people to make 
        ethical and moral choices by teaching them the values of the Scout Oath 
        and Scout Law;
Whereas the Boy Scouts of America continues to pursue the mission of 
        ``patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values'' and the goal 
        of providing ``citizenship, service and leadership'';
Whereas both youth and adult members strive to fulfill the Scout Motto of ``Be 
        Prepared'' and the Scout Slogan of ``Do a Good Turn Daily'';
Whereas more than 2,400,000 youth and 1,000,000 adult volunteers are active 
        members of the Boy Scouts of America, and more than 110,000,000 people 
        in the United States have participated as members since 1910;
Whereas the Cub Scouts is a family-oriented program of the Boy Scouts of America 
        that has been designed specifically to address the needs of younger boys 
        since its origin in 1930;
Whereas youth and adult members of the Cub Scouts strive to fulfill the Cub 
        Scout Motto of ``Do Your Best'';
Whereas the Venturing Program, the co-ed portion of the Boy Scouts of America, 
        and the Exploring Program, the career initiative-based portion of the 
        organization, continue to serve older youth;
Whereas special programs, including Scoutreach, the `History Of Scouting Trail', 
        and the national High Adventure Bases, continue to bring Scouting to 
        inner-city youth, educate people about the important history and 
        heritage of the Scout Program, and provide outdoor challenges and 
        experiences for members of the Boy Scouts of America; and
Whereas Boy Scouts and Eagle Scouts of the Boy Scouts of America organization 
        provide more than 28,000,000 hours of community service every year 
        throughout cities and neighborhoods in the United States, including its 
        territories: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes more than 100 years of service and 
        leadership development by the Boy Scouts of America;

        values of the Scout Oath and the Scout Law in young people of 
        the United States; and
            (4) congratulates the Boy Scouts of America on the 100th 
        anniversary of the granting of a Federal charter on June 15, 
        1916.
