                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating March 25, 2016, as ``National Cerebral Palsy Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and 
        posture that are attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occur in 
        the developing brain is referred to as ``cerebral palsy'';
Whereas cerebral palsy, the most common motor disability in children, is caused 
        by damage to 1 or more specific areas of the developing brain, which 
        usually occurs during fetal development before, during, or after birth;
Whereas the majority of children who have cerebral palsy are born with cerebral 
        palsy, but cerebral palsy may be undetected for months or years;
Whereas 75 percent of individuals with cerebral palsy also have 1 or more 
        developmental disabilities, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, 
        autism, visual impairment, or blindness;
Whereas according to information released by the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention--

    (1) the prevalence of cerebral palsy is not decreasing; and

    (2) an estimated 1 in 323 children has cerebral palsy;

Whereas approximately 800,000 individuals in the United States are affected by 
        cerebral palsy;
Whereas although there is no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment often improves 
        the capabilities of a child with cerebral palsy;
Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful for breakthroughs in cerebral 
        palsy research;
Whereas researchers across the United States conduct important research projects 
        involving cerebral palsy; and
Whereas the Senate can raise awareness of cerebral palsy in the public and the 
        medical community: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 25, 2016, as ``National Cerebral Palsy 
        Awareness Day'';
            (2) encourages each individual in the United States to 
        become better informed about and aware of cerebral palsy; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Executive Director of 
        Reaching for the Stars: A Foundation of Hope for Children with 
        Cerebral Palsy.
