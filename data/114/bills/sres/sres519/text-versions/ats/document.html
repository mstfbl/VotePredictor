 Recognizing the 300th anniversary and historical significance of the 
                     city of Natchez, Mississippi.

Whereas American Indians made use of the land that is now Natchez, Mississippi 
        (in this preamble referred to as ``Natchez'') before the first European 
        explorers reached the area;
Whereas the bluff in Natchez overlooking the Mississippi River has served as a 
        natural geological setting that encouraged trade and cultural 
        development;
Whereas Natchez was founded as Fort Rosalie by French settlers under Jean-
        Baptiste Le Moyne De Bienville in 1716;
Whereas construction of Fort Rosalie was completed on August 3, 1716;
Whereas Fort Rosalie was destroyed due to conflict between Natchez Indians and 
        French soldiers and colonists in 1729 and rebuilt by the French in 1731;
Whereas Natchez came under British control in 1763 and under Spanish control in 
        1779;
Whereas the Treaty of San Lorenzo established Natchez as a United States 
        territory in 1798;
Whereas Natchez served as the original capital of the Mississippi Territory from 
        1798 to 1802 and as the original capital of the State of Mississippi 
        from 1817 to 1821;
Whereas Natchez is the terminus of the historically significant Old Natchez 
        Trace, which is now preserved by the United States National Park Service 
        and known as the Natchez Trace Parkway;
Whereas Natchez was the original home to Jackson State University, which was 
        first known as Natchez Seminary;
Whereas Natchez has been home to several notable individuals, including United 
        States Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels, United States Representative John R. 
        Lynch, and author Richard Wright;
Whereas Natchez city events contribute to the cultural life and historical 
        understanding of Mississippi, including--

    (1) the Natchez Literary and Cinema Celebration;

    (2) the Natchez Festival of Music;

    (3) the Great Mississippi River Balloon Race; and

    (4) the Natchez Pilgrimage;

Whereas the city of Natchez is currently holding a year-long tricentennial 
        celebration, in honor of the history of Natchez, that will end with a 
        300th birthday party on August 3, 2016;
Whereas the heritage and educational events during the tricentennial celebration 
        will be observed by delegations from France and Canada;
Whereas Natchez is signified nationally as the oldest European-built city on the 
        lower Mississippi River; and
Whereas it is important for the people of Mississippi and the United States to 
        remember history in an inclusive way that honors contributions from all 
        backgrounds: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the year 2016 as the ``Natchez 
        Tricentennial''; and
            (2) honors the history and founding of Mississippi through 
        the Natchez Tricentennial.
