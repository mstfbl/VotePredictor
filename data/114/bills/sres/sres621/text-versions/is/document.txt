                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating November 2016 as National Hospice and Palliative Care 
                                 Month.

Whereas hospice and palliative care services empower individuals to live as 
        fully as possible, surrounded and supported by family and loved ones, 
        despite serious and life-limiting illnesses;
Whereas hospice and palliative care can bring patients and family caregivers 
        high-quality care delivered by an interdisciplinary team of skilled 
        professionals that includes physicians, nurses, social workers, 
        therapists, counselors, health aides, spiritual care providers, and 
        others who make the wishes of each patient and family a priority;
Whereas advance care planning involves an individual making decisions about the 
        health care the individual would want to receive if faced with a serious 
        or life-limiting illness or unable to speak on behalf of the individual;
Whereas hospice and palliative care focus on quality of life through pain 
        management and symptom control, caregiver training and assistance, and 
        emotional and spiritual support, allowing patients to live fully until 
        the end of life, surrounded and supported by loved ones, friends, and 
        committed caregivers;
Whereas every year more than 1,650,000 individuals in the United States living 
        with life-limiting illness, and the families of the individuals, receive 
        care and support from hospice programs in communities throughout the 
        United States;
Whereas more than 430,000 trained volunteers contribute 19,000,000 hours of 
        service to hospice programs annually; and
Whereas hospice and palliative care providers encourage all individuals to learn 
        more about the options of the individuals for care and to share the 
        wishes of the individuals with family, loved ones, and health care 
        professionals: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates November 2016 as National Hospice and 
        Palliative Care Month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States--
                    (A) to increase their understanding and awareness 
                of care at the end of life; and
                    (B) to observe National Hospice and Palliative Care 
                Month with appropriate activities and programs.
                                 <all>
