                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 6, 2016

Mr. Lankford submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                   the Committee on Foreign Relations

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate on the actions, including the 
  reapplication of waived nuclear-related sanctions, that the United 
  States should undertake in the event of an Iranian violation of the 
                  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Whereas national security is a fundamental and primary responsibility of both 
        Congress and the President;
Whereas, on July 14, 2015, President Barack Obama reached an agreement with Iran 
        known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a political agreement 
        among the United States, France, the Russian Federation, the People's 
        Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany (commonly referred to 
        as the ``P5+1 countries'') and Iran that does not carry the force or 
        effect of United States law;
Whereas President Obama lifted nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the United 
        States with respect to Iran on January 16, 2016;
Whereas, on July 14, 2015, President Obama stated, ``If Iran violates the deal, 
        all of these sanctions will snap back into place.'';
Whereas Congress intends to work with the President to ensure that the 
        President's commitment to snapping back sanctions in response to any 
        violation by Iran of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is fully 
        enforced;
Whereas Iran has been the beneficiary of financial assets and international 
        engagement while its commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the 
        Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action has yet to be proven; and
Whereas, given the historic and dramatic shift in longstanding United States 
        foreign policy represented by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, 
        the obligations and commitments Iran agreed to as part of the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action must be clarified by the Senate: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IRANIAN VIOLATIONS OF THE JOINT 
              COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate--
            (1) that the United States should take the actions 
        specified in subsection (b) if--
                    (A) Iran ever seeks, develops, manufactures, or 
                acquires nuclear weapons;
                    (B) Iran ever engages in plutonium reprocessing or 
                plutonium-related research and development;
                    (C) Iran violates--
                            (i) the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
                        Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, 
                        and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 UST 483) (commonly 
                        referred to as the ``Nuclear Nonproliferation 
                        Treaty'' or the ``NPT'');
                            (ii) the Agreement between Iran and the 
                        International Atomic Energy Agency for the 
                        Application of Safeguards in Connection with 
                        the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
                        Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, 1973 (commonly 
                        referred to as the ``Comprehensive Safeguards 
                        Agreement'');
                            (iii) its commitment to ratify by October 
                        18, 2023, the Additional Protocol to the 
                        Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement; or
                            (iv) the Iranian-ratified Additional 
                        Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards 
                        Agreement and modified Code 3.1 of the

                uranium or plutonium;
                    (G) Iran pursues construction at the existing

                original design;
                    (H) Iran produces or tests natural uranium pellets, 
                fuel pins, or fuel assemblies that are specifically 
                designed for the support of the originally designed 
                Arak heavy water reactor, designated by the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency as IR-40;
                    (I) Iran does not store all existing natural 
                uranium pellets and IR-40 fuel assemblies under the 
                continuous monitoring of the International Atomic 
                Energy Agency until the modernized Arak reactor becomes 
                operable;
                    (J) once the Arak reactor becomes operable, Iran 
                does not take the IR-40 fuel assemblies and natural 
                uranium pellets and convert them to uranyl nitrate or 
                exchange them with an equivalent quantity of natural 
                uranium;
                    (K) Iran does not make the necessary technical 
                modifications to the natural uranium fuel production 
                process line that was intended to supply fuel for the 
                IR-40 reactor design, such that it can be used for the 
                fabrication of the fuel reloads for the modernized Arak 
                reactor;
                    (L) all spent fuel from the redesigned Arak 
                reactor, regardless of its origin, for the lifetime of 
                the reactor, is not shipped out of Iran;
                    (M) Iran operates the Fuel Manufacturing Plant to 
                produce anything other than fuel assemblies for light

                reactor;
                    (N) Iran does not inform the International Atomic 
                Energy Agency about the inventory and production of the 
                Heavy Water Production Plant or does not allow the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the 
                quantities of the heavy water stocks and the amount of 
                heavy water produced, including through visits by the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency, as requested, to 
                the Heavy Water Production Plant;

                Atomic Energy Agency, including issuing long-term 
                visas, as well as providing proper working space at 
                nuclear sites and, to the best of its effort, at 
                locations near nuclear sites in Iran for the designated 
                International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors for 
                working and keeping necessary equipment;
                    (Z) Iran does not increase the number of designated

                least 130 by October 16, 2016, which is the date that 
                is 9 months after implementation day, or does not allow 
                the designation of inspectors from countries that have 
                diplomatic relations with Iran;
                    (AA) Iran does not apply nuclear export policies

                        cascades through the use of welded pipework on 
                        withdrawal main headers in a manner that 
                        precludes the withdrawal of enriched and 
                        depleted uranium materials and verified by the 
                        International Atomic Energy Agency;

                        by the United Nations under United Nations 
                        Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015);
                            (x) research and development is carried out 
                        in the IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, or IR-8 centrifuges in 
                        a manner that accumulates enriched uranium, or 
                        Iran installs or tests those centrifuges beyond 
                        the enrichment and enrichment research and

                        2 single centrifuges for each type is carried 
                        out on any centrifuge other than the IR-2m, IR-
                        4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-6s, IR-7, or IR-8; or
