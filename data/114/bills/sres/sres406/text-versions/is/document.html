                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the Girl Scouts of the United States of America on the 
 100th Anniversary of the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in 
  the Girl Scouts, which has stood for excellence and leadership for 
                      girls everywhere since 1916.

Whereas each girl who pursues the Girl Scout Gold Award aspires to transform an 
        original idea and vision for change into an actionable plan with far 
        reaching and sustainable results;
Whereas for more than a century preceding the date of adoption of this 
        resolution, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (referred to 
        in this preamble as the ``Girl Scouts'') has inspired girls to lead with 
        courage, confidence, and character;
Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award represents the highest form of the ideals of 
        courage, confidence, and character;
Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award calls on a Girl Scout in grades 9 through 12 
        to take on a project that has a measurable and sustainable impact on the 
        community of the Girl Scout by--

    (1) assessing a need;

    (2) designing a solution to the need;

    (3) completing the project; and

    (4) inspiring others to sustain the project;

Whereas the highest award in Girl Scouting honors leadership in the tradition of 
        the Girl Scouts;
Whereas the Girl Scout movement began on March 12, 1912, when Juliette ``Daisy'' 
        Gordon Low, a native of Savannah, Georgia, organized a group of 18 girls 
        and provided the group of girls with an opportunity to develop 
        physically, intellectually, socially, and spiritually;
Whereas the goals of Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon Low were to bring girls of all 
        backgrounds together to develop self-reliance and resourcefulness, and 
        to prepare each girl for a future role as a professional woman and 
        active citizen outside the home;
Whereas shortly after the inception of the Girl Scout movement, it was decided 
        that there should be a special recognition for each girl who--

    (1) represents the very best of the Girl Scouts; and

    (2) through courage, tenacity, dedication, and skill, takes action in 
her community with an immediate and sustainable impact;

Whereas, in 1916, the Golden Eaglet was introduced as the highest award in Girl 
        Scouting;
Whereas the highest award in Girl Scouting has been known as the Golden Eaglet, 
        the Curved Bar Award, First Class, and, for the period of 35 years 
        preceding the date of adoption of this resolution, the Girl Scout Gold 
        Award;
Whereas although the name of the highest award in Girl Scouting has changed over 
        the years, the conviction, dynamism, and idealism it takes to earn the 
        award have not;
Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award, like each girl who earns the award and the 
        project the girl undertakes--

    (1) stands as an enduring symbol of the fortitude and personal strength 
of a Girl Scout; and

    (2) clearly demonstrates the tangible, real-world impact that 
participation in the Girl Scouts can have on the life of a girl, and by 
extension, the community of the girl and the world;

Whereas earning the Girl Scout Gold Award is comparable to achieving the rank of 
        Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America;
Whereas a girl who earns the Girl Scout Gold Award--

    (1) joins an elite group of less than 6 percent of Girl Scouts each 
year; and

    (2) may be eligible for a higher grade when enlisting in the Armed 
Forces of the United States or for scholarships at certain institutions of 
higher education;

Whereas according to a study of the Girl Scout Research Institute entitled ``The 
        Power of the Girl Scout Gold Award: Excellence in Leadership and Life'', 
        recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award, compared to nonrecipient 
        peers--

    (1) report a more positive sense of self;

    (2) are more engaged civically and in community service;

    (3) have more confidence in their leadership abilities; and

    (4) experience greater life satisfaction and success;

Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award acknowledges the power and dedication of each 
        young woman to better herself and to make the world a better place for 
        other individuals;
Whereas during the century preceding the date of adoption of this resolution, 
        millions of Girl Scout alumnae have positively impacted their 
        communities and the world with creative, effective, and sustainable Take 
        Action projects; and
Whereas in the centennial of the Girl Scout Gold Award, the Girl Scouts invites 
        alumnae and supporters of the Girl Scouts everywhere to ``Celebrate 100 
        Years of Changing the World'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the remarkable impact that recipients of the 
        Girl Scout Gold Award during the century preceding the date of 
        adoption of this resolution have had on--
                    (A) the lives of individuals in the United States; 
                and
                    (B) the world;
            (2) recognizes the lasting impact of the projects of 
        recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award on the communities of 
        the recipients;
            (3) congratulates the Girl Scouts of the United States of 
        America and Girl Scout Gold Award recipients everywhere on the 
        centennial of the Girl Scout Gold Award; and
            (4) joins the Girl Scouts of the United States of America 
        in celebrating 100 years of the Girl Scout Gold Award.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
