                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the Golden State Warriors for winning the 2015 National 
                  Basketball Association Championship.

Whereas, on June 16, 2015, the Golden State Warriors won their second National 
        Basketball Association (referred to in this preamble as the ``NBA'') 
        Championship as a California team by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 
        with a score of 105-97 in the sixth game of the NBA Finals;
Whereas during the 2015 NBA playoffs, the Warriors defeated the New Orleans 
        Pelicans, the Memphis Grizzlies, the Houston Rockets, and the Cleveland 
        Cavaliers en route to the NBA Championship;
Whereas during the playoffs, the Golden State Warriors twice overcame 2-1 series 
        deficits and, in both series, responded with 3 straight victories to win 
        the series;
Whereas in the regular season, the Warriors won a league-best 67 games;
Whereas all 15 players on the 2014-2015 Warriors roster should be congratulated, 
        including NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, the NBA regular season MVP 
        Stephen Curry, as well as, Leandro Barbosa, Harrison Barnes, Andrew 
        Bogut, Festus Ezeli, Draymond Green, Justin Holiday, Ognjen Kuzmic, 
        David Lee, Shaun Livingston, James Michael McAdoo, Brandon Rush, 
        Marreesse Speights, and Klay Thompson;
Whereas first-year coach, Steve Kerr, did a tremendous job leading the Warriors 
        to the NBA Title and, through his coaching, built a team that is the 
        best in the NBA; and
Whereas the fans of the Warriors have been ever-loyal in their support of the 
        team, waiting 40 years for their second NBA title, but can now again 
        call their team a champion: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Golden State Warriors for winning the 
        2015 National Basketball Association Championship because of 
        their selfless teamwork;
            (2) recognizes the achievements of all the players, 
        coaches, and staff who contributed to the 2014-2015 season; and
            (3) celebrates the unique contributions of the Warriors fan 
        base, who, through its unremitting and vocal support of the 
        Warriors came to be known as ``Dub Nation''.
