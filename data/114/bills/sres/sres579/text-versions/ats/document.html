                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 40th Anniversary of the first class of women admitted 
                      to the Coast Guard Academy.

Whereas, on August 11, 1975, the Department of Transportation announced Coast 
        Guard Commandant Admiral Siler's decision to admit women to the Coast 
        Guard Academy, making it the first military service academy open to 
        women;
Whereas, on October 7, 1975, President Ford signed the Department of Defense 
        Appropriation Authorization Act, 1976 (Public Law 94-106; 89 Stat. 531) 
        which authorized the admission of women into the remaining three 
        military service academies, two months after the Coast Guard Academy's 
        decision to do so;
Whereas, on February 3, 1976, the Coast Guard Academy was the first military 
        service academy to issue appointments to women;
Whereas, on June 28, 1976, 38 women joined the Class of 1980 as freshmen and 
        reported to the Coast Guard Academy for Swab Summer training;
Whereas, in 1980, the first fourteen women were honored at the Coast Guard 
        Academy's 99th graduation;
Whereas, since the Coast Guard Academy's Class of 1980, more than 1,500 women 
        have graduated from the Coast Guard Academy;
Whereas, in June 2016, the Coast Guard Academy's Class of 2020 hit a record of 
        38 percent female enrollment, an enrollment rate higher than any other 
        military service academy;
Whereas the Coast Guard has been at the forefront of expanding opportunities for 
        women and setting a precedent for the advancement of women in the Armed 
        Forces; and
Whereas women serving in the Coast Guard have played vital roles in maritime law 
        enforcement, search and rescue missions, and environmental protection 
        initiatives and women continue to carry out an array of civil and 
        military responsibilities that ensure the maritime security of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the Coast Guard Academy on the 40th Anniversary 
        of the Academy enrolling female cadets and recognizes the Coast 
        Guard Academy as the first military service academy to admit 
        female cadets;
            (2) recognizes the contribution women have made through 
        their leadership, honor, and devotion to duty as members of the 
        Coast Guard; and
            (3) commends the Coast Guard Academy for breaking barriers 
        and creating equal opportunities for women in the Armed Forces.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
