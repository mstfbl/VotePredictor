 Recognizing the roles and contributions of the teachers of the United 
  States to building and enhancing the civic, cultural, and economic 
                    well-being of the United States.

Whereas education and knowledge provide the foundation of the current and future 
        strength of the United States;
Whereas teachers and other education staff have earned and deserve the respect 
        of students and communities for the selfless dedication of the teachers 
        to community service and to the futures of the children of the United 
        States;
Whereas the purpose of National Teacher Appreciation Week, celebrated from May 4 
        through May 8, 2015, is to raise public awareness of the unquantifiable 
        contributions of teachers and to promote greater respect and 
        understanding for the teaching profession; and
Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations 
        representing educators are hosting teacher appreciation events in 
        recognition of National Teacher Appreciation Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate thanks the teachers of the United States 
and promotes the profession of teaching by encouraging students, 
parents, school administrators, and public officials to participate in 
teacher appreciation events during National Teacher Appreciation Week.
                                 <all>
