                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month, commending domestic violence victim advocates, domestic violence 
 victim service providers, crisis hotline staff, and first responders 
serving victims of domestic violence for their compassionate support of 
 victims of domestic violence, and expressing the sense of the Senate 
   that Congress should continue to support efforts to end domestic 
    violence and hold perpetrators of domestic violence accountable.

Whereas domestic violence victim advocates, domestic violence service providers, 
        domestic violence first responders, and other individuals in the United 
        States observe the month of October, 2015, as ``National Domestic 
        Violence Awareness Month'' in order to increase awareness in the United 
        States about the issue of domestic violence;
Whereas it is estimated that each year up to 9,000,000 individuals in the United 
        States are victims of intimate partner violence, including--

    (1) physical violence;

    (2) rape; or

    (3) stalking;

Whereas more than 1 in 5 women in the United States and up to 1 in 7 men in the 
        United States have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate 
        partner;
Whereas domestic violence affects women, men, and children of every age and 
        background, but women--

    (1) experience more domestic violence than men; and

    (2) are significantly more likely than men to be injured during an 
assault by an intimate partner;

Whereas women aged 18 to 34 typically experience the highest rates of intimate 
        partner violence, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics;
Whereas most female victims of intimate partner violence have been victimized by 
        the same offender previously;
Whereas domestic violence is cited as a significant factor in homelessness among 
        families;
Whereas research shows that households in which children are abused or neglected 
        are likely to have a higher rate of intimate partner violence;
Whereas millions of children are exposed to domestic violence each year;
Whereas victims of domestic violence experience immediate and long-term negative 
        outcomes, including detrimental effects on mental and physical health;
Whereas crisis hotlines serving domestic violence operate 24 hours per day, 365 
        days per year, and offer important--

    (1) crisis intervention;

    (2) support;

    (3) information; and

    (4) referrals for victims;

Whereas staff and volunteers of domestic violence shelters and programs in the 
        United States, in cooperation with 56 State and territorial coalitions 
        against domestic violence, serve--

    (1) thousands of adults and children each day; and

    (2) at least 1,000,000 adults and children each year;

Whereas law enforcement officers in the United States put their lives at risk 
        each day by responding to incidents of domestic violence, which can be 
        among the most volatile and deadly disturbance calls;
Whereas Congress first demonstrated a significant commitment to supporting 
        victims of domestic violence through the landmark enactment of the 
        Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.);
Whereas Congress has remained committed to protecting survivors of all forms of 
        domestic violence and sexual abuse by making Federal funding available 
        to support the activities that are authorized under--

    (1) the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et 
seq.); and

    (2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13925 et seq.);

Whereas there is a need to continue to support programs and activities aimed at 
        domestic violence intervention and domestic violence prevention in the 
        United States; and
Whereas individuals and organizations that are dedicated to preventing and 
        ending domestic violence should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate supports the goals and ideals of ``National 
        Domestic Violence Awareness Month''; and
            (2) it is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
                    (A) continue to raise awareness of domestic 
                violence in the United States and the corresponding 
                devastating effects of domestic violence on survivors, 
                families, and communities; and
                    (B) pledge continued support for programs 
                designed--
                            (i) to assist survivors;
                            (ii) to hold perpetrators accountable; and
                            (iii) to bring an end to domestic violence.
