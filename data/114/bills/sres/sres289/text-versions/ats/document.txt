   Designating the week beginning on October 18, 2015, as ``National 
                           Chemistry Week''.

Whereas chemistry is the science of basic units of matter and, consequently, 
        plays a role in every aspect of human life;
Whereas chemistry has broad applications, including food science, paints and 
        coatings, water quality, energy, sustainability, medicine, and 
        electronics;
Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to improving the quality of human life 
        and plays an important role in addressing critical global challenges;
Whereas innovations in chemistry continue to spur economic growth and job 
        creation and have applications for a wide range of industries;
Whereas National Chemistry Week is part of a broader vision to improve human 
        life through chemistry and to advance the chemistry enterprise and the 
        practitioners of that enterprise for the benefit of communities and the 
        environment;
Whereas the purpose of National Chemistry Week is to reach the public with 
        educational messages about chemistry in order to foster greater 
        understanding of and appreciation for the applications and benefits of 
        chemistry;
Whereas National Chemistry Week strives to stimulate the interest of young 
        people, including women and underrepresented groups, in enthusiastically 
        studying science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and in 
        pursuing science-related careers that lead to innovations and major 
        scientific breakthroughs;
Whereas National Chemistry Week highlights many of the everyday uses of 
        chemistry, including in food, dyes and pigments, plastics, soaps and 
        detergents, health products, and energy technologies; and
Whereas students who participate in National Chemistry Week deserve recognition 
        and support for their efforts: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on October 18, 2015, as 
        ``National Chemistry Week'';
            (2) supports the goals of and welcomes the participants in 
        the 28th annual National Chemistry Week;
            (3) recognizes the need to promote the fields of science, 
        including chemistry, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
        and encourage youth to pursue careers in these fields; and
            (4) commends the American Chemical Society and the partners 
        of that society for organizing and convening events and 
        activities surrounding National Chemistry Week each year.
