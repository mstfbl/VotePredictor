    Designating the week of January 24 through January 30, 2016, as 
                    ``National School Choice Week''.

Whereas providing a diversity of choices in K-12 education empowers parents to 
        select education environments that meet the individual needs and 
        strengths of their children;
Whereas high-quality K-12 education environments of all varieties are available 
        in the United States, including traditional public schools, public 
        charter schools, public magnet schools, private schools, online 
        academies, and home schooling;
Whereas talented teachers and school leaders in each of the education 
        environments prepare children to achieve their dreams;
Whereas more families than ever before in the United States actively choose the 
        best education for their children;
Whereas more public awareness of the issue of parental choice in education can 
        inform additional families of the benefits of proactively choosing 
        challenging, motivating, and effective education environments for their 
        children;
Whereas the process by which parents choose schools for their children is 
        nonpolitical, nonpartisan, and deserves the utmost respect; and
Whereas hundreds of organizations, more than 9,000 schools, and millions of 
        individuals in the United States celebrate the benefits of educational 
        choice during the 6\th\ annual National School Choice Week, held the 
        week of January 24 through January 30, 2016: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of January 24 through January 30, 
        2016, as ``National School Choice Week'';
            (2) congratulates students, parents, teachers, and school 
        leaders from K-12 education environments of all varieties for 
        their persistence, achievements, dedication, and contributions 
        to society in the United States;
            (3) encourages all parents, during National School Choice 
        Week, to learn more about the education options available to 
        them; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to hold 
        appropriate programs, events, and activities during National 
        School Choice Week to raise public awareness of the benefits of 
        opportunity in education.
