                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Reserve Officers' Training 
                       Corps program of the Army.

Whereas June 3, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of the Reserve Officers' 
        Training Corps program of the Army (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``Army ROTC'');
Whereas Congress established Army ROTC and the Naval Reserve Officer Training 
        Corps in the Act of June 3, 1916 (39 Stat. 166, chapter 134) (commonly 
        known as the ``National Defense Act of 1916'');
Whereas the Army has commissioned more than 650,000 officers from Army ROTC;
Whereas Army ROTC serves as a critical component for the training of men and 
        women to take command, protecting the national security of the United 
        States and way of life of individuals in the United States;
Whereas Army ROTC produces the next generation of innovative and adaptive 
        leaders while providing those leaders with essential collegiate 
        educational opportunities;
Whereas Army ROTC commissioned 5,536 officers in 2014;
Whereas Army ROTC produced 21 4-star generals between 2000 and 2016;
Whereas Army ROTC is available at nearly 1,000 institutions of higher education 
        across all 50 States and all territories;
Whereas the Army has included in Army ROTC programs such as the Green to Gold 
        and Simultaneous Membership programs to allow an enlisted member of the 
        Army to gain a college education and become an officer of the Army;
Whereas women have been an integral part of Army ROTC since academic year 1972-
        1973; and
Whereas Army ROTC serves as a way for an individual to gain a college education 
        and serve the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program of the 
        Army (referred to in this resolving clause as ``Army ROTC'') 
        continues to train the next generation of military leaders, who 
        are well-equipped to defeat existing enemies of the United 
        States and those enemies that may emerge in the future;
            (2) the Senate is encouraged by the quality of leaders that 
        Army ROTC has and will continue to produce; and
            (3) as of the date of adoption of this resolution, Army 
        ROTC produces more Army officers than any other source.
                                 <all>
