                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the 
     lasting significance of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.

Whereas, on December 7, 1941, without warning and minutes before 8:00 a.m., 
        aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked military installations 
        of the United States at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere on the island of 
        Oahu, Hawaii;
Whereas the attack at Pearl Harbor lasted for approximately 5 hours, during 
        which 2,403 members of the Armed Forces of the United States were killed 
        or mortally wounded, 1,247 members of the Armed Forces of the United 
        States were wounded, and 57 civilians lost their lives;
Whereas Japanese aircraft mercilessly attacked facilities, naval vessels, and 
        aircraft of the United States in 2 waves, destroying or severely 
        damaging numerous vessels of the United States Pacific Fleet and 188 
        aircraft of the United States, while Japanese submarines torpedoed 
        several vessels of the United States between San Francisco and Honolulu;
Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the day of the attack on 
        Pearl Harbor ``a date which will live in infamy'', and the people of the 
        United States became united in remembrance of their fallen countrymen 
        and committed to defending the United States against all aggressors;
Whereas, on the day following the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 8, 1941, 
        Congress declared war against Japan, and 3 days later against Germany, 
        thus beginning the involvement of the United States in a global conflict 
        that would define a generation;
Whereas more than 400,000 men and women of the United States sacrificed their 
        lives to preserve the sacred freedoms of the United States and to cease 
        forever the spread of Nazism through Europe and imperialism by Japan;
Whereas, after nearly 4 years of warfare, and following victory on the European 
        front, World War II ended on September 2, 1945, when the Japanese 
        surrendered aboard the USS Missouri;
Whereas, in 1950, Admiral Arthur Radford ordered that a flagpole be erected over 
        the remains of the USS Arizona, one of the battleships of the United 
        States sunk at Pearl Harbor;
Whereas the USS Arizona serves as the final resting place for many of the 1,177 
        crew members of that battleship who lost their lives on December 7, 
        1941;
Whereas the USS Arizona also serves as an educational site for people of the 
        United States and international visitors alike, raising awareness about 
        the attack on Pearl Harbor and the perils of war;
Whereas the terms of the Japanese surrender fostered significant democratic 
        reform in Japan, including ensuring the individual liberty and rights of 
        the people of Japan;
Whereas the United States has moved beyond the tragedy of Pearl Harbor and war 
        against Japan and, in the years since the conclusion of World War II, 
        has formed a strong and valuable alliance with Japan, including military 
        cooperation and bilateral trade; and
Whereas, on August 23, 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-308 (later codified 
        as section 129 of title 36, United States Code), which designates 
        December 7th of each year as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and 
        requests that the President--

    (1) issue each year a proclamation calling on the people of the United 
States to observe National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities; and

    (2) urge all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the 
Federal Government, and interested organizations, groups, and individuals, 
to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff each December 7th in 
honor of the individuals who died as a result of their service at Pearl 
Harbor: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary 
of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii--
            (1) pays tribute to the members of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States and civilians who died in the attack;
            (2) honors the thousands of men and women of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States who paid the ultimate sacrifice and 
        gave their lives in defense of freedom and liberty during World 
        War II;
            (3) acknowledges the continued peaceful and mutually 
        beneficial relationship between the United States and Japan; 
        and
            (4) appreciates the efforts of Japan as one of the most 
        reliable security partners of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
