                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the week beginning November 2, 2015, as ``National 
                         Apprenticeship Week''.

Whereas a highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in the global economy 
        and to support economic growth;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system established by the Act of 
        August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``National 
        Apprenticeship Act'') (referred to in this preamble as the ``national 
        registered apprenticeship system''), which has existed for over 75 
        years--

    (1) is an important pathway for workers of the United States;

    (2) offers a combination of--

    G    (A) academic and technical instruction; and

    G    (B) paid, on-the-job, training;

    (3) provides workers of the United States credentials that are 
nationally-recognized and industry-recognized;

    (4) leads to higher earnings for apprentices; and

    (5) develops a highly skilled workforce for the United States;

Whereas registered apprenticeships--

    (1) are becoming increasingly innovative and diverse in--

    G    (A) design;

    G    (B) partnerships;

    G    (C) timeframes; and

    G    (D) use of emerging educational and training concepts; and

    (2) will continue to--

    G    (A) evolve to meet emerging skill essentials and employer 
requirements; and

    G    (B) maintain high standards for apprentices;

Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system provides education and 
        training for apprentices in--

    (1) high-growth sectors, including--

    G    (A) information technology;

    G    (B) financial services;

    G    (C) advanced manufacturing; and

    G    (D) health care; and

    (2) traditional industries;

Whereas, according to the Department of Labor, the national registered 
        apprenticeship system leverages approximately $1,000,000,000 in private 
        investment, which reflects the strong commitment of the sponsors of the 
        national registered apprenticeship system;
Whereas an evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs in 10 States 
        conducted by Mathematica Policy Research in 2012 found that--

    (1) individuals who completed registered apprenticeship programs earned 
over $240,000 more over their careers than individuals who did not 
participate in registered apprenticeship programs;

    (2) the estimated social benefits of each registered apprenticeship 
program (including additional productivity of apprentices and the reduction 
in governmental expenditures as a result of reduced use of unemployment 
compensation and public assistance) exceeded the costs of each registered 
apprenticeship program by more than $49,000; and

    (3) the tax return on every dollar the Federal Government invested in 
registered apprenticeship programs was $27; and

Whereas celebration of National Apprenticeship Week--

    (1) honors industries that use the registered apprenticeship model;

    (2) encourages expansion of the registered apprenticeship model to 
prepare highly skilled workers of the United States;

    (3) recognizes the role the national registered apprenticeship system 
has played in preparing workers of the United States for jobs; and

    (4) promotes conversation about ways the national registered 
apprenticeship system can continue to respond to workforce challenges in 
the 21\st\ century: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate designates the week beginning November 2, 
2015, as ``National Apprenticeship Week''.
