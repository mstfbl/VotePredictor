        history;
Whereas the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous resilience and skill over the 
        past 4 seasons, with 58 wins to only 3 losses, including a streak of 33

Whereas an estimated 17,000 Bison fans attended the Championship game, 
        reflecting the tremendous spirit and dedication of Bison Nation that has
