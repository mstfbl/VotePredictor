                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting efforts to place a woman on the currency of the United 
                                States.

Whereas Andrew Jackson, though a military hero in the War of 1812, as President, 
        instated Federal policies, including the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. 
        411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal Act''), to 
        remove millions of American Indians from their historic homelands to 
        what is now the State of Oklahoma, which accelerated the settlement of 
        Indian lands across the Great Plains and throughout the West;
Whereas the removal policies enforced by Andrew Jackson led to the reductions of 
        the homelands, and ultimately the deaths, of thousands of American 
        Indians across the continent;
Whereas the forced removal of American Indians by Andrew Jackson and the 
        subsequent inhumane settlement of Indian lands represent a major blight 
        on the proud history of the United States; and
Whereas, beginning prior to the founding of the United States and continuing 
        through the present day, the women of the United States, including 
        American Indian women, have worked without due recognition and should be 
        provided the necessary respect and gratitude by all people of the United 
        States for innumerable contributions to the culture, families, economy, 
        innovation, military, and way of life of the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports--
            (1) efforts to recognize the contributions of countless 
        women to the history of the United States by placing a woman on 
        the currency of the United States;
            (2) the removal of Andrew Jackson from the $20 Federal 
        reserve note; and
            (3) the placement of a significant woman from the history 
        of the United States on the $20 Federal reserve note.
                                 <all>
