     Congratulating the community colleges of Iowa for 50 years of 
 outstanding service to the State of Iowa, the United States, and the 
                                 world.

Whereas Senate File 550 in the Iowa State Senate, which provided for the 
        establishment and operation of area community colleges in Iowa, was 
        signed into law by Governor Harold Hughes on June 7, 1965, creating a 
        new community college system in Iowa;
Whereas each of the community colleges of Iowa was officially designated by the 
        State Board of Education in 1966, including--

    (1) Northeast Iowa Community College, North Iowa Area Community 
College, Northwest Iowa Community College, Iowa Central Community College, 
Southwestern Community College, and Indian Hills Community College on 
February 18, 1966;

    (2) Hawkeye Community College, the Eastern Iowa Community Colleges,

    (5) Western Iowa Tech Community College on August 19, 1966; and

    (6) Iowa Lakes Community College on October 28, 1966;

Whereas, 50 years later, the community colleges of Iowa have grown to be the 
        largest postsecondary institutions in the State, providing accessible 
        and affordable education to a diverse range of students in Iowa and 
        around the world;
Whereas, 50 years later, the community colleges of Iowa are leaders in 
        delivering college parallel courses and career technical education 
        programs to high schools students in Iowa;
Whereas, 50 years later, the community colleges of Iowa provide opportunities in 
        adult literacy and basic education to low-skilled workers, immigrants, 
        and refugees;
Whereas, 50 years later, the workforce of Iowa has nearly 25,000,000 credit 
        hours and more than 138,000,000 contact hours of past and present 
        community college training;
Whereas, 50 years later, the community colleges of Iowa lead the response to the 
        specific workforce needs of communities in Iowa, including the ability 
        for Iowa businesses to compete in global markets; and
Whereas, 50 years later, the community colleges of Iowa are the leaders in 
        providing skills training for high-demand, high-paying, high-skilled 
        occupations and career enhancement opportunities for Iowa workers: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates and commends the community colleges of 
        Iowa for 50 years of--
                    (A) developing and sustaining accessible and 
                quality higher education opportunities for all Iowans; 
                and
                    (B) service to Iowa and the United States; and
            (2) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit a 
        copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the Board Chair of the Iowa Association of 
                Community College Trustees; and
                    (B) the Chair of the Iowa Association of Community 
                College Presidents.
