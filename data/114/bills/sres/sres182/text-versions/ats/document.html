                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate that Defense laboratories have been, 
and continue to be, on the cutting edge of scientific and technological 
  advancement and supporting the designation of May 14, 2015, as the 
               ``Department of Defense Laboratory Day''.

Whereas a Defense laboratory is defined as any laboratory, Department of 
        Defense-funded research and development center, or engineering center 
        that is owned by a military service and funded by the Federal 
        Government;
Whereas Defense laboratories should be commended for the unique role the 
        laboratories have played in numerous innovations and advances in the 
        areas of defense and national security;
Whereas technological progress is responsible for up to half the growth of the 
        United States economy and is the principal driving force behind long-
        term economic growth and increases in the standard of living in the 
        United States;
Whereas defense-supported research and development has led to new products and 
        processes for state-of-the-art military weapons and technology, as well 
        as for the public good;
Whereas Defense laboratories frequently partner with State and local governments 
        and regional organizations to transfer technology to the private sector;
Whereas Defense laboratories are at the forefront of cutting-edge science and 
        technology, earning prestigious national and international awards for 
        research and technology transfer efforts;
Whereas the innovations produced at the Defense laboratories of the United 
        States fuel economic growth by creating new industries, companies, and 
        jobs;
Whereas the work of the Defense laboratories is essential to the continued 
        prosperity of the United States; and
Whereas May 14, 2015, would be an appropriate day to designate as the 
        ``Department of Defense Laboratory Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of May 14, 2015, as the 
        ``Department of Defense Laboratory Day'' in recognition of the 
        work and accomplishments of the national network of Defense 
        laboratories;
            (2) recognizes that supporting research and development, 
        including federally sponsored work performed at the Defense 
        laboratories, is key to maintaining United States innovation 
        and competitiveness in a global economy;
            (3) acknowledges that the knowledge base, technologies, and 
        techniques generated in the Defense laboratory system serve as 
        a foundation for the defense industrial base;
            (4) reaffirms the importance of robust investment in 
        Defense laboratories to preserving the technological 
        superiority of the Armed Forces in the 21st century; and
            (5) encourages the Defense laboratories, the executive 
        branch agencies, and Congress to hold an outreach event on May 
        14, 2015, ``Department of Defense Laboratory Day'', to raise 
        public awareness of the work of the Defense laboratories.
