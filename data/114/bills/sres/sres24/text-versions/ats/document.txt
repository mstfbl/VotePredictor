                               RESOLUTION


 
      Recognizing the 150th anniversary of Bowie State University.

Whereas on January 9, 2015, Bowie State University, located in Bowie, Maryland, 
        will celebrate the founding of the university on January 9, 1865;
Whereas Bowie State University is the oldest historically black institution of 
        higher education in the State of Maryland, and 1 of the 10 oldest in the 
        United States;
Whereas in 1864 the Baltimore Association began fundraising to open and support 
        schools for African-Americans, and established 7 schools, the second of 
        which, known as the ``Normal School'' (referred to in this preamble as 
        the ``School''), was the forerunner of Bowie State University;
Whereas the School began by educating approximately 370 students in the African 
        Baptist Church in the Crane's Building on the northeast corner of 
        Calvert and Saratoga Streets in Baltimore, Maryland;
Whereas in 1867 the School purchased the Friends' Meeting House at the corner of 
        Courtland and Saratoga Streets in Baltimore, Maryland, to use for the 
        School;
Whereas during the earliest years of the School, the school received financial 
        support from the City Council of Baltimore, the Freedmen's Bureau, 
        several northern relief societies, and the estate of Nelson Wells;
Whereas in 1893 the name of the School was changed to the ``Baltimore Colored 
        Normal School'';
Whereas in 1908 the General Assembly of Maryland approved legislation that 
        allowed the trustees of the School to donate assets of the trustees to 
        the State of Maryland in return for a $5,000 annual appropriation to 
        maintain a permanent normal school for the training of black teachers;
Whereas in 1908 the General Assembly of Maryland changed the name of the School 
        to ``Baltimore Normal School No. 3'';
Whereas in 1910 the State of Maryland purchased 187 acres of land formerly known 
        as ``Jericho Farms'' to relocate the School;
Whereas in September 1911 the new location of the School opened with 50 students 
        enrolled;
Whereas in 1935 the School began operating as a 4-year program for training 
        elementary school teachers and was renamed the ``Maryland Teachers 
        College at Bowie'';
Whereas in 1954, when the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher 
        Education was formed, the education program of the School was among the 
        first to receive national accreditation and that distinction has been 
        continuously reaffirmed;
Whereas in 1963 the School began a liberal arts and teacher training program for 
        secondary education and the institution was renamed ``Bowie State 
        College'';
Whereas in 1988 the School, which offered several master's degree programs, 
        joined the University System of Maryland and was finally renamed ``Bowie 
        State University'';
Whereas in 1995 Bowie State University became 1 of only 6 Model Institutions for 
        Excellence in science, engineering, and mathematics in the United States 
        with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;
Whereas as of January 2015, Bowie State University serves approximately 5,600 
        students annually with challenging and rewarding academic programs and 
        individual support to prepare attendees with the skills needed to 
        compete and succeed in a changing world;
Whereas Bowie State University was listed as 1 of ``America's Top Colleges'' by 
        Forbes magazine from 2011 to 2013, and ranked among the top 25 
        historically black colleges and universities by U.S. News & World 
        Report;
Whereas Bowie State University has been recognized as a leader in training 
        African-American professionals in the science, technology, engineering, 
        and mathematics (``STEM'') fields;
Whereas Bowie State University was named a National Center for Academic 
        Excellence in Information Assurance Education by the National Security 
        Agency and the Department of Homeland Security; and
Whereas Bowie State University continues to be committed to enhancing academic 
        opportunities for students at the university, many of whom may be the 
        first in their families attending college, and producing graduates who 
        better strengthen the entire State of Maryland and the modern 
        technology-driven economy of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates Bowie State University on the 150th 
        anniversary of the founding of the university;
            (2) recognizes the achievements of all the administrators, 
        professors, students, and various staff who have contributed to 
        the success of Bowie State University; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the president of Bowie State University; and
                    (B) the provost and vice president for academic 
                affairs.
                                 <all>
