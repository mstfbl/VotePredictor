                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 25, 2015

 Mr. Whitehouse (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating March 2015 as ``National Middle Level Education Month''.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the Association 
        for Middle Level Education, the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-
        Grades Reform, and the National Association of Elementary School 
        Principals have declared March 2015 as ``National Middle Level Education 
        Month'';
Whereas schools that educate middle level students are responsible for educating 
        nearly 24,000,000 young adolescents between the ages of 10 and 15, in 
        grades 5 through 9, who are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes in 
        their physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral development;
Whereas young adolescents deserve challenging and engaging instruction and 
        knowledgeable teachers and administrators who are prepared to provide 
        young adolescents with a safe, challenging, and supportive learning 
        environment;
Whereas young adolescents deserve organizational structures that banish 
        anonymity and promote personalization, collaboration, and social equity;
Whereas the habits and values established during early adolescence have a 
        lifelong influence that directly affects the future health and welfare 
        of the United States;
Whereas research indicates that the academic achievement of a student in grade 8 
        has a larger impact on the readiness of that student for an institution 
        of higher education at the end of high school than any academic 
        achievement of that student in high school; and
Whereas in order to improve graduation rates and prepare students to be lifelong 
        learners who are ready for an institution of higher education or a 
        career and civic participation, the people of the United States must 
        have a deeper understanding of the distinctive mission of middle level 
        education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 2015 as ``National Middle Level 
        Education Month'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the importance of middle level 
        education and the contributions of the individuals who educate 
        middle level students; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Middle Level Education Month by visiting and 
        celebrating schools that are responsible for educating young 
        adolescents in the United States.
