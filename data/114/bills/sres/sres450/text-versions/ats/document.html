Honoring May 1 through May 7, 2016, as ``National Small Business Week'' 
and celebrating the contributions of small businesses and entrepreneurs 
                in every community in the United States.

Whereas ``National Small Business Week'' has been declared by every President 
        since 1963;
Whereas there are more than 28,000,000 small businesses in the United States;
Whereas nearly 90 percent of United States employers have fewer than 20 
        employees;
Whereas small businesses in the United States--

    (1) represent 99.7 percent of all businesses with employees;

    (2) employ over 48 percent of employees in the private sector;

    (3) constitute 98 percent of businesses that export goods; and

    (4) account for more than 46 percent of private sector output;

Whereas, on July 30, 1953, Congress established the Small Business 
        Administration to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of 
        small businesses--

    (1) to preserve free and competitive enterprise;

    (2) to ensure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government 
property are made to small businesses; and

    (3) to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the United 
States;

Whereas 63 percent of new jobs are created by small businesses; and
Whereas May 1 through May 7, 2016, will be celebrated as ``National Small 
        Business Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors May 1 through May 7, 2016, as ``National Small 
        Business Week'';
            (2) celebrates the contributions of small businesses and 
        entrepreneurs in every community in the United States during 
        National Small Business Week;
            (3) recognizes the importance of--
                    (A) creating policies that promote an environment 
                in which small businesses may succeed; and
                    (B) the Small Business Administration as a valuable 
                resource for entrepreneurs in the United States; and
            (4) supports efforts--
                    (A) to encourage consumers to use small businesses; 
                and
                    (B) to increase awareness of the value of small 
                businesses and the impact of small businesses on the 
                economy of the United States.
