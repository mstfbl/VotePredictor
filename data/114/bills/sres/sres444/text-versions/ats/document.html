             Honoring the life and achievements of Prince.

Whereas Prince Rogers Nelson (referred to in this preamble as ``Prince'') was 
        born on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, Minnesota;
Whereas Prince developed an interest in music at an early age and wrote his 
        first song at the age of 7 years;
Whereas Prince pioneered the Minneapolis sound, which is a mixture of funk, 
        rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and influenced 
        music for decades;
Whereas Prince and his band, the Revolution, shot many scenes of the classic 
        film ``Purple Rain'' at First Avenue, making the downtown Minneapolis 
        music venue a landmark;
Whereas Prince was a superstar composer, an amazing performer, and a music 
        innovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art;
Whereas Prince--

    (1) sold more than 100,000,000 records worldwide;

    (2) released 39 studio albums;

    (3) had 5 number 1 Billboard hits; and

    (4) had 40 singles in the top 100 songs;

Whereas Prince won 7 Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award;
Whereas Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the 
        first year in which Prince was eligible for induction;
Whereas in 2010, Prince accepted a Black Entertainment Television Lifetime 
        Achievement Award;
Whereas Prince wrote songs about Minnesota sports teams, including ``Purple and 
        Gold'' during the Minnesota Viking's run to the 2010 National Football 
        Conference championship game, and held a concert for the Minnesota Lynx 
        after the Minnesota Lynx won their third Women's National Basketball 
        Association championship;
Whereas even after all of his success, Prince still called the State of 
        Minnesota home and never lost the sense that he was a beloved son, a 
        neighbor, and the superstar next door;
Whereas Prince reminded the people of the United States that ``there's a world 
        waiting for us after this life, a world of never ending happiness, where 
        you can always see the sun, day or night''; and
Whereas on April 21, 2016, Prince passed away at his Paisley Park Estate in 
        Chanhassen, Minnesota, leaving behind millions of fans and a legacy of 
        music that touched hearts, opened minds, and made the people of the 
        United States want to dance: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate honors the life of Prince Rogers Nelson 
and his achievements as a musician, composer, innovator, and cultural 
icon.
