                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of National Aviation Maintenance 
Technician Day, honoring the invaluable contributions of Charles Edward 
Taylor, regarded as the father of aviation maintenance, and recognizing 
the essential role of aviation maintenance technicians in ensuring the 
          safety and security of civil and military aircraft.

Whereas the safety of the flying public is ensured and the integrity of aircraft 
        airworthiness is personally guaranteed by individuals who comprise the 
        professional aviation maintenance technician workforce;
Whereas professional aviation maintenance technicians are key members of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States and help protect the United States 
        through a strong Armed Forces aviation infrastructure;
Whereas the duties of aviation maintenance technicians are critical to the 
        homeland security of the United States and an integral component of the 
        aerospace industry of the United States;
Whereas professional aviation maintenance technicians provide the strong 
        infrastructure through which public confidence in the airborne 
        transportation safety and military aviation strength of the United 
        States is ensured;
Whereas, in 1901, Charles Edward Taylor began working as a machinist for Orville 
        and Wilbur Wright at the Wright Cycle Company in Dayton, Ohio;
Whereas using only a metal lathe, drill press, and hand tools, Charles Edward 
        Taylor built, in 6 weeks, the 12-horsepower engine that was used to 
        power the first flying machine of the Wright brothers;
Whereas the ingenuity of Charles Edward Taylor earned him a place in aviation 
        history when the Wright brothers successfully flew their airplane in 
        controlled flight on December 17, 1903;
Whereas Charles Edward Taylor had a successful career in aviation maintenance 
        for more than 60 years;
Whereas Charles Edward Taylor was honored by the Federal Aviation Administration 
        with the establishment of the Charles Edward Taylor Master Mechanic 
        Award, which recognizes individuals with not less than 50 years of 
        aviation maintenance experience;
Whereas Charles Edward Taylor has become a hero to aircraft maintenance 
        technicians worldwide; and
Whereas 45 States, together with the commonwealths, territories, republics, and 
        federations of the United States, have already declared May 24 to be 
        Aviation Maintenance Technician Day within their jurisdictions: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports National Aviation Maintenance Technician Day 
        to honor the professional men and women who ensure the safety 
        and security of the airborne aviation infrastructure of the 
        United States; and
            (2) recognizes the life and memory of Charles Edward 
        Taylor, the aviation maintenance technician who built and 
        maintained the engine that was used to power the first 
        controlled flying machine of the Wright brothers on December 
        17, 1903.
