                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating May 1, 2016, as ``National Purebred Dog Day''.

Whereas the human-canine bond predates history and individuals have enjoyed the 
        companionship and assistance of dogs since the dawn of civilization;
Whereas dog ownership has existed in all cultures, races, climates, and economic 
        situations;
Whereas more than 350 dog breeds exist worldwide, and more than 180 breeds are 
        recognized by the American Kennel Club;
Whereas purebred dogs and breeders of purebred dogs have played a crucial role 
        in United States history, dating to colonial times, during which George 
        Washington had a foxhound breeding program, which established the 
        American Foxhound breed;
Whereas responsible breeders of purebred dogs dedicate their lives to improving 
        the health and well-being of dogs and preserving unique breeds of dogs;
Whereas purebred dogs were created to work alongside humans, and provide 
        inestimable service as--

    (1) search and rescue dogs;

    (2) service dogs;

    (3) disease detection dogs;

    (4) police dogs;

    (5) conservation dogs;

    (6) livestock guardians;

    (7) therapy dogs; and

    (8) companions and guardians of families, homes, and property;

Whereas purebred dogs provide unparalleled service to the disabled as guide and 
        service dogs, and are the choice of leading service dog breeding 
        programs because of the heritable intelligence, and desirable and 
        predictable qualities, of purebred dogs;
Whereas purebred military working dogs serve alongside the men and women of the 
        United States Armed Forces in combat and in peacetime;
Whereas breed instinct enables purebred dogs to readily serve as--

    (1) avalanche dogs;

    (2) trackers and trailers;

    (3) herders;

    (4) controllers of vermin;

    (5) water rescuers;

    (6) carting and sled dogs;

    (7) retrievers;

    (8) protectors;

    (9) hunters; and

    (10) bird dogs;

Whereas the first ``National Purebred Dog Day'' was established on May 1, 2015;
Whereas millions of individuals, through social media and other avenues, 
        recognize May 1 each year as ``National Purebred Dog Day'' and desire, 
        on May 1, to expressly recognize the contributions of the purebred dog; 
        and
Whereas individuals value all dogs, regardless of the ancestry of the dogs, and 
        especially cherish a purpose-bred dog and the predictability of each 
        respective breed of purpose-bred dog: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 1, 2016, as ``National Purebred Dog 
        Day'' in celebration of purebred dogs and the many service and 
        companion benefits purebred dogs have and continue to provide 
        to the United States; and
            (2) honors the dedicated and responsible breeders who work 
        to preserve and advance their breeds and responsible dog 
        ownership throughout the United States.
                                 <all>
