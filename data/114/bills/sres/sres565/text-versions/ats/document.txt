                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week beginning September 12, 2016, as ``National 
                 Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''.

Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are degree-granting institutions that have 
        a full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment of not less than 25 
        percent Hispanic students;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions play an important role in educating many 
        underprivileged students and helping those students attain their full 
        potential through higher education;
Whereas more than 400 Hispanic-Serving Institutions operate in the United 
        States;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions represent just 13 percent of all non-
        profit institutions of higher education, yet serve more than 63 percent 
        of all Hispanic undergraduate students, enrolling more than 1,750,000 
        Hispanic undergraduate students and more than 86,000 Hispanic graduate 
        students in 2014;
Whereas the number of ``emerging Hispanic-Serving Institutions'', defined as 
        institutions that do not yet meet the threshold of 25 percent Hispanic 
        enrollment but serve a Hispanic student population of between 15 and 24 
        percent, grew to more than 300 colleges and universities in 2014;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are located in 18 States and Puerto Rico 
        and emerging Hispanic-Serving Institutions are located in 33 States and 
        Washington, DC;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are actively involved in stabilizing and 
        improving the communities in which the institutions are located;
Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to 
        the United States strengthens the culture of the United States; and
Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-Serving Institutions deserve 
        national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-
        Serving Institutions across the United States;
            (2) designates the week beginning September 12, 2016, as 
        ``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week 
        with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to 
        demonstrate support for Hispanic-Serving Institutions.
                                 <all>
