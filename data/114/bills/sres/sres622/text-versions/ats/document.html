                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the goals of National Adoption Day and National 
  Adoption Month by promoting national awareness of adoption and the 
children awaiting families, celebrating children and families involved 
in adoption, and encouraging the people of the United States to secure 
          safety, permanency, and well-being for all children.

Whereas there are millions of unparented children in the world, including 
        427,910 children in the foster care system in the United States, 
        approximately 111,820 of whom are waiting for families to adopt them;
Whereas 62 percent of the children in foster care in the United States are age 
        10 or younger;
Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster care is 
        approximately 2 years;
Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving family in which the 
        children are nurtured, comforted, and protected seems endless;
Whereas, in 2015, over 20,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster care by reaching 
        adulthood without being placed in a permanent home;
Whereas every day, loving and nurturing families are strengthened and expanded 
        when committed and dedicated individuals make an important difference in 
        the life of a child through adoption;
Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption 
        demonstrated that although ``Americans overwhelmingly support the 
        concept of adoption, and in particular foster care adoption . . . foster 
        care adoptions have not increased significantly over the past 5 years'';
Whereas while nearly a quarter of individuals in the United States have 
        considered adoption, a majority of individuals in the United States have 
        misperceptions about the process of adopting children from foster care 
        and the children who are eligible for adoption;
Whereas 50 percent of individuals in the United States believe that children 
        enter the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when in 
        reality the vast majority of children who have entered the foster care 
        system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or abuse;
Whereas 39 percent of individuals in the United States believe that foster care 
        adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no substantial cost for 
        adopting from foster care and financial support is available to adoptive 
        parents after the adoption is finalized;
Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic and intercounty 
        adoption promote permanency and stability to a far greater degree than 
        long-term institutionalization or long-term, often disrupted, foster 
        care;
Whereas November is National Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day occurs in 
        November;
Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national effort to find permanent, 
        loving families for children in the foster care system;
Whereas, since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, nearly 58,500 children 
        have joined permanent families during National Adoption Day; and
Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual proclamation to declare the 
        month of November as National Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day 
        is on November 19, 2016: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day 
        and National Adoption Month;
            (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and 
        loving family; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider 
        adoption during the month of November and throughout the year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
