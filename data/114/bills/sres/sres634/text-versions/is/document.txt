                               RESOLUTION


 
 Affirming the importance of the security and privacy of the people of 
                           the United States.

Whereas the highest priority of Congress should be ensuring the safety, 
        security, and constitutional freedoms of the United States and the 
        people of the United States;
Whereas technology has become a critical component of everyday life;
Whereas the people of the United States store the most sensitive personal 
        information on digital devices and with cloud services;
Whereas criminals and terrorists have used digital communications to perpetrate 
        unlawful conduct;
Whereas protecting the national security and safety of communities in the United 
        States should not come at the cost of diminished protections under the 
        Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is a 
        cornerstone of freedom for the people of the United States;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States and Federal laws recognize 
        certain privacy rights and interests in the digital information and 
        communications of the people of the United States; and
Whereas preserving privacy and security is essential for the continued growth of 
        the digital economy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States should recognize the need to protect 
        the safety, security, and personal privacy of all people of the 
        United States;
            (2) legal and policy changes that impact the security of 
        the United States and the civil liberties of the people of the 
        United States should be made with the consideration of 
        Congress, the executive branch, and the people of the United 
        States; and
            (3) in considering the changes described in paragraph (2), 
        the United States should recognize the global and economic 
        implications of the security and privacy policies of the United 
        States.
                                 <all>
