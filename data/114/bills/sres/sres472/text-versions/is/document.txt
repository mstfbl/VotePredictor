                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the Senate that a carbon tax would be 
            detrimental to the economy of the United States.

Whereas a carbon tax is a Federal tax on carbon released from fossil fuels;
Whereas a carbon tax would increase energy prices, including the price of 
        gasoline, electricity, natural gas, and home heating oil;
Whereas a carbon tax would cause families and consumers to pay more for 
        essential items such as food, gasoline, and electricity;
Whereas a carbon tax would cause the greatest hardship for the poor, the 
        elderly, and individuals living on fixed incomes;
Whereas a carbon tax would lead to more jobs and businesses moving overseas;
Whereas a carbon tax would lead to less economic growth;
Whereas families in the United States would be harmed the most from a carbon 
        tax;
Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administration, fossil fuels have 
        made up not less than 80 percent of the total energy consumption of the 
        United States since 1990;
Whereas a carbon tax would increase the cost of every good that is manufactured 
        in the United States;
Whereas a carbon tax would impose disproportionate burdens on certain 
        industries, jobs, States, and geographic regions and would further 
        restrict the global competitiveness of the United States;
Whereas the ingenuity of the United States has led to innovations in energy 
        exploration and development and has increased production of domestic 
        energy resources on private and State-owned land, which has created 
        significant job growth and private capital investment;
Whereas the energy policy of the United States should encourage continued 
        private sector innovation and development and not increase the existing 
        tax burden on manufacturers;
Whereas the production of the energy resources of the United States increases 
        the ability of the United States to maintain a competitive advantage in 
        the global economy;
Whereas a carbon tax would reduce the global competitiveness of the United 
        States and would encourage development abroad in countries that do not 
        impose that exorbitant tax burden; and
Whereas Congress and the President should focus on pro-growth solutions that 
        encourage increased development of domestic resources: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that a carbon tax--
            (1) would be detrimental to families and businesses in the 
        United States; and
            (2) is not in the best interest of the United States.
                                 <all>
