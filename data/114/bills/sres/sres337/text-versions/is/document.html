                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of February 12, 2016, as 
    ``Darwin Day'' and recognizing the importance of science in the 
                        betterment of humanity.

Whereas Charles Darwin developed the theory of evolution by the mechanism of 
        natural selection, which, together with the monumental amount of 
        scientific evidence Charles Darwin compiled to support the theory, 
        provides humanity with a logical and intellectually compelling 
        explanation for the diversity of life on Earth;
Whereas the validity of the theory of evolution by natural selection developed 
        by Charles Darwin is further strongly supported by the modern 
        understanding of the science of genetics;
Whereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity exemplified by Charles 
        Darwin that has promoted new scientific discoveries that have helped 
        humanity solve many problems and improve living conditions;
Whereas the advancement of science must be protected from those unconcerned with 
        the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change;
Whereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools compromises the 
        scientific and academic integrity of the education systems of the United 
        States;
Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement on which to 
        focus and around which to build a global celebration of science and 
        humanity intended to promote a common bond among all the people of the 
        Earth; and
Whereas February 12, 2016, is the anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin in 
        1809 and would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Darwin Day'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Darwin Day''; and
            (2) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which 
        to celebrate the achievements of reason, science, and the 
        advancement of human knowledge.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
