                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool 
                   programs held on October 20, 2016.

Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States have parents who work 
        outside the home;
Whereas high-quality programs that expand learning opportunities for children, 
        such as afterschool, before-school, summer, and expanded learning 
        opportunities, provide safe, challenging, engaging, and fun learning 
        experiences, including experiences that encourage science, technology, 
        engineering, and math, that help children and youth develop social, 
        emotional, physical, cultural, and academic skills;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs and high-quality expanded learning 
        opportunities provide students with hands-on, engaging lessons that are 
        aligned with the school day;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs complement regular and expanded school 
        days, and support working families by ensuring that the children of 
        those families are safe and productive during the hours parents are 
        working;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, schools, and diverse 
        community partners in advancing the well-being of children and youth in 
        the United States;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs that partner with high-quality 
        community-based organizations build stronger communities by integrating 
        the school with the larger community;
Whereas Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool, before-
        school, summer, and expanded learning opportunities programs, held on 
        October 20, 2016, highlights the critical importance of those high-
        quality programs to children, their families, and their communities; and
Whereas nearly 2 in 5 afterschool programs report that their budgets are in 
        worse condition in 2016 than at the height of the recession in 2008, and 
        more than 3 in 5 afterschool programs report that their level of funding 
        is lower than it was in 2013, making it difficult for afterschool 
        programs across the United States to keep their doors open and their 
        lights on: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports Lights On Afterschool, a 
national celebration of afterschool programs held on October 20, 2016.
                                 <all>
