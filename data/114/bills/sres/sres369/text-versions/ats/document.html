                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            February 9, 2016

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Affirming the importance of student data privacy and recognizing 
                         Digital Learning Day.

Whereas, on February 17, 2016, Digital Learning Day is recognized;
Whereas laws must sufficiently protect the personal information of students as 
        data becomes a form of currency;
Whereas, without sufficient safeguards, student information could end up in the 
        hands of criminals or other bad actors around the world;
Whereas Digital Learning Day highlights the many ways in which technology can 
        enhance the classroom experience;
Whereas teachers and schools use technology and digital information in 
        innovative ways that benefit students;
Whereas schools use electronic records to update student information and 
        transfer electronic records from one school to another school; and
Whereas it is important to maintain student privacy and ensure the data is 
        stored safely and securely: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, By the Senate, that Congress recognizes--
            (1) the benefits of digital learning and the importance of 
        student privacy; and
            (2) that policies should safeguard student data and 
        encourage innovative educational technologies.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
