_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating October 2015 as ``Filipino American History Month''.

Whereas the earliest documented Filipino presence in the continental United 
        States was October 18, 1587, when the first ``Luzones Indios'' arrived 
        in Morro Bay, California, on board the Nuestra Senora de Esperanza, a 
        Manila-built galleon ship;
Whereas the Filipino American National Historical Society recognizes 1763 as the 
        year in which the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United 
        States was established in St. Malo, Louisiana;
Whereas the recognition of the first permanent Filipino settlement in the United 
        States adds a new perspective to United States history by bringing 
        attention to the economic, cultural, social, and other notable 
        contributions made by Filipino Americans to the development of the 
        United States;
Whereas, with a population of approximately 3,416,840 individuals, the Filipino 
        American community is the second largest Asian American and Pacific 
        Islander group in the United States;
Whereas from the Civil War to the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, Filipino 
        American servicemen and servicewomen have a longstanding history of 
        serving in the Armed Forces;
Whereas 250,000 Filipinos fought under the United States flag during World War 
        II to protect and defend the United States in the Pacific theater;
Whereas Filipino Americans continue to demonstrate a commendable sense of 
        patriotism and honor;
Whereas 9 Filipino Americans have received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the 
        highest award for valor in action against an enemy force that can be 
        bestowed on an individual serving in the Armed Forces;
Whereas the late Thelma Garcia Buchholdt, born in Claveria, Cagayan, on the 
        island of Luzon in the Philippines--

    (1) moved with her family to Alaska in 1965;

    (2) was elected to the House of Representatives of Alaska in 1974;

    (3) was the first Filipino woman elected to a State legislature; and

    (4) authored a comprehensive history book entitled ``Filipinos in 
Alaska: 1788-1958'';

Whereas Filipino American farmworkers and labor leaders such as Philip Vera Cruz 
        and Larry Itliong played an integral role in the multiethnic United Farm 
        Workers movement alongside Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and other 
        Latino workers;
Whereas Filipino Americans play an integral role in the United States healthcare 
        system as nurses, doctors, and other medical professionals;
Whereas Filipino Americans have contributed greatly to music, dance, literature, 
        education, business, journalism, sports, fashion, politics, government, 
        science, technology, the fine arts, and other fields that enrich the 
        landscape of the United States;
Whereas, as mandated in the mission statement of the Filipino American National 
        Historical Society, efforts should continue to promote the study of 
        Filipino American history and culture because the roles of Filipino 
        Americans and other people of color have largely been overlooked in the 
        writing, teaching, and learning of United States history;
Whereas it is imperative for Filipino American youth to have positive role 
        models to instill in Filipino American youth--

    (1) the significance of education, complemented by the richness of 
Filipino American ethnicity; and

    (2) the value of the Filipino American legacy; and

Whereas Filipino American History Month is celebrated during the month of 
        October 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 2015 as ``Filipino American History 
        Month'';
            (2) recognizes the celebration of Filipino American History 
        Month as--
                    (A) a study of the advancement of Filipino 
                Americans;
                    (B) a time to reflect on and remember the many 
                notable contributions that Filipino Americans have made 
                to the United States; and
                    (C) a time to renew efforts toward the research and 
                examination of history and culture so as to provide an 
                opportunity for all people of the United States--
                            (i) to learn more about Filipino Americans; 
                        and
                            (ii) to appreciate the historic 
                        contributions of Filipino Americans to the 
                        United States; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to observe 
        Filipino American History Month with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
