                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the life, legacy, and example of former Israeli Prime Minister 
        Yitzhak Rabin on the twentieth anniversary of his death.

Whereas Yitzhak Rabin was born on March 1, 1922, in Jerusalem;
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin volunteered for the Palmach, the elite unit of the 
        Haganah, the predecessor of the Israeli Defense Forces, and served for 
        27 years, including during the 1948 War of Independence, the 1956 Suez 
        War, and as Chief of Staff in the June 1967 Six Day War;
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin served as Ambassador to the United States from 1968 
        through 1973, Minister of Defense from 1984 through 1990, and Prime 
        Minister from 1974 through 1977 and from 1992 until his assassination in 
        1995;
Whereas, in 1975, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the interim agreement with 
        Egypt that laid the groundwork for the 1979 Camp David Peace Treaty 
        between Israel and Egypt;
Whereas, on September 13, 1993, in Washington, DC, Yitzhak Rabin signed the 
        Declaration of Principles framework agreement between Israel and the 
        Palestinians, also known as the Oslo Accords;
Whereas, upon the signing of the Declaration of Principles, Yitzhak Rabin said 
        to the Palestinian people: ``We say to you today in a loud and clear 
        voice: Enough of blood and tears. Enough! We harbor no hatred toward 
        you. We have no desire for revenge. We, like you, are people who want to 
        build a home, plant a tree, love, live side by side with you--in 
        dignity, empathy, as human beings, as free men.'';
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for his vision and 
        bravery as a peacemaker;
Whereas, on October 26, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein of Jordan signed a 
        peace treaty between Israel and Jordan;
Whereas, on November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated after attending a 
        peace rally in Tel Aviv, where his last words were: ``I have always 
        believed that the majority of the people want peace, are prepared to 
        take risks for peace . . . Peace is what the Jewish People aspire to.'';
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin dedicated his life to the cause of peace and security for 
        the state of Israel by defending his nation against all threats, 
        including terrorism and invasion, and undertaking courageous risks in 
        the pursuit of peace;
Whereas, in the years following Yitzhak Rabin's assassination, successive United 
        States Administrations have sought to help Israel and the Palestinians 
        achieve a negotiated two-state solution that ends their conflict;
Whereas today Israel and the Palestinian territories are the site of renewed 
        terrorism and violence;
Whereas the continuation and deepening of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in 
        the absence of progress toward a two-state solution has contributed to 
        suffering among both peoples, including being one of several factors 
        driving the current terrorism and violence in Israel and the Palestinian 
        territories; and
Whereas today, more than ever, the leadership of Yitzhak Rabin can be a model 
        for securing peace during a time of conflict: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the life and accomplishments of Yitzhak 
        Rabin and extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to his 
        family and the people of Israel on the twentieth anniversary of 
        his death;
            (2) recognizes and reiterates its continued support for the 
        close ties and special relationship between the people and 
        Governments of the United States and Israel;
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to the process of building a 
        just and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians 
        based on two states for two peoples, living side-by-side in 
        peace and security; and
            (4) calls on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to quell the 
        current outbreak of terrorism and violence, and to resume work 
        toward a negotiated two-state solution ending the conflict once 
        and for all.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
