                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 20, 2016

Mr. Tillis submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing linemen, the profession of linemen, and the contributions 
of these brave men and women who protect public safety, and expressing 
 support for the designation of April 18, 2016, as ``National Lineman 
                          Appreciation Day''.

Whereas the profession of linemen is steeped in personal, family, and 
        professional tradition;
Whereas linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic 
        events, working to make the scene safe for other public safety heroes;
Whereas linemen must work high atop power lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 
        to keep electricity flowing;
Whereas linemen play a vital role in the economy of the United States by 
        maintaining and growing the energy infrastructure of the United States;
Whereas linemen must often work under dangerous conditions while separated from 
        their families to keep schools and businesses open;
Whereas linemen put their lives on the line every day with little recognition 
        from the community regarding the danger of their work; and
Whereas April 18, 2016 would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National 
        Lineman Appreciation Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the efforts of linemen in keeping the power 
        on and protecting public safety; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``National Lineman 
        Appreciation Day''.
                                 <all>
