Supporting the goals and ideals of National Travel and Tourism Week and 
honoring the valuable contributions of travel and tourism to the United 
                                States.

Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week was established in 1983 through the

        designate the week beginning May 27, 1984, as `National Tourism Week''', 
        approved November 29, 1983 (Public Law 98-178; 97 Stat. 1126), which 
        recognized the value of travel and tourism;
Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week is celebrated across the United States 
        from May 1 through May 7, 2016;
Whereas more than 400 travel destinations throughout the United States are 
        holding events in honor of National Travel and Tourism Week;
Whereas 1 out of every 9 jobs in the United States depends on travel and tourism 
        and the travel and tourism industry supports 15,100,000 jobs in the 
        United States;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry employs individuals in all 50 States, 
        the District of Columbia, and all the territories of the United States;
Whereas international travel to the United States--

    (1) is the single largest export industry in the United States; and

    (2) generates a trade surplus balance of approximately $61,000,000,000;

Whereas the travel and tourism industry, Congress, and the President have worked 
        to streamline the visa process and make the United States welcoming to 
        visitors from other countries;
Whereas travel and tourism provide significant economic benefits to the United 
        States by generating nearly $2,100,000,000,000 in annual economic 
        output;
Whereas leisure travel allows individuals to experience the rich cultural 
        heritage and educational opportunities of the United States and its 
        communities; and
