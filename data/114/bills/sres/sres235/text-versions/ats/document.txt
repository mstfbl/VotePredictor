                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating September 2015 as ``National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas the estimated over 1,275,000 individuals in the United States who live 
        with a spinal cord injury cost society billions of dollars in health 
        care costs and lost wages;
Whereas an estimated 100,000 of those individuals are veterans who suffered a 
        spinal cord injury while serving as members of the United States Armed 
        Forces;
Whereas work-related accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries;
Whereas motor vehicle crashes are the second leading cause of spinal cord 
        injuries and traumatic brain injuries;
Whereas 70 percent of all spinal cord injuries that occur in children under the 
        age of 18 are a result of a motor vehicle accident;
Whereas every 48 minutes a person will become paralyzed, underscoring the urgent 
        need to develop new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and regeneration 
        treatments to reduce, prevent, and reverse paralysis; and
Whereas increased education and investment in research are key factors in 
        improving outcomes for victims of spinal cord injuries, improving the 
        quality of life of victims, and ultimately curing paralysis: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2015 as ``National Spinal Cord 
        Injury Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Spinal Cord 
        Injury Awareness Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better treatments 
        and therapies, and a cure for spinal cord injuries;
            (4) supports clinical trials for new therapies that offer 
        promise and hope to individuals living with paralysis; and
            (5) commends the dedication of national, regional, and 
        local organizations, researchers, doctors, volunteers, and 
        people across the United States that are working to improve the 
        quality of life of people living with spinal cord injuries and 
        their families.
