 Mr. Durbin (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Markey, Ms. Hirono, Mr.

Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Booker, Mr. Reed, and Ms.

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of June 2, 2016, as ``National 
 Gun Violence Awareness Day'' and June 2016 as ``National Gun Violence 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas, each year, more than--

    (1) 32,000 people in the United States are killed and 80,000 are 
injured by gunfire;

    (2) 11,000 people in the United States are killed in homicides 
involving firearms;

    (3) 21,000 people in the United States commit suicide by using 
firearms; and

    (4) 500 people in the United States are killed in accidental shootings;

Whereas, since 1968, more people of the United States have died from guns in the 
        United States than on the battlefields of all the wars in the history of 
        the United States;
Whereas, by 1 count in 2015 in the United States, there were--

    (1) 372 mass shooting incidents in which not fewer than 4 people were 
killed or wounded by gunfire; and

    (2) 64 incidents in which a gun was fired in a school;

Whereas gun violence typically escalates during the summer months;
Whereas, every 70 minutes, 1 person in the United States under 25 years of age 
        dies because of gun violence, and more than 6,300 such individuals die 
        annually, including Hadiya Pendleton, who, in 2013, was killed at 15 
        years of age while standing in a Chicago park; and
Whereas, on June 2, 2016, on what would have been Hadiya Pendleton's 19th 
        birthday, people across the United States will recognize National Gun 
        Violence Awareness Day and wear orange in tribute to Hadiya and other 
        victims of gun violence and their loved ones: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports--
                    (A) the designation of June 2016 as ``National Gun 
                Violence Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals of 
                that month; and
                    (B) the designation of June 2, 2016, as ``National 
                Gun Violence Awareness Day'' in remembrance of the 
                victims of gun violence; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to--
                    (A) promote greater awareness of gun violence and 
                gun safety;
                    (B) wear orange, the color that hunters wear to 
                show that they are not targets, on June 2;
                    (C) concentrate heightened attention on gun 
                violence during the summer months, when gun violence 
                typically increases; and
                    (D) bring citizens and community leaders together 
                to discuss ways to make communities safer.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
