                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the month of June 2016 as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress 
   Awareness Month'' and June 27, 2016, as ``National Post-Traumatic 
                        Stress Awareness Day''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States (in 
        this preamble referred to as the ``Armed Forces''), who proudly serve 
        the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the people 
        of the United States and deserve the investment of every possible 
        resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-
        being;
Whereas more than 2,000,000 members of the Armed Forces have deployed overseas 
        since the events of September 11, 2001, and have served in places such 
        as Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas the Armed Forces have sustained a historically high operational tempo 
        since September 11, 2001, with many members of the Armed Forces 
        deploying overseas multiple times, placing those members at high risk of 
        experiencing combat stress;
Whereas, when left untreated, exposure to traumatic combat stress can lead to 
        post-traumatic stress disorder (in this preamble referred to as 
        ``PTSD''), sometimes referred to as post-traumatic stress injury;
Whereas men and women of the Armed Forces and veterans who served before 
        September 11, 2001, remain at risk for PTSD and other mental health 
        disorders;
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs reports that, in fiscal year 2015, 
        more than 569,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 veterans who sought care at a 
        medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs received 
        treatment for PTSD;
Whereas many combat stress injuries remain unreported, undiagnosed, and 
        untreated due to a lack of awareness about post-traumatic stress and the 
        persistent stigma associated with mental health conditions;
Whereas exposure to military trauma can lead to PTSD;
Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of anxiety, depression, suicide, 
        homelessness, and drug- and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, 
        especially if left untreated;
Whereas public perceptions of PTSD or other mental health disorders create 
        unique challenges for veterans seeking employment;
Whereas the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as 
        well as the larger medical community, both private and public, have made 
        significant advances in the identification, prevention, diagnosis, and 
        treatment of PTSD and the symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain;
Whereas increased understanding of post-traumatic stress can help eliminate the 
        stigma attached to this mental health issue;
Whereas additional efforts are needed to find further ways to eliminate the 
        stigma associated with post-traumatic stress, including--

    (1) an examination of how post-traumatic stress is discussed in the 
United States; and

    (2) a recognition that post-traumatic stress is a common injury that is 
treatable and repairable;

Whereas post-traumatic stress can result from any number of stressors other than 
        combat, including rape, sexual assault, battery, torture, confinement, 
        child abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane crashes, bombings, or 
        natural disasters, and affects approximately 8,000,000 adults in the 
        United States annually; and
Whereas the designation of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month and 
        a National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Day will raise public 
        awareness about issues related to post-traumatic stress, reduce the 
        associated stigma, and help ensure that those individuals suffering from 
        the invisible wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 2016 as ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Awareness Month'' and June 27, 2016, as ``National Post-
        Traumatic Stress Awareness Day'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the entire 
        medical community, to educate members of the Armed Forces of 
        the United States, veterans, the families of members of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States and veterans, and the public 
        about the causes, symptoms, and treatment of post-traumatic 
        stress;
            (3) welcomes the efforts of the National Center for PTSD of 
        the Department of Veterans Affairs and local Vet Centers (as 
        defined in section 1712A(h) of title 38, United States Code) to 
        provide assistance to veterans who are suffering from the 
        effects of this injury;
            (4) encourages commanders of the Armed Forces of the United 
        States to support appropriate treatment of men and women of the 
        Armed Forces of the United States who are diagnosed with post-
        traumatic stress disorder; and
            (5) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 <all>
