                               RESOLUTION


 
      Recognizing the importance of cancer research and the vital 
 contributions of scientists, clinicians, cancer survivors, and other 
patient advocates across the United States who are dedicated to finding 
   a cure for cancer, and designating May 2016, as ``National Cancer 
                           Research Month''.

Whereas, in 2016, cancer remains one of the most pressing public health concerns 
        in the United States;
Whereas, in 2016, more than 1,600,000 individuals in the United States are 
        expected to be diagnosed with cancer and more than 595,000 individuals 
        in the United States are expected to die from the disease;
Whereas 1 in 2 men in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer during his 
        lifetime, and 1 in 3 women in the United States will diagnosed with 
        cancer during her lifetime;
Whereas approximately 77 percent of individuals diagnosed with cancer are over 
        55 years of age;
Whereas cancer accounts for approximately 1 in every 4 deaths, is the second 
        most common cause of disease-related death in the United States, and is 
        projected to become the number 1 disease-related killer of individuals 
        in the United States;
Whereas the incidence of cancer is expected to grow significantly, reaching 
        2,300,000 cases per year by 2030;
Whereas racial and ethnic minorities, as well as low-income, rural, and elderly 
        populations, continue to suffer disproportionately in cancer incidence, 
        prevalence, and mortality;
Whereas the term ``cancer'' refers to more than 200 diseases that collectively 
        represent--

    (1) the leading cause of death for individuals in the United States 
under 85 years of age;

    (2) the second leading cause of death for all individuals in the United 
States; and

    (3) the leading cause of disease-related death among children in the 
United States;

Whereas the most recent estimates by the National Institutes of Health indicated 
        that the overall economic costs of cancer to the United States were 
        $216,600,000,000 and the economic burden of cancer is expected to rise 
        as the number of cancer deaths increases;
Whereas the investment in cancer research by the United States has yielded 
        substantial advances in cancer research and has saved and improved 
        millions of lives;
Whereas scholars estimate that every 1 percent decline in cancer mortality saves 
        the economy of the United States $500,000,000,000;
Whereas advancements in understanding the causes, mechanisms, diagnoses, 
        treatments, and prevention of cancer have led to cures for many types of 
        cancers and have converted other types of cancers into manageable 
        chronic conditions;
Whereas, in 2011, the 5-year survival rate for all types of cancer was greater 
        than 65 percent and, in 2015, more than 14,500,000 cancer survivors 
        lived in the United States;
Whereas therapies and effective screening tools for some types of cancer remain 
        elusive and some cancers, including pancreatic, liver, lung, ovarian, 
        and brain cancers, continue to have extraordinarily high mortality rates 
        and 5-year survival rates that are typically less than 50 percent;
Whereas partnerships among research scientists, the general public, cancer 
        survivors, patient advocates, philanthropic organizations, industry, the 
        Federal Government, and State and local governments have led to advanced 
        breakthroughs, early detection tools that have increased survival rates, 
        and a better quality of life for cancer survivors;
Whereas precision medicine holds great promise in treating many forms of cancer;
Whereas almost all of what is known about cancer diagnosis, treatment, and 
        prevention comes from the 3 to 5 percent of patients who enroll in 
        clinical trials, but these trials enroll relatively homogeneous patient 
        populations, leaving a lack of evidence to guide treatments for a large 
        proportion of the other 95 to 97 percent of patients who do not 
        participate in or do not qualify for studies;
Whereas the explosion of new science, treatments, and diagnostic tests make 
        broad reaching data initiatives and breaking down organizational 
        barriers to share information more important than ever so it can be 
        determined how best to apply breakthrough treatments to the diverse 
        population of the United States; and
Whereas advances in cancer research have had significant implications for the 
        treatment of other costly diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, 
        Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, and macular degeneration: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the importance of cancer research and the 
        invaluable contributions of researchers in the United States 
        and around the world who are dedicated to reversing the cancer 
        epidemic;
            (2) designates May 2016, as ``National Cancer Research 
        Month''; and
            (3) supports efforts to--
                    (A) establish cancer research as a national and 
                international priority; and
                    (B) eliminate the more than 200 diseases that 
                collectively represent cancer.
                                 <all>
