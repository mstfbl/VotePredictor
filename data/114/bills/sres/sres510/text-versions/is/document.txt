                               RESOLUTION


 
   Affirming the importance of title IX, applauding the increase in 
educational opportunities available to women and girls, and recognizing 
the tremendous amount of work left to be done to further increase such 
                             opportunities.

Whereas 44 years ago, President Richard M. Nixon signed title IX of the 
        Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) into law (referred 
        to in this preamble as ``title IX''), and in 2002 a resolution was 
        passed establishing that such title may be cited as the ``Patsy Takemoto 
        Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act'';
Whereas title IX prohibits any educational institution that receives Federal 
        education funding from discriminating against students or employees on 
        the basis of sex;
Whereas sex discrimination includes gender-based violence, sexual harassment and 
        assault, dating violence, and domestic violence;
Whereas title IX guarantees equal educational opportunities for all students, 
        including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``LGBT'') students, pregnant or parenting students, and 
        gender nonconforming students;
Whereas since 1972, the United States has made great progress in providing 
        educational opportunities to women and girls, and in 2016 women earn the 
        majority of doctoral, master's, baccalaureate, and associate's degrees;
Whereas since 1972, the participation of women and girls in sports has increased 
        by almost 900 percent in high school and almost 500 percent in college, 
        providing women and girls with the opportunity to develop leadership and 
        teamwork skills, earn athletic scholarships to help finance a college 
        degree, and become successful professional athletes;
Whereas, despite the progress that has been made in higher education and 
        athletics, women, girls, pregnant or parenting students, LGBT 
        individuals, and gender nonconforming individuals in the United States 
        are still too often denied equal educational opportunities;
Whereas the share of baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, 
        and mathematics earned by women has decreased over the past decade, and 
        women now earn only 19 percent of engineering degrees, 18 percent of 
        computing degrees, 42 percent of mathematics degrees, and 39 percent of 
        physical science degrees, at the baccalaureate level;
Whereas women of color earn only 6 percent of computing degrees and 3 percent of 
        engineering degrees at the baccalaureate level;
Whereas women have about 64,000 fewer opportunities than men to participate in 
        college sports, and in 2015 only 37 of the 313 athletic directors in 
        Division I sports were women;
Whereas multiple studies have confirmed that 1 in 5 women are sexually assaulted 
        on college campuses and about 20 percent of girls have been the victims 
        of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault while in high school;
Whereas more than 50 percent of girls in grades 7 through 12 experience sexual 
        harassment and 10 percent of high school students experience dating 
        violence each year, which can lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety, 
        and unhealthy and antisocial behaviors, and can negatively impact 
        academic achievement;
Whereas men still hold the vast majority of school leadership positions, and 
        only about 31 percent of full professors at degree-granting 
        postsecondary institutions are women, 26 percent of college and 
        university presidents are women, and 27 percent of school district 
        superintendents are women;
Whereas pregnant and parenting students are more likely to drop out of high 
        school than other students, and only 51 percent of mothers under the age 
        of 20 earn a high school diploma by the age of 22, leading to decreased 
        opportunities for continuing education and employment; and
Whereas LGBT students face pervasive discrimination and harassment in school, on 
        college campuses, and in the workforce, impeding their ability to fully 
        access the educational opportunities they are entitled to: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) applauds the tremendous increase in educational 
        opportunities, including in sports, for women and girls since 
        the passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972;
            (2) commends the work of the Department of Education and 
        the Department of Justice to ensure that students have a safe 
        learning environment by working to ensure that schools prevent 
        and respond to discrimination and harassment on the basis of 
        sex, including sexual assault, harassment, domestic and dating 
        violence, pregnancy, sex-stereotyping, and discrimination based 
        on actual or perceived gender identity; and
            (3) recognizes that progress must still be made to secure 
        the promise of such title IX that no educational institution 
        that receives Federal education funding discriminates against 
        any person because of their sex.
                                 <all>
