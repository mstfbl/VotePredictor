                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning the horrific acts of violence and hatred in Dallas, Texas, 
   on July 7, 2016, and expressing support and prayers for all those 
                        impacted by the tragedy.

Whereas, on July 7, 2016, during a rally and march in Dallas, Texas, a lone 
        gunman opened fire, killing 5 police officers and wounding 9 other 
        officers and 2 bystanders;
Whereas this act of violence and hatred is the deadliest attack on United States 
        law enforcement officers since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
        2001;
Whereas this act of violence and hatred occurred during a lawful, peaceful, 
        nonviolent political demonstration;
Whereas this attack took place with the intention of targeting police officers;
Whereas Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel performed their 
        duties admirably during the attack and risked their lives for the safety 
        of the people of Dallas; and
Whereas the residents of Dallas came together to support the victims, and the 
        families, friends, and loved ones of the victims: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous 
        attack that occurred in Dallas, Texas, on July 7, 2016;
            (2) expresses its belief that an attack upon a police 
        officer is an affront to the rule of law and the promise of 
        justice, domestic tranquility, common defense, and general 
        welfare and the blessings of liberty secured by the 
        Constitution of the United States;
            (3) offers its condolences to the families, friends, and 
        loved ones of those who were killed while protecting the city 
        of Dallas and expresses its hope for the quick and complete 
        recovery of the survivors wounded in the shooting;
            (4) applauds the bravery and dedication exhibited by the 
        hundreds of Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
        officials, emergency medical responders, and others who offered 
        their support and assistance; and
            (5) stands together united against violence and hatred, and 
        in support of the brave and honorable police officers across 
        the United States who work every day to keep the country safe.
