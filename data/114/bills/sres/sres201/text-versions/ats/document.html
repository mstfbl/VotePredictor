                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating June 19, 2015, as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' in 
recognition of June 19, 1865, the date on which slavery legally came to 
                      an end in the United States.

Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the frontier areas of the 
        United States, in particular the State of Texas and the other 
        Southwestern States, until months after the conclusion of the Civil War, 
        more than 2 \1/2\ years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the 
        Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863;
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, 
        arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and 
        that the enslaved were free;
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 
        19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'', as inspiration 
        and encouragement for future generations;
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest have continued the tradition of 
        observing ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' for 150 years;
Whereas 43 States, the District of Columbia, and other countries have designated 
        ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' as a special day of observance in 
        recognition of the emancipation of all slaves in the United States;
Whereas ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' celebrations have been held to honor 
        African-American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect 
        for all cultures;
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves and 
        the descendants of former slaves remain an example for all people of the 
        United States, regardless of background, religion, or race;
Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the ratification of the 13th 
        Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in December 1865;
Whereas Frederick Douglass, born in the State of Maryland in 1818, escaped from 
        slavery and became a leading writer, orator, publisher, and one of the 
        most influential advocates in the United States for abolitionism and the 
        equality of all people;
Whereas Frederick Douglass was recognized for his accomplishments with a statue 
        that was unveiled during a ceremony on June 19, 2013, in Emancipation 
        Hall in the United States Capitol;
Whereas 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act 
        of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), signed into law on August 6, 1965, a 
        milestone in providing equal protections for African-Americans, 
        including former slaves and the descendants of former slaves; and
Whereas, over the course of its history, the United States has grown into a 
        symbol of democracy and freedom around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 19, 2015, as ``Juneteenth Independence 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the historical significance of ``Juneteenth 
        Independence Day'' to the United States;
            (3) supports the continued nationwide celebration of 
        ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' to provide an opportunity for 
        the people of the United States to learn more about the past 
        and to better understand the experiences that have shaped the 
        United States; and
            (4) recognizes that the observance of the end of slavery is 
        part of the history and heritage of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
