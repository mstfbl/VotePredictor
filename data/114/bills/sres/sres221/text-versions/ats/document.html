   Recognizing the 100th anniversary of Rocky Mountain National Park.

Whereas in 1909, reflecting on the beauty of what would become Rocky Mountain 
        National Park, park promoter, Enos Mills wrote, ``In years to come when 
        I am asleep beneath the pines, thousands of families will find rest and 
        hope in this park'';
Whereas on January 26, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Act 
        commonly known as the ``Rocky Mountain National Park Act'' (38 Stat. 
        798, chapter 19), which gave that land the special designation of a 
        national park and preserved the land for the enjoyment of all people of 
        the United States;
Whereas 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Rocky Mountain 
        National Park;
Whereas Rocky Mountain National Park is not only a State treasure, but a 
        national treasure that attracts more than 3,000,000 visitors each year, 
        and benefits national, State, and local economies by generating millions 
        of dollars in revenue;
Whereas Rocky Mountain National Park provides visitors with unparalleled 
        opportunities to experience hundreds of miles of hiking trails, nearly 
        150 lakes, and scenic vistas including tundra and montane ecosystems;
Whereas on March 30, 2009, 95 percent of Rocky Mountain National Park was 
        designated as wilderness and the park showcases the diverse natural 
        beauty of these rugged mountains;
Whereas Rocky Mountain National Park has an average altitude higher than any 
        other national park in the United States, with dozens of mountains 
        higher than 12,000 feet in elevation, including Longs Peak, which stands 
        at a massive 14,259 feet;
Whereas Rocky Mountain National Park remains an iconic Colorado landscape with 
        significant cultural connections to Native Americans;
Whereas Rocky Mountain National Park protects 415 square miles of diverse 
        ecosystems and is home to a wide array of wildlife, including bighorn 
        sheep, bears, beavers, marmots, moose, mountain lions, and elk;
Whereas the National Park Service will continue the long tradition of preserving 
        and protecting Rocky Mountain National Park for years to come, providing 
        access to the wilderness and wildlife within Rocky Mountain National 
        Park for generations of Americans; and
Whereas on September 4, 2015, the National Park Service intends to re-dedicate 
        Rocky Mountain National Park for the next 100 years: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates and celebrates Rocky Mountain National 
        Park on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the park;
            (2) encourages all people of Colorado and of the United 
        States to visit that unique national treasure; and
            (3) declares September 4, 2015, as Rocky Mountain National 
        Park Day.
