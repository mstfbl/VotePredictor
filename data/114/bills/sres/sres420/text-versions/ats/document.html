Whereas Augustana senior student athletes Daniel Jansen and Casey Schilling have 
        been named 2 of 13 finalists for the Bevo Francis Award, which honors 
        the player who had the best overall season within Small College 
        Basketball;
Whereas the Augustana coach, Tom Billeter, was named Coach of the Year by the 
        National Association of Basketball Coaches;
Whereas, during the 2015-2016 season, the Augustana Vikings finished with a

Whereas the presence of 3 seniors and 4 juniors on the roster of the Augustana 
        Vikings represents the commitment of those students to the university

        student athlete into the ethos of the university: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        determination, and commitment to excellence of the players, 
        parents, families, coaches, and managers of the team.
