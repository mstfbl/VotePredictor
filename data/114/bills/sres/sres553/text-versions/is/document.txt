                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate on the challenges the conflict in 
     Syria poses to long-term stability and prosperity in Lebanon.

Whereas the stability of Lebanon, a pluralistic democracy in the Middle East, is 
        in the interests of the United States and United States allies in the 
        region;
Whereas the United States has provided more than $2,000,000,000 in assistance to 
        Lebanon in the past decade, including training and equipment for the 
        Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF);
Whereas the conflict in Syria threatens stability in Lebanon as a result of 
        violent attacks against Lebanese citizens perpetrated by combatants 
        active in Syria, as well as a massive influx of refugees fleeing the 
        conflict;
Whereas the United States has contributed more than $5,500,000,000 in 
        humanitarian assistance for victims of the conflict in Syria, including 
        for refugees in Lebanon;
Whereas the people of Lebanon have shown great generosity in welcoming more than 
        1,000,000 refugees from Syria, a refugee population equal to \1/4\ of 
        its native population;
Whereas Lebanon is hosting more refugees proportionally than any nation in the 
        world;
Whereas the refugee crisis has challenged Lebanon's economy, which faces a 
        national debt that is approximately 140 percent of gross domestic 
        product and underperforming economic growth;
Whereas the LAF have been called into direct conflict with the Islamic State in 
        Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) as a result of attacks carried out by the 
        terrorist group in Lebanon;
Whereas the Syrian conflict has placed additional strains on the Government of 
        Lebanon as it continues to confront political deadlock that has kept the 
        Presidency vacant for more than two years;
Whereas the unique political constitution of Lebanon hinges on that nation's 
        distinct demographic and social equilibrium;
Whereas the prolongation of the Syrian conflict has the potential to upset the 
        precarious social and political balance in Lebanon;
Whereas the constitution of Lebanon is further undermined by undue foreign 
        influence, particularly by the Islamic Republic of Iran through its 
        terrorist proxy Hizbollah;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1701 in 2006, 
        which calls for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon and 
        stresses the importance of full control over Lebanon by the Government 
        of Lebanon; and
Whereas Hizbollah continues to violate United Nations Security Council 
        Resolution 1701, including by replenishing its stock of rockets and 
        missiles in South Lebanon: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the importance of bilateral United States 
        assistance to the Government of Lebanon in building its 
        capacity to provide services and security for Lebanese citizens 
        and curbing the influence of Hizbollah;
            (2) encourages continued coordination between the 
        Department of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees, and humanitarian organizations to ensure that 
        refugees from the conflict in Syria, including those in 
        Lebanon, are supported in such a way as to mitigate any 
        potentially adverse effect on their host countries;
            (3) recognizes that it is in the interests of the United 
        States to seek a negotiated end to the conflict in Syria that 
        includes the ultimate departure of Bashar al-Assad, which would 
        allow for the eventual return of the millions of Syrian 
        refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and other countries around 
        the world;
            (4) supports full implementation of United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 1701; and
            (5) recognizes the LAF as the sole institution entrusted 
        with the defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and supports United 
        States partnerships with the LAF, particularly through the 
        global coalition to defeat the terrorist group ISIS.
