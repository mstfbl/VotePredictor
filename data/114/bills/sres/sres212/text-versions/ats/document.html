Condemning the attack on Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 
 Charleston, South Carolina, and expressing encouragement and prayers 
                 for all affected by this evil assault.

Whereas on June 17, 2015, a horrific mass shooting took place during a Bible 
        study class at ``Mother Emanuel'', the Emanuel African Methodist 
        Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where 9 innocent lives 
        were ended in bloodshed;
Whereas the people of the United States mourn the loss to the community and to 
        our Nation of the individuals taken that night: State Senator Rev. 
        Clementa Pinckney, Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, Rev. Daniel Simmons 
        Sr., Rev. Sharonda Singleton, Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lance, 
        Tywanza Sanders, and Myra Thompson; and
Whereas the church, community, and State have come together to offer support, 
        faith, and prayers for those lost and for those who will work to soothe 
        this terrible wound and overcome the hatred and racism that led to this 
        attack: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the attack of June 17, 2015, on Emanuel 
        African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South 
        Carolina and the hate and racist bigotry that motivated it;
            (2) offers condolences to the families and loved ones of 
        those killed and to the staff and congregation of Mother 
        Emanuel; and
            (3) supports community efforts towards healing from this 
        terrible crime and nationwide efforts to overcome hatred, 
        bigotry, and violence.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
