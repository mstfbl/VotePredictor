                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate on Russian military aggression.

Whereas, on May 25, 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the 
        Agreement Between the Government of The United States of America and the 
        Government of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Prevention 
        of Incidents On and Over the High Seas (the ``Agreement''). Russia and 
        the United States remain parties to the Agreement;
Whereas Article IV of the Agreement provides that ``Commanders of aircraft of 
        the Parties shall use the greatest caution and prudence in approaching 
        aircraft and ships of the other Party operating on and over the high 
        seas, and . . . shall not permit simulated attacks by the simulated use 
        of weapons against aircraft and ships, or performance of various 
        aerobatics over ships'';
Whereas, on January 25, 2016, a Russian Su-27 air-superiority fighter flew 
        within 15 feet of a United States Air Force RC-135U aircraft flying a 
        routine patrol in international airspace over the Black Sea;
Whereas, on April 11, 2016, the USS DONALD COOK, an Arleigh-Burke-class guided-
        missile destroyer, was repeatedly buzzed by Russian Su-24 attack 
        aircraft while operating in the Baltic Sea. United States officials 
        described the low-passes as having a ``simulated attack profile'';
Whereas, on April 12, 2014, a Russian Su-24 again conducted close-range low 
        altitude passes for about 90 minutes near the DONALD COOK;
Whereas the United States European Command expressed ``deep concerns'' about the 
        April 11 and 12, 2016, Russian close-range passes over the DONALD COOK 
        and stated that the maneuvers were ``unprofessional and unsafe'';
Whereas, on April 14, 2016, a Russian Su-27 barrel-rolled over a United States 
        reconnaissance aircraft operating in international airspace over the 
        Baltic Sea, at one point coming within 50 feet of the United States 
        plane. The Pentagon condemned the maneuver as ``erratic and 
        aggressive'';
Whereas, on April 20, 2016, Russian Permanent Representative to the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Alexander Grushko accused United 
        States military aircraft and vessels operating in international waters 
        as attempting ``to exercise military pressure on Russia'' and promised 
        to ``take all necessary measures [and] precautions, to compensate for 
        these attempts to use military force'';
Whereas, on April 29, 2016, another Russian Su-27 performed another barrel-roll 
        over a United States Air Force RC-135 reconnaissance plane, this time 
        coming within approximately 100 feet of the aircraft;
Whereas the commander of the United States Cyber Command, Admiral Mike Rogers, 
        warned Congress during a Senate hearing that Russia and China can now 
        launch crippling cyberattacks on the electric grid and other critical 
        infrastructures of the United States;
Whereas Russia's military build-up and increasing Anti-Access/Area Denial 
        capabilities in Kaliningrad and its expanded operations in the Arctic, 
        the Black Sea, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and in Syria aim to deny 
        United States access to key areas of Eurasia and often pose direct 
        challenges to stated United States interests;
Whereas the United States has determined that in 2015, Russia continued to be in 
        violation of obligations under the Treaty between the United States of 
        America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination 
        of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (the ``INF 
        Treaty''), signed in Washington, DC, on December 8, 1987, and entered 
        into force June 1, 1988, not to possess, produce, or flight-test a 
        ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 
        5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles; and
Whereas General Philip Breedlove, Commander of United States European Command, 
        stated that ``we face a resurgent and aggressive Russia, and as we have 
        continued to witness these last two years, Russia continues to seek to 
        extend its influence on its periphery and beyond'': Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the recent dangerous and unprofessional 
        Russian intercepts of United States-flagged aircraft and 
        vessels;
            (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to 
        cease provocative military maneuvers that endanger United 
        States forces and those of its allies;
            (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and 
        the international community to continue to apply pressure on 
        the Government of the Russian Federation to cease its 
        provocative international behavior; and
            (4) reaffirms the right of the United States to operate 
        military aircraft and vessels in international airspace and 
        waters.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
