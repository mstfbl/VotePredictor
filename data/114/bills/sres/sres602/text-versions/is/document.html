                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the inclusion and meaningful engagement of Latinos in 
           environmental protection and conservation efforts.

Whereas Latinos are the largest ethnic group in the United States, with more 
        than 56,600,000 Latinos making up 17.6 percent of the population of the 
        United States;
Whereas the Latino community is projected to grow to nearly \1/4\ of the 
        population of the United States by 2050;
Whereas Latinos should have greater representation in the decisionmaking process 
        relating to, and management of, public land;
Whereas Latino conservation initiatives break down barriers, improve access to 
        public land, and encourage outreach to, and new opportunities for, the 
        Latino community to use public land;
Whereas Latino conservation efforts can range from outdoor activities, such as 
        hiking and kayaking, to educational activities and community gatherings;
Whereas increased access to outdoor recreation opportunities encourages Latino 
        families and youth to engage with the outdoors and demonstrate the 
        commitment of the Latino families and youth to conservation;
Whereas each person should have the opportunity to discover his or her history, 
        culture, and heritage by exploring and experiencing the public land of 
        the United States;
Whereas access to green spaces provides for healthier and more active 
        lifestyles, which helps address numerous health disparity issues facing 
        the Latino community, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular 
        disease;
Whereas the participation of Latinos in conservation efforts can encourage the 
        interest and involvement of Latinos in careers in conservation;
Whereas the people of the United States must ensure that the public land and 
        natural surroundings of the United States are protected for future 
        generations; and
Whereas the members of the largest ethnic group in the United States, as the 
        environmental stewards of tomorrow, will play a significant role in 
        securing the future success and preservation of the public land of the 
        United States, especially as that group continues to grow; Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the role of Latinos in protecting and 
        preserving the land, water, and wildlife of the United States;
            (2) supports the inclusion and meaningful engagement of 
        Latinos in environmental protection and conservation efforts; 
        and
            (3) encourages Latinos in the United States to participate 
        in ceremonies, activities, and programs that engage the 
        community in the outdoors and bring awareness to the importance 
        of conservation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
