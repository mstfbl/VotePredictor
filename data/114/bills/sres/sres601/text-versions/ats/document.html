                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 29, 2016

   Mr. Isakson (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating September 2016 as ``National Dystonia Awareness Month'' and 
    raising awareness and understanding of the disorder of dystonia.

Whereas National Dystonia Awareness Month will raise public awareness and 
        understanding of the disorder of dystonia, which has numerous 
        manifestations affecting people of all ages, races, genders, and 
        backgrounds;
Whereas National Dystonia Awareness Month will also foster understanding of the 
        impact the various forms of dystonia have on the individuals who are 
        affected and the families of those individuals;
Whereas dystonia is a neurological disorder presenting in various forms, 
        characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause abnormal and 
        often repetitive movements or postures;
Whereas symptoms of dystonia may impede the ability of an individual--

    (1) to walk, as in generalized dystonia or limb dystonia;

    (2) to control the posture of the head of the individual, as in 
cervical dystonia;

    (3) to speak, as in spasmodic dysphonia or oromandibular dystonia;

    (4) to see, as in blepharospasm; or

    (5) to write, as in hand dystonia;

Whereas there are limited treatments and no cure for dystonia;
Whereas dystonia is commonly misdiagnosed, delaying access to appropriate 
        medical care for those individuals who are affected;
Whereas countless friends, loved ones, spouses, and caregivers must shoulder the 
        physical, emotional, and financial burdens that dystonia causes;
Whereas the severity of the symptoms of dystonia and the limited public 
        awareness of the disease cause many patients to be isolated;
Whereas the dystonia community is uniting to cooperate on awareness efforts 
        throughout September of 2016; and
Whereas the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research Foundation, Dystonia, Inc., 
        the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, the National Spasmodic 
        Dysphonia Association, and the National Spasmodic Torticollis 
        Association are dedicated to--

    (1) conducting research to find treatments and a cure for dystonia;

    (2) fostering public awareness and understanding of dystonia;

    (3) educating patients and their families about dystonia to improve the 
treatment of and care for patients; and

    (4) providing support and encouraging individuals to become advocates, 
including by sponsoring annual patient education conferences, school-based 
educational programs, and local events to raise funds for dystonia 
research, education, advocacy, and awareness: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2016 as ``National Dystonia 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Dystonia 
        Awareness Month to raise public awareness and understanding of 
        dystonia;
            (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find a 
        cure for all forms of dystonia; and
            (4) encourages all people in the United States and 
        interested groups to support National Dystonia Awareness Month 
        through various appropriate ceremonies and activities--
                    (A) to promote public awareness of dystonia; and
                    (B) to foster the understanding of the impact of 
                dystonia on patients and their families.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
