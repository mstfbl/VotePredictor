                               RESOLUTION


 
 Urging the European Union to designate Hizballah in its entirety as a 
terrorist organization and to increase pressure on the organization and 
              its members to the fullest extent possible.

Whereas in July 2012, a Hizballah terror attack in Bulgaria killed 5 Israeli 
        tourists and 1 Bulgarian;
Whereas in March 2013, a Hizballah operative in Cyprus was convicted of planning 
        terror attacks after admitting that he was a member of Hizballah, had 
        been trained in the use of weapons, and used a dual Swedish-Lebanese 
        passport to travel around Europe on missions as a courier and scout for 
        Hizballah;
Whereas although that Hizballah operative was convicted on criminal-related 
        charges, authorities had to drop terrorism charges against him because 
        Hizballah was not listed as a terrorist organization;
Whereas in July 2013, the European Union (referred to in this resolution as the 
        ``EU'') designated Hizballah's so-called ``military wing'', but not the 
        organization as a whole, as a terrorist organization;
Whereas the EU designation of Hizballah's military wing has enabled substantial 
        and important cooperation between United States and European authorities 
        aimed at uncovering and thwarting Hizballah's international criminal 
        activities, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, the proceeds 
        of which are used to purchase weapons and advance Hizballah's terrorist 
        aims;
Whereas the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 
        114-102) was signed into law in December 2015, broadening financial 
        sector sanctions against Hizballah to compel foreign financial 
        institutions to refrain from supporting the terrorist group;
Whereas in February 2016, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and 
        U.S. Customs and Border Protection partnered with counterparts in 
        France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium to arrest top leaders of the 
        European cell of Hizballah's External Security Organization Business 
        Affairs Component, which engages in international money laundering and 
        drug trafficking to support Hizballah's terror activities;
Whereas for many years, Iran and Syria have been the prime sponsors of 
        Hizballah, by harboring, financing, training, and arming the terrorist 
        group;
Whereas according to the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism, 
        Iran has armed Hizballah, provided hundreds of millions of dollars in 
        support of Hizballah, and trained thousands of its fighters;
Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of approximately 150,000 missiles and 
        rockets, many of which can reach deep into Israel, at a time when 
        Hizballah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah is threatening to invade 
        Galilee or attack civilian Israeli chemical plants to generate mass 
        destruction;
Whereas while the EU confronts the migrant crisis sparked by violence in Syria, 
        6,000 to 8,000 Hizballah fighters have been on the ground in Syria 
        aiding the Assad regime in its slaughter of innocent Syrians;
Whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate security establishment of the 
        country as set forth in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 
        (2006), are struggling to control the flow of weapons and Hizballah 
        fighters at its borders;
Whereas Hizballah trains and provides weapons for armed groups in Iraq and 
        Yemen, further destabilizing the region and perpetuating violence in 
        those countries;
Whereas in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem stated 
        that Hizballah does not ``have a military wing and a political one . . . 
        Every element of Hizballah, from commanders to members as well as our 
        various capabilities, are in the service of the resistance'';
Whereas the United States, Canada, Israel, and the Netherlands have designated 
        Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist organization, while Australia 
        and New Zealand have applied the designation to the organization's 
        military wing;
Whereas in March 2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council, composed of Bahrain, 
        Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, 
        formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a terrorist organization, 
        and the League of Arab States shortly thereafter adopted the same 
        designation; and
Whereas in April 2016, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, denounced 
        Hizballah's ``terrorist acts'' in the Middle East: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses appreciation to the EU for the progress made 
        in countering Hizballah since the EU designated Hizballah's 
        military wing as a terrorist organization;
            (2) expresses support for the continued, increased 
        cooperation between the United States and the EU in thwarting 
        Hizballah's criminal and terrorist activities; and
            (3) urges the EU to designate Hizballah in its entirety as 
        a terrorist organization and increase pressure on the group, 
        including through--
                    (A) facilitating better cross-border cooperation 
                between EU members in combating Hizballah;
                    (B) issuing arrest warrants against members and 
                active supporters of Hizballah;
                    (C) freezing Hizballah's assets in Europe, 
                including those masquerading as charities; and
                    (D) prohibiting fundraising activities in support 
                of Hizballah.
