                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating December 17, 2016, as ``Wreaths Across America Day''.

Whereas, 25 years before the date of adoption of this resolution, the Wreaths 
        Across America project began with an annual tradition that occurs in 
        December, of donating, transporting, and placing 5,000 Maine balsam fir 
        remembrance wreaths on the graves of the fallen heroes buried at 
        Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas, in the 25 years preceding the date of adoption of this resolution, more 
        than 3,317,000 wreaths have been sent to locations, including national 
        cemeteries and veterans memorials, in every State and overseas;
Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project, to ``Remember, Honor, 
        Teach'', is carried out in part by coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies 
        in all 50 States and overseas, including at--

    (1) Arlington National Cemetery;

    (2) veterans cemeteries; and

    (3) other locations;

Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a week-long veterans 
        parade between Maine and Virginia, stopping along the way to spread a 
        message about the importance of--

    (1) remembering the fallen heroes of the United States;

    (2) honoring those who serve; and

    (3) reminding the people of the United States about the sacrifices made 
by veterans and their families to preserve freedoms in the United States;

Whereas, in 2015, approximately 901,000 remembrance wreaths were sent to more 
        than 1,100 locations across the United States and overseas, an increase 
        of more than 100 locations compared to the previous year;
Whereas, in December 2016, the tradition of escorting tractor-trailers filled 
        with donated wreaths from Maine to Arlington National Cemetery will be 
        continued by--

    (1) the Patriot Guard Riders; and

    (2) other patriotic escort units, including motorcycle units, law 
enforcement units, and first responder units;

Whereas hundreds of thousands of individuals volunteer each December to help lay 
        remembrance wreaths;
Whereas the trucking industry in the United States continues to support the 
        Wreaths Across America project by providing drivers, equipment, and 
        related services to assist in the transportation of wreaths across the 
        United States to over 1,200 locations;
Whereas the Senate designated December 12, 2015, as ``Wreaths Across America 
        Day''; and
Whereas, on December 17, 2016, the Wreaths Across America project will continue 
        the proud legacy of bringing remembrance wreaths to Arlington National 
        Cemetery: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates December 17, 2016, as ``Wreaths Across 
        America Day'';
            (2) honors--
                    (A) the Wreaths Across America project;
                    (B) patriotic escort units, including motorcycle 
                units, law enforcement units, and first responder 
                units;
                    (C) the trucking industry in the United States; and
                    (D) the volunteers and donors involved in this 
                worthy tradition; and
            (3) recognizes--
                    (A) the service of veterans and members of the 
                Armed Forces; and
                    (B) the sacrifices that veterans, members of the 
                Armed Forces, and their families have made, and 
                continue to make, for the United States, a great 
                Nation.
