                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting a transition to 100 percent clean, renewable energy to help 
  consumers, support the economy and national security of the United 
         States, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Whereas, in December 2016, nearly 200 nations that are parties to the United 
        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted an historic 
        international agreement to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate 
        change;
Whereas transitioning to clean energy will help reduce carbon pollution in the 
        United States, and combat climate change;
Whereas transitioning to clean energy will help the United States meet its 
        international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
Whereas transitioning to a clean energy economy will create millions of well-
        paying jobs in the United States, save consumers in the United States 
        money, and boost economic growth;
Whereas low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous people in 
        the United States are inordinately exposed to pollution from fossil 
        fuels;
Whereas distributed renewable energy and energy efficiency can provide access to 
        local jobs in cities in the United States while cleaning up 
        neighborhoods;
Whereas, in 2005, the United States had fewer than 10,000 megawatts of installed 
        wind and solar electric generating capacity;
Whereas, in 2016, the United States has more than 100,000 megawatts of installed 
        wind and solar electric generating capacity;
Whereas, in 2016, the United States is projected to add more electric generating 
        capacity from solar and wind than from any other source;
Whereas, by the end of 2016, there are projected to be--

    (1) 310,000 individuals in the United States employed in the solar 
industry; and

    (2) 88,000 individuals in the United States employed in the wind 
industry;

Whereas, by 2020, there are projected to be nearly 600,000 individuals in the 
        United States employed in the wind and solar industries;
Whereas more than \1/2\ of all new electricity capacity added in the world in 
        2015 was renewable; and
Whereas according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the United States 
        has the technical potential to generate more than 100 times the quantity 
        of electricity it consumes each year as of 2016 solely from wind, solar, 
        and other renewable resources: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports a national goal of phasing out fossil fuel 
        emissions and, by 2050, generating 100 percent of the 
        electricity consumed in the United States from clean energy 
        resources, such as solar, wind, geothermal, and other renewable 
        resources; and
            (2) supports policies to achieve that goal that will--
                    (A) create jobs for all individuals, especially in 
                communities with high rates of unemployment or 
                underemployment, and build a sustainable economy; and
                    (B) ensure universal access to clean energy for all 
                homes and businesses in the United States, including 
                for moderate- and low-income families.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
