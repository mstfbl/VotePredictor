_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating January 2016 as ``National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that is produced whenever 
        any fuel, such as natural gas, propane, gasoline, oil, kerosene, wood, 
        or charcoal, is burned;
Whereas devices that produce carbon monoxide include cars, boats, gasoline 
        engines, stoves, and heating systems, and carbon monoxide produced from 
        these sources can build up in enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces;
Whereas carbon monoxide is often referred to as the ``silent killer'' because it 
        is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonirritating, and ignoring early 
        stages of carbon monoxide poisoning may cause unconsciousness and 
        continual exposure to danger;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year 
        in the United States, carbon monoxide poisoning kills more than 400 
        individuals and sends approximately 20,000 individuals to emergency 
        rooms;
Whereas when people breathe in carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas enters the 
        bloodstream and prevents adequate intake of oxygen, which can damage 
        tissues and result in death;
Whereas individuals older than the age of 65, given common preexisting medical 
        conditions, are particularly vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning;
Whereas for most individuals who suffer from carbon monoxide poisoning, the 
        early signs of exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide include 
        mild headaches and breathlessness after moderate exercise;
Whereas sustained or increased exposure to carbon monoxide can lead to flu-like 
        symptoms, including severe headaches, dizziness, tiredness, nausea, 
        confusion, irritability, and impaired judgment, memory, and 
        coordination;
Whereas breathing in low concentrations of carbon monoxide can cause long-term 
        health damage, even after exposure to the gas ends;
Whereas most cases of carbon monoxide exposure occur during the winter months of 
        December, January, and February when oil and gas heaters are more 
        heavily in use;
Whereas, on January 5, 1996, the Burt family of Kimball, Minnesota, was poisoned 
        by carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace in the home of the Burt 
        family, resulting in--

    (1) the deaths of 15-month-old Zachary Todd Burt and 4-year-old 
Nicholas Todd Burt; and

    (2) the hospitalization of Ryan Todd Burt;

Whereas Cheryl Burt, the mother of Zachary, Nicholas, and Ryan Burt, has worked 
        to educate the public about the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, 
        including by testifying in December 2009 before the Committee on 
        Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate;
Whereas Cheryl Burt has advocated for the Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial 
        Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act, which would establish a 
        Federal grant program for State and tribal carbon monoxide poisoning 
        prevention activities;
Whereas, on January 17, 2009, Amanda J. Hansen, a junior and member of the swim 
        team at West Seneca West High School, in West Seneca, New York, passed 
        away from carbon monoxide poisoning while sleeping near a faulty 
        basement boiler during a sleepover party;
Whereas Amanda J. Hansen loved Spanish, was a member of the Spanish Honor 
        Society at West Seneca West High School, and wanted to eventually teach 
        Spanish;
Whereas Amanda J. Hansen hoped to attend college at the University of North 
        Carolina;
Whereas responding to tragedy, Ken and Kim Hansen established the Amanda Hansen 
        Foundation to honor their daughter by raising money for a scholarship 
        fund and spreading awareness about the dangers of carbon monoxide and 
        the importance of taking safety measures, such as using carbon monoxide 
        detectors in residences;
Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation works with lawmakers and local communities 
        to educate the public on the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning;
Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation raises money to purchase carbon monoxide 
        detectors for individuals who cannot afford the detectors and has given 
        away 17,000 carbon monoxide detectors;
Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation and Ken and Kim Hansen through their work 
        with the Foundation collaborate with other national organizations to 
        ensure that carbon monoxide detectors are as ubiquitous as possible;
Whereas the Hansen family fought in 2010 for the passage of ``Amanda's Law'', a 
        law that mandates the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in new 
        and existing residences with fuel-burning appliances and the replacement 
        of carbon monoxide detectors every 5 years;
Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation has paid to replace furnaces in the 
        Buffalo, New York, area with furnaces that are safer and more energy 
        efficient; and
Whereas in memory of their daughter, the Hansen family has worked tirelessly to 
        make New York and the rest of the United States a safer place: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates January 2016 as ``National 
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Awareness Month''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
