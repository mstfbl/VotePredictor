                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 16, 2016

  Mr. Heinrich (for himself and Mr. Gardner) submitted the following 
 resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural 
                               Resources

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the United States solar energy industry in its effort to 
  bring low-cost, clean, 21st-century solar technology into homes and 
                  businesses across the United States.

Whereas the solar energy industry has reached 1,000,000 solar installations 
        nationwide, a milestone that marks just the beginning of the role of 
        solar energy as a mainstream power source;
Whereas although decades elapsed before the solar energy industry reached the 
        1,000,000 installation milestone, the solar energy industry projects 
        that the solar energy industry will reach 2,000,000 installations in 
        just 2 more years;
Whereas, as of December 2015, there are over 27 gigawatts of cumulative solar 
        electric capacity operating in the United States, which is enough energy 
        to power more than 5,400,000 average homes in the United States;
Whereas, as of December 2015, the United States solar energy industry provides 
        employment opportunities for more than 208,000 solar workers in all 50 
        States and the solar energy industry is creating jobs at a rate 12 times 
        higher than the rate of employment growth in the overall economy;
Whereas the United States solar energy industry is a leading employer of 
        minorities, women, and veterans;
Whereas there are nearly 4,000 primary and secondary schools in the United 
        States with active solar energy systems, which means that more than 
        2,700,000 students in the United States attend solar schools;
Whereas the cost of solar energy has dropped by 70 percent in the last 7 years 
        and solar energy has brought billions of dollars in new investments to 
        communities across the United States;
Whereas continued decreases in cost, new financing models, and innovative 
        programs, such as community solar, have made solar power accessible to 
        millions of homeowners of many incomes and backgrounds;
Whereas grid-connected solar energy reduces carbon emissions by more than 
        31,000,000 metric tons annually;
Whereas, by 2020, solar electric capacity will quadruple in size to nearly 100 
        gigawatts and employment in the solar energy industry will more than 
        double to 420,000 workers in the United States; and
Whereas, having reached the milestone of 1,000,000 solar installations in the 
        United States, solar energy should be supported by sound policies and 
        continued private sector innovation and ingenuity that will propel the 
        United States forward to a stronger economy and well-paying jobs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the United States solar energy 
industry in its effort to bring low-cost, clean, 21st-century solar 
technology into homes and businesses across the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
