_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Expressing the sense of the Committee on Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship of the Senate relating to easing the burden of Federal 
                  tax compliance on small businesses.

Whereas American small businesses face major obstacles complying with their 
        Federal tax obligations;
Whereas the complexity of the Federal tax code unfairly penalizes small 
        businesses;
Whereas such complexity requires small business owners to spend significant 
        amounts of time, money, and resources complying with their tax 
        obligations and less time operating their business;
Whereas Congress has exacerbated these challenges for America's small businesses 
        by failing to update the tax code in a manner that properly reflects 
        current circumstances;
Whereas tax policy should also promote increased savings by American citizens to 
        be able to afford the costs of living deeper into old age;
Whereas employee stock ownership plans help small businesses offer economic 
        incentives to employees and help employees save more for their 
        retirements via investments in their employing companies;
Whereas tax policy should support small businesses in providing benefit packages 
        to their employees to be competitive with larger employers for the best 
        talent;
Whereas the successful research and development tax credit has been used to 
        incentivize private firms to invest in research and development, and 
        private investment leads to spillover effects that can have a broad 
        public good through the creation of new products, the development of new 
        processes, and the launching of new industries;
Whereas while the research and development tax credit is essential for our 
        innovators, it is not accessible to many small businesses and startups--
        per the Government Accountability Office, over half of the credit goes 
        to firms with $1,000,000,000 or more in receipts;
Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, numerous commercially 
        successful innovations originated in small, fledgling firms that could 
        not access the research and development credit;
Whereas, if Congress made the research and development tax credit more available 
        to small businesses and startups, thousands of innovative small firms 
        could claim the credit, boosting their capacity to invest in innovation 
        and job creation; and
Whereas prudent changes to the structure of the Federal tax code would ease the 
        burden of tax compliance, allowing small businesses to put more money 
        back into their business, community, and the economy: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship that the Senate should enact the following:

    TITLE IV--PROMOTION AND EXPANSION OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Promotion and Expansion of Private 
Employee Ownership Act of 2015''.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) on January 1, 1998--nearly 25 years after the Employee 
        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted and the 
        employee stock ownership plan (hereafter in this section 
        referred to as an ``ESOP'') was created--employees were first 
        permitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations pursuant to 
        the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
        188);
            (2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 
        (Public Law 105-34), Congress designed incentives to encourage 
        businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations;
            (3) since that time, several thousand companies have become 
        ESOP-owned S corporations, creating an ownership interest for 
        several million Americans in companies in every State in the 
        country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to 
        technology development to services;
            (4) while estimates show that 40 percent of working 
        Americans have no formal retirement account at all, every 
        United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S 
        corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified 
        retirement savings account;
            (5) recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned 
        S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of 
        comparable companies;
            (6) studies also show that employee-owners of S corporation 
        ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings 
        through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means to 
        retire with dignity;
            (7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) 
        and the regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the 
        Small Business Administration, a small business concern that 
        was eligible under the Small Business Act for the numerous 
        preferences of the Act is denied treatment as a small business 
        concern after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent of the 
        business, even if the number of employees, the revenue of the 
        small business concern, and the racial, gender, or other 
        criteria used under the Act to determine whether the small 
        business concern is eligible for benefits under the Act remain 
        the same, solely because of the acquisition by the ESOP; and
            (8) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve and foster 
        employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs.

SEC. 403. DEFERRAL OF TAX FOR CERTAIN SALES OF EMPLOYER STOCK TO 
              EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPONSORED BY S CORPORATION.

    (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1042(c)(1) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``domestic C 
corporation'' and inserting ``domestic corporation''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to sales after the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 404. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE.

    (a) Establishment Required.--Before the end of the 90-day period 
beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Treasury shall establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership 
Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S 
corporations.
    (b) Duties of the Office.--The S Corporation Employee Ownership 
Assistance Office shall provide--
            (1) education and outreach to inform companies and 
        individuals about the possibilities and benefits of employee 
        ownership of S corporations; and
            (2) technical assistance to assist S corporations in 
        sponsoring employee stock ownership plans.

SEC. 405. SMALL BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP.

    (a) In General.--The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 47 as section 48; and
            (2) by inserting after section 46 the following:

``SEC. 47. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section--
            ``(1) the term `ESOP' means an employee stock ownership 
        plan, as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986, as amended; and
            ``(2) the term `ESOP business concern' means a business 
        concern that was a small business concern eligible for a loan, 
        preference, or other program under this Act before the date on 
        which more than 49 percent of the business concern was acquired 
        by an ESOP.
    ``(b) Continued Eligibility.--In determining whether an ESOP 
business concern qualifies as a small business concern for purposes of 
a loan, preference, or other program under this Act, each ESOP 
participant shall be treated as directly owning his or her 
proportionate share of the stock in the ESOP business concern owned by 
the ESOP.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on January 1 of the first calendar year beginning after the date 
of the enactment of this Act.
