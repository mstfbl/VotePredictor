                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 25, 2015

    Mr. Enzi (for himself and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following 
 resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
                          Labor, and Pensions

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the designation of March 2015, as ``National Colorectal 
                       Cancer Awareness Month''.

Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men 
        and women combined in the United States;
Whereas in 2015, more than 130,000 individuals in the United States will be 
        diagnosed with colorectal cancer and approximately 50,000 more will die 
        from it;
Whereas colorectal cancer is 1 of the most preventable forms of cancer because 
        screening tests can find polyps that can be removed before becoming 
        cancerous;
Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, which is when 
        treatment works best;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that if every 
        individual aged 50 or older had regular screening tests, as many as 60 
        percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized colorectal cancer 
        is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses occur at that stage;
Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce the incidence of 
        colorectal cancer and mortality, but 1 in 3 adults between the ages of 
        50 and 75 are not up to date with recommended colorectal cancer 
        screening;
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on colorectal cancer 
        prevention, screening, and symptoms are held during the month of March 
        each year; and
Whereas educational efforts can help provide to the public information on 
        methods of prevention and screening, as well as symptoms for early 
        detection: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of March 2015 as ``National 
        Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals of 
        that month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the month with appropriate awareness and educational 
        activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
