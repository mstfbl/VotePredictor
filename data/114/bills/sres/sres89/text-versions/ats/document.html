    Congratulating the Oregon Shakespeare Festival on its 80th year.

Whereas 2015 marks the 80th anniversary of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a 
        major theater arts organization in Ashland, Oregon, founded by Angus L. 
        Bowmer in 1935;
Whereas the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is one of the oldest and largest 
        professional nonprofit theaters in the United States;
Whereas Samuel Johnson wrote that William Shakespeare is ``above all writers, at 
        least above all modern writers . . . the poet that holds up to his 
        readers a faithful mirror of manners and of life'';
Whereas William Shakespeare has had an extraordinary impact on culture and 
        politics in the United States, including in the Senate;
Whereas the Tony Award-winning Oregon Shakespeare Festival includes performances 
        not only of the works of Shakespeare but also of the works of classic 
        and contemporary playwrights;
Whereas since its founding, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival has presented, on 
        its Ashland, Oregon stages, 29,300 performances to more than 15,000,000 
        audience members;
Whereas the Oregon Shakespeare Festival serves as a cornerstone of the economy 
        of southwest Oregon and the entire Pacific Northwest, providing jobs for 
        more than 500 individuals and nearly 700 volunteers and attracting 
        tourists throughout the United States and the world; and
Whereas the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is committed to the inclusion of diverse 
        people, ideas, cultures, and traditions: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Oregon Shakespeare Festival on its 
        80th year;
            (2) recognizes and commends the cultural, economic, and 
        social value provided by the work of the Oregon Shakespeare 
        Festival; and
            (3) expresses support for the continued success of the 
        Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
