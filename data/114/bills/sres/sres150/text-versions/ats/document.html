                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate about the importance of effective 
   civic and government education programs in schools in the United 
                                States.

Whereas civic and government education is essential to the preservation and 
        improvement of the constitutional government of the United States;
Whereas civic and government education programs foster understanding of the 
        history and principles of the constitutional government of the United 
        States, including principles that are embodied in certain fundamental 
        documents and speeches, such as the Declaration of Independence, the 
        Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, the Federalist 
        Papers, the Gettysburg Address, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ``I 
        Have a Dream'' speech;
Whereas research shows that too few people in the United States understand basic 
        principles of the constitutional government of the United States, such 
        as the natural rights set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the 
        existence and functions of the 3 branches of the Federal Government, 
        checks and balances, and other concepts fundamental to informed 
        citizenship;
Whereas, since the founding of the United States, schools in the United States 
        have had a strong civic mission to prepare students to be informed, 
        rational, humane, and involved citizens who are committed to the values 
        and principles of the constitutional government of the United States;
Whereas a free society relies on the knowledge, skills, and virtue of the 
        citizens of the society, particularly the individuals elected to public 
        office to represent the citizens;
Whereas, while many institutions help to develop the knowledge and skills and 
        shape the civic character of people in the United States, schools in the 
        United States, including elementary schools, bear a special and historic 
        responsibility for the development of civic competence and civic 
        responsibility of students;
Whereas student learning is enhanced by well-designed classroom civic and 
        government education programs that--

    (1) incorporate instruction in government, history, law, and democracy;

    (2) promote discussion of current events and controversial issues;

    (3) link community service and the formal curriculum; and

    (4) encourage students to participate in simulations of democratic 
processes; and

Whereas research shows that the knowledge and expertise of teachers are among 
        the most important factors in increasing student achievement: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) civic and government education is essential to the 
        well-being of the constitutional government of the United 
        States;
            (2) comprehensive and formal instruction in civic and 
        government education would provide students a basis for 
        understanding the rights and responsibilities of citizens in 
        the constitutional government of the United States;
            (3) elementary and secondary schools in the United States 
        are encouraged to offer courses on the history and theories of 
        the constitutional government of the United States, using 
        programs and curricula with a demonstrated effectiveness in 
        fostering civic competence, civic responsibility, and a 
        reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles 
        underlying the constitutional government of the United States; 
        and
            (4) all teachers of civics and government are well served 
        by having access to adequate opportunities to enrich teaching 
        through professional development programs that enhance the 
        capacity of teachers to provide effective civic and government 
        education in the classroom.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
