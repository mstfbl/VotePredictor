 Recognizing the importance of the United States-Japan relationship to 
      safeguarding global security, prosperity, and human rights.

Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is a cornerstone of global peace and 
        stability and underscores the past, present, and future United States 
        commitment to the stability and prosperity of Japan and the Asia-Pacific 
        region;
Whereas the United States and Japan established diplomatic relations on March 
        31, 1854, with the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Amity;
Whereas 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, a conflict 
        where the United States and Japan were enemies, and the strength of the 
        alliance is a testament to the ability of great nations to overcome the 
        past and to work together to create a more secure and prosperous future;
Whereas January 19, 2015, marked the 55th anniversary of the signing of the 
        Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and 
        Japan;
Whereas the United States and Japan are both free societies committed to the 
        principles of inclusive democracy, respect for human potential and 
        individual character, and the belief that the peaceful spread of these 
        principles will result in a safer and brighter future for all of 
        mankind;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and Japan can help 
        realize this future through further strengthening their economic, 
        political, social, cultural, and security relationship;
Whereas the United States and Japan are indispensable partners in tackling 
        global challenges, and have pledged significant support for efforts to 
        counter violent extremism, including the threat of ISIL; combat the 
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; prevent piracy; improve 
        global health; promote human rights; contribute to economic development 
        around the world; and assist the victims of conflict and disaster 
        worldwide;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and Japan share a 
        commitment to free and open markets, high standards for the free flow of 
        commerce and trade, and the establishment of an inclusive architecture 
        for regional and global trade and development;
Whereas Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also reiterated that his cabinet will 
        uphold the stance on the recognition of history of previous prime 
        ministers, including the Murayama statement;
Whereas the United States-Japan security alliance has evolved considerably over 
        many decades and will continue to transform as a partnership, sharing 
        greater responsibilities, dedicated to ensuring a secure and prosperous 
        region and world;
Whereas the Government of Japan has reinterpreted its constitution to allow for 
        the collective self-defense of its allies, including the United States, 
        an action that strengthens the alliance's ability to defend Japan and to 
        continue to safeguard regional security;
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is essential for ensuring maritime 
        security and freedom of navigation, commerce, and overflight in the 
        waters of the East China Sea;
Whereas Japan stands as a strong partner of the United States in efforts to 
        uphold respect for the rule of law and to oppose the use of coercion, 
        intimidation, or force to change the regional or global status quo, 
        including in the East and South China Seas, which are among the busiest 
        waterways in the world;
Whereas the United States and Japan are committed to working together towards a 
        world where the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) does not 
        threaten global peace and security with its weapons of mass destruction 
        and illicit activities, and where the DPRK respects human rights and 
        people can live in freedom;
Whereas the United States and Japan have a long history of successful technical 
        cooperation and joint scientific research and development;
Whereas, on May 7, 1843, the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United 
        States, and Japanese-Americans have made significant contributions to 
        the advancement, including our former colleague, the late Senator Daniel 
        Inouye, of the United States;
Whereas people-to-people ties between the United States and Japan are long-
        standing and deep, as exemplified by the gift of the beautiful cherry 
        trees which dot our nation's capital from the People of Japan to the 
        People of the United States in 1912, signifying an unbreakable bond 
        between the two nations; and
Whereas, on April 29, 2015, Prime Minister Abe will address a Joint Meeting of 
        Congress at the invitation of the Speaker of the House: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved,

            (1) reaffirms the importance of the United States-Japan 
        alliance for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-
        Pacific region and beyond, including through United States 
        extended deterrence, the revision of the Guidelines for United 
        States-Japan Defense Cooperation, and Japan's policy of 
        ``Proactive Contribution to Peace'' based on the principles of 
        international cooperation;

            (4) recognizes that although the United States Government 
        does not take a position on the ultimate sovereignty of the

        under the administration of Japan and opposes any unilateral 
        actions that would seek to undermine such administration;
            (5) reaffirms that the unilateral actions of a third party 
        will not affect the United States acknowledgment of the 
        administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands and that the 
        United States remains committed under the Treaty of Mutual 
        Cooperation and Security to respond to any armed attack in the 
        territories under the administration of Japan;

        people everywhere;
            (7) supports the expansion of academic and cultural 
        exchanges between the United States and Japan, especially 
        efforts to encourage Japanese students to study at universities 
        in the United States, and vice versa, to deepen people-to-
        people ties;
            (8) encourages the expansion of scientific research and 
        development and technical cooperation with Japan, to address 
        global challenges;
            (9) promotes deepening the economic and trade ties between 
        the United States and Japan, including the empowerment of 
        women, which is vital for the prosperity of both our nations, 
        the Asia Pacific region, and the world; and
            (10) calls for continued cooperation between the 
        Governments of the United States and Japan in the promotion of 
        human rights.
