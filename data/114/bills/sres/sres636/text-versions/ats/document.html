                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

            December 10 (legislative day, December 9), 2016

  Mr. Alexander (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week of December 4 through December 10, 2016, as 
             ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week''.

Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit, community-based health care 
        sites that offer primary care and wellness services based on the nursing 
        model;
Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, promotion, and optimization 
        of health, the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and 
        the diagnosis and treatment of illness;
Whereas an advanced practice nurse leads each nurse-managed health clinic, and 
        an interdisciplinary team of highly qualified health care professionals 
        staffs each nurse-managed health clinic;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of services, including 
        treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, routine physical exams, 
        immunizations for adults and children, disease screenings, health 
        education, prenatal care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;
Whereas, as of September 2016, approximately 500 nurse-managed health clinics 
        provided care across the United States and recorded more than 2,500,000 
        patient encounters annually;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health care safety net by 
        expanding access to primary care and chronic disease management services 
        for vulnerable and medically underserved populations in diverse rural, 
        urban, and suburban communities;
Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health clinics experience high 
        patient retention and patient satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed 
        health clinic patients, compared to patients of other similar safety net 
        providers, experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower 
        hospitalization rates;
Whereas the 2013 Health Affairs article ``Nurse-Managed Health Centers and 
        Patient-Homes Could Mitigate Expected Primary Care Physician Shortage'' 
        highlights the ability of nurse-managed health clinics to bring high 
        quality care to individuals who may not otherwise receive needed 
        services; and
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary care and wellness 
        services provide quality care in a cost-effective manner: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of December 4 through December 10, 
        2016, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';
            (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed 
        Health Clinic Week; and
            (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health 
        clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to 
        serve as health care workforce development sites for the next 
        generation of primary care providers.
