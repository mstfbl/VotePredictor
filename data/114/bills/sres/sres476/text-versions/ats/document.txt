                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 25, 2016

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the month of May 2016 as ``Cystic Fibrosis Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas cystic fibrosis (in this preamble referred to as ``CF'') is a genetic 
        disease affecting more than 30,000 children and adults in the United 
        States and more than 70,000 children and adults worldwide;
Whereas, in patients with CF, a defective gene causes the body to produce an 
        abnormally thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs, produces life-
        threatening lung infections, and obstructs the pancreas, preventing 
        digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines to help break down and 
        absorb food;
Whereas there are approximately 1,000 new cases of CF diagnosed each year;
Whereas infant blood screening to detect genetic defects is the most reliable 
        and least costly method to identify individuals likely to have 1 of 
        1,800 different CF mutations;
Whereas early diagnosis of CF permits early treatment and enhances quality of 
        life, longevity, and the treatment of CF;
Whereas CF impacts the families of patients because of the intense daily disease 
        management protocols that patients must endure;
Whereas, in the United States, there are more than 120 CF care centers and 55 
        affiliate programs with highly trained and dedicated providers that 
        specialize in delivering high-quality, coordinated care for CF patients 
        and their families;
Whereas the number of adults with CF has steadily grown and the median age of 
        survival for a person with CF is now nearly 40 years of age; and
Whereas innovative precision medicines and treatments have greatly improved and 
        extended the lives of patients: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of May 2016 as ``Cystic Fibrosis 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) congratulates the community of individuals who care for 
        patients with cystic fibrosis for their unrelenting dedication 
        to those patients;
            (3) recognizes that the care delivery system for cystic 
        fibrosis can be a model for building better care coordination 
        in the larger healthcare system;
            (4) acknowledges the tremendous investments and scientific 
        achievements that have significantly improved the lives of 
        individuals with cystic fibrosis; and
            (5) urges researchers, developers, patients, and providers 
        to work together closely to find a cure for this deadly 
        disease.
