                           September 26, 2016

                               RESOLUTION


 
Calling on Congress, schools, and State and local educational agencies 
to recognize the significant educational implications of dyslexia that 
 must be addressed and designating October 2016 as ``National Dyslexia 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas dyslexia is--

    (1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual 
who has the intelligence to be a much better reader; and

    (2) most commonly due to a difficulty in phonological processing (the 
appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects 
the ability of an individual to speak, read, spell, and often, learn a 
second language;

Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and affects 80 percent 
        to 90 percent of all individuals with a learning disability;
Whereas dyslexia is highly prevalent, affecting as many as 1 out of 5 
        individuals, and persistent;
Whereas dyslexia is a paradox such that an individual with dyslexia may have--

    (1) weaknesses in decoding that results in difficulties in accurate or 
fluent word recognition; and

    (2) strengths in higher-level cognitive functions, such as reasoning, 
critical thinking, concept formation, or problem solving;

Whereas great progress has been made in understanding dyslexia on a scientific 
        level, including the epidemiology and cognitive and neurobiological 
        bases of dyslexia; and
Whereas early diagnosis of dyslexia is critical for ensuring that individuals 
        with dyslexia receive focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to 
        the promotion of self-awareness and self-empowerment and the provision 
        of necessary accommodations so as to ensure school and life success: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) calls on Congress, schools, and State and local 
        educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has significant 
        educational implications that must be addressed; and
            (2) designates October 2016 as ``National Dyslexia 
        Awareness Month''.
                                 <all>
