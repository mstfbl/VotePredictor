_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Alaska State Troopers.

Whereas the 15th Alaska Territorial Legislature established the Territory of 
        Alaska Highway Patrol in 1941 for the purpose of enforcing traffic codes 
        in the Territory of Alaska;
Whereas the jurisdiction of the Alaska Highway Patrol was expanded in 1945 in 
        response to the need for a full spectrum police agency in the Territory 
        of Alaska to address crimes outside the jurisdiction of local police 
        departments;
Whereas the Alaska Territorial Legislature created the Alaska Territorial Police 
        in 1953, which became the Alaska State Police on the admission of Alaska 
        to statehood;
Whereas the Alaska State Police was renamed the Alaska State Troopers in 1967;
Whereas, in 1972, Governor of Alaska Bill Egan assigned responsibility and 
        authority for the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of 
        Alaska to the Department of Public Safety, leading to the formation of 
        the Alaska Wildlife Troopers, which is part of the Alaska State 
        Troopers;
Whereas Alaska is \1/5\ the size of the contiguous 48 States, consisting of--

    (1) 586,412 square miles of diverse terrain;

    (2) more than 3,000 rivers;

    (3) approximately 34,000 miles of coastline; and

    (4) over 200 communities, many of which are not connected to each other 
by a road;

Whereas the daily responses to requests for law enforcement assistance presents 
        unique challenges in Alaska seldom experienced in other States;
Whereas through the use of airplanes, boats, snowmachines, helicopters, and all-
        terrain vehicles, the Alaska State Troopers are able to respond across 
        vast areas of the Alaska wilderness, battling the extremes of climate 
        and terrain, to ensure that each Alaskan receives an answer to a call 
        for help;
Whereas from the urban centers of Anchorage and Fairbanks to the small, isolated 
        villages on the vast river systems in Alaska, the challenges of ensuring 
        an effective law enforcement presence in Alaska are unequaled anywhere 
        in the world;
Whereas the Alaska State Troopers partners with tribal organizations throughout 
        Alaska to sponsor the Village Public Safety Officer program, which 
        provides law enforcement, fire suppression, emergency medical, and 
        search and rescue services to remote Alaska Native villages throughout 
        the State of Alaska;
Whereas the motto of the Alaska State Troopers is ``Loyalty, Integrity, Courage, 
        Compassion, Leadership, and Accountability'';
Whereas the approximately 390 commissioned officers and 147 civilian personnel 
        of the Alaska State Troopers have met the challenge of policing Alaska 
        through their dedication, professionalism, and innovation; and
Whereas 16 members of the Alaska State Troopers and predecessor agencies of the 
        Alaska State Troopers and 2 Village Public Safety Officers have given 
        their lives in the line of duty: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Alaska State Troopers on its 75th 
        anniversary; and
            (2) expresses appreciation to the commissioned officers and 
        civilian personnel of the Alaska State Troopers and to the 
        Village Public Safety Officers, who are the ``first responders 
        of the last frontier'', and to their families, for their 
        service and sacrifice.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
