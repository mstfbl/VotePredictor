                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging additional sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of 
                     Korea, and for other purposes.

Whereas the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) tested nuclear weapons 
        on three separate occasions, in October 2006, in May 2009, and in 
        February 2013;
Whereas nuclear experts have reported that the DPRK may currently have as many 
        as 20 nuclear warheads and has the potential to possess as many as 100 
        warheads within the next 5 years;
Whereas, according to the 2014 Department of Defense (DoD) report, ``Military 
        and Security Developments Involving the Democratic People's Republic of 
        Korea'', the DPRK has proliferated nuclear technology to Libya via the 
        proliferation network of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan;
Whereas, according to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea also provided Syria 
        with nuclear reactor technology until 2007.'';
Whereas, on September 6, 2007, as part of ``Operation Orchard'', the Israeli Air 
        Force destroyed the suspected nuclear facility in Syria;
Whereas, according to the 2014 DoD report, ``North Korea has exported 
        conventional and ballistic missile-related equipment, components, 
        materials, and technical assistance to countries in Africa, Asia, and 
        the Middle East.'';
Whereas, on November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted explosive devices onboard 
        Korean Air flight 858, which killed all 115 passengers and crew on 
        board;
Whereas, on March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank the South Korean 
        warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew;
Whereas, on November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, 
        killing 4 South Korean citizens;
Whereas, on February 7, 2014, the United Nations ``Commission of Inquiry on 
        human rights in DPRK (`Commission of Inquiry')'' released a report 
        detailing the atrocious human rights record of the DPRK;
Whereas Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission, stated on March 17, 2014, 
        ``The Commission of Inquiry has found systematic, widespread, and grave 
        human rights violations occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of 
        Korea. It has also found a disturbing array of crimes against humanity. 
        These crimes are committed against inmates of political and other prison 
        camps; against starving populations; against religious believers; 
        against persons who try to flee the country--including those forcibly 
        repatriated by China.'';
Whereas Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise from policies 
        established at the highest level of the State. They have been committed, 
        and continue to take place in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
        because the policies, institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at 
        their heart remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and nature of 
        the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a 
        totalitarian State that does not have any parallel in the contemporary 
        world.'';
Whereas the Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, the Democratic 
        People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the systematic abduction, 
        denial of repatriation, and subsequent enforced disappearance of persons 
        from other countries on a large scale and as a matter of State policy. 
        Well over 200,000 persons, including children, who were brought from 
        other countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea may have 
        become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and states that the DPRK has 
        failed to account or address this injustice in any way;
Whereas, according to reports and analysis from organizations such as the 
        International Network for the Human Rights of North Korean Overseas 
        Labor, the Korea Policy Research Center, NK Watch, the Asan Institute 
        for Policy Studies, the Center for International and Strategic Studies 
        (CSIS), and the George W. Bush Institute, there may currently be as many 
        as 100,000 North Korean overseas laborers in various nations around the 
        world;
Whereas these forced North Korean laborers are often subjected to harsh working 
        conditions under the direct supervision of DPRK officials, and their 
        salaries contribute to anywhere from $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year 
        to the DPRK state coffers;
Whereas, according to the Director of National Intelligence's (DNI) 2015 
        Worldwide Threat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile 
        programs pose a serious threat to the United States and to the security 
        environment in East Asia.'';
Whereas the 2015 DNI report states, ``North Korea has also expanded the size and 
        sophistication of its ballistic missile forces, ranging from close-range 
        ballistic missiles to ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test launches. 
        In 2014, North Korea launched an unprecedented number of ballistic 
        missiles.'';
Whereas, on December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
        declared that the DPRK was responsible for a cyberattack on Sony 
        Pictures conducted on November 24, 2014;
Whereas, from 1998 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the United States 
        Government as a state sponsor of terrorism;
Whereas the DPRK is currently in violation of United Nations Security Council 
        Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 
        (2013);
Whereas the DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the United States and the 
        other so-called Six-Party Talks partners (the Republic of Korea, Japan, 
        the Russian Federation, and the People's Republic of China) designed to 
        halt its nuclear weapons program, while receiving significant 
        concessions, including fuel, oil, and food aid;
Whereas the Six Party talks have not been held since December 2008; and
Whereas, on May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-fired a ballistic 
        missile from a submarine: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) finds that the DPRK represents a serious threat to the 
        national security of the United States and United States allies 
        in East Asia and to international peace and stability, and 
        grossly violates the human rights of its own people;
            (2) urges the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the 
        Treasury to impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, 
        including targeting its financial assets around the world, 
        specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a 
        redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and
            (3) warns the President against resuming the negotiations 
        with the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six Party 
        talks, without strict pre-conditions, including that the DPRK--
                    (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments 
                outlined in the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party 
                talks;
                    (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile 
                programs and its proliferation activities;
                    (C) cease military provocations; and
                    (D) measurably and significantly improve its human 
                rights record.
                                 <all>
