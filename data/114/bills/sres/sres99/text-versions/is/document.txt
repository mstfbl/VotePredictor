                               RESOLUTION


 
Calling on the Government of Iran to fulfill its promises of assistance 
in the case of Robert Levinson, the longest held United States civilian 
                        in our Nation's history.

Whereas United States citizen Robert Levinson is a retired agent of the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a resident of Coral Springs, Florida, the 
        husband of Christine Levinson, and father of their seven children;
Whereas Robert Levinson traveled from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Kish 
        Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007;
Whereas, after traveling to Kish Island and checking into the Hotel Maryam, 
        Robert Levinson disappeared on March 9, 2007;
Whereas, in December 2007, Robert Levinson's wife, Christine, traveled to Kish 
        Island to retrace Mr. Levinson's steps and met with officials of the 
        Government of Iran who pledged to help in the investigation;
Whereas, for more than eight years, the United States Government has continually 
        pressed the Government of Iran to provide any information on the 
        whereabouts of Robert Levinson and to help ensure his prompt and safe 
        return to his family;
Whereas officials of the Government of Iran promised their continued assistance 
        to the relatives of Robert Levinson during the visit of the family to 
        the Islamic Republic of Iran in December 2007;
Whereas, in November 2010, the Levinson family received a video of Mr. Levinson 
        in captivity, representing the first proof of life since his 
        disappearance and providing some initial indications that he was being 
        held somewhere in southwest Asia;
Whereas, in April 2011, the Levinson family received a series of pictures of Mr. 
        Levinson, which provided further indications that he was being held 
        somewhere in southwest Asia;
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry stated on August 28, 2013, ``The United 
        States respectfully asks the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
        to work cooperatively with us in our efforts to help U.S. citizen Robert 
        Levinson.'';
Whereas, on September 28, 2013, during the first direct phone conversation 
        between the leaders of the United States and Iran since 1979, President 
        Barack Obama raised the case of Robert Levinson to President of Iran 
        Hassan Rouhani and urged the President of Iran to help locate Mr. 
        Levinson and reunite him with his family;
Whereas, on August 29, 2014, Secretary of State Kerry again stated that the 
        United States ``respectfully request the Government of the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran work cooperatively with us to find Mr. Levinson and 
        bring him home'';
Whereas the United States Government is currently engaged in regular, direct 
        negotiations with the Government of Iran over its nuclear program;
Whereas March 9, 2015, marks the 2,922nd day since Mr. Levinson's disappearance, 
        and he is now the longest held United States civilian in our Nation's 
        history; and
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation has announced a $5,000,000 reward 
        for information leading to Mr. Levinson's safe return: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes that Robert Levinson is the longest held 
        United States civilian in our Nation's history;
            (2) notes the pledges by current officials of the 
        Government of Iran to provide their Government's assistance in 
        the case of Robert Levinson;
            (3) urges the Government of Iran, as a humanitarian 
        gesture, to intensify its cooperation on the case of Robert 
        Levinson and to immediately share the results of its 
        investigation into the disappearance of Robert Levinson with 
        the United States Government;
            (4) urges the President and the allies of the United States 
        to continue to raise with officials of the Government of Iran 
        the case of Robert Levinson at every opportunity, 
        notwithstanding serious disagreements the United States 
        Government has with the Government of Iran on a broad array of 
        issues, including human rights, the nuclear program of Iran, 
        the Middle East peace process, regional stability, and 
        international terrorism; and
            (5) expresses sympathy to the family of Robert Levinson for 
        their anguish and expresses hope that their ordeal can be 
        brought to an end in the near future.
