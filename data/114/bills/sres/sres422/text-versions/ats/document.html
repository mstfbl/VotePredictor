                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the mission and goals of 2016 ``National Crime Victims' 
Rights Week'', which include increasing public awareness of the rights, 
   needs, concerns of, and services available to assist victims and 
                survivors of crime in the United States.

Whereas individuals in the United States are the victims of more than 20,000,000 
        crimes each year;
Whereas crime can touch the lives of anyone, irrespective of age, race, national 
        origin, religion, or gender;
Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, 
        families, schools, and communities by--

    (1) protecting the rights of crime victims and survivors; and

    (2) ensuring that resources and services are available to help rebuild 
the lives of the victims and survivors;

Whereas, as of 2008, the most conservative estimate for the economic cost of 
        violent and property crimes in the United States was $17,000,000,000 per 
        year;
Whereas that economic cost does not account for the struggle of a crime victim 
        to be made whole or losses that result from being the victim of a crime, 
        including losses of psychological, emotional, and physical well-being;
Whereas despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 and 2016 in increasing 
        the rights of, and services available to, crime victims and survivors 
        and the families of the victims and survivors, many challenges remain to 
        ensure that all crime victims and survivors and the families of the 
        victims and survivors are--

    (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;

    (2) offered support and services, regardless of whether the victims and 
survivors report crimes committed against them; and

    (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, juvenile, 
Federal, and tribal justice systems in the United States when the victims 
and survivors report crimes;

Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States and the families of the 
        victims and survivors need and deserve support and assistance to help 
        cope with the often devastating consequences of crime;
Whereas, during each year beginning in 1984 through 2015, communities across the 
        United States joined Congress and the Department of Justice in 
        commemorating ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week'' to celebrate a 
        shared vision of a comprehensive and collaborative response that 
        identifies and addresses the many needs of crime victims and survivors 
        and the families of the victims and survivors;
Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a renewed commitment to 
        serve all victims and survivors of crime in the 21st century;
Whereas the theme of 2016 ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week'', celebrated 
        during the week of April 10 through April 16, 2016, is ``Serving 
        Victims; Building Trust; Restoring Hope'' and highlights the 
        collaborative and multifaceted effort to provide comprehensive and 
        quality support to survivors;
Whereas engaging communities in victim assistance is essential to promoting 
        individual and public safety;
Whereas the United States must empower crime victims and survivors by--

    (1) protecting the legal rights of the victims and survivors; and

    (2) providing the victims and survivors with services to help them in 
the aftermath of crime; and

Whereas the people of the United States recognize and appreciate the continued 
        importance of--

    (1) promoting the rights of and services for crime victims and 
survivors; and

    (2) honoring crime victims and survivors and individuals who provide 
services for the victims and survivors: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the mission and goals of 2016 ``National Crime 
        Victims' Rights Week'', which include increasing individual and 
        public awareness of--
                    (A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors 
                and the families of the victims and survivors;
                    (B) the challenges to achieving justice for victims 
                and survivors of crime and the families of the victims 
                and survivors; and
                    (C) the many solutions to meet those challenges; 
                and
            (2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors and the 
        families of the victims and survivors should be treated with 
        dignity, fairness, and respect.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
