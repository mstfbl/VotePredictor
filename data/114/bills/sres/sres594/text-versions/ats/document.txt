                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of the third Saturday in October 
   2016 as ``National Animal Rescue Day'' to create awareness of and 
educate individuals on the importance of adoption of animals, to create 
  a humane environment for any pet, and to encourage animal adoptions 
                     throughout the United States.

Whereas between 7,000,000 and 8,000,000 companion animals are placed into 
        animals shelters each year;
Whereas between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000 companion animals are euthanized each 
        year;
Whereas a greater awareness of dog fighting and abuse encourages individuals to 
        rehabilitate animals that would otherwise be put to sleep or left in 
        animal shelters or rescues;
Whereas there are more than 13,000 animal shelters throughout the United States 
        in need of pet supplies, medical supplies, blankets, towels, cleaning 
        supplies, food, educational materials about owning a pet, and 
        information on how to screen out unqualified applicants and to provide 
        the best pet match for a family;
Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue programs throughout 
        the United States will significantly reduce the number of cats and dogs 
        that are euthanized and animals that have been rescued that are left in 
        animal shelters;
Whereas ``National Animal Rescue Day'' will alleviate the problem of pet 
        overpopulation, provide animals with good homes, and create awareness 
        of, and financial and educational resources to alleviate, the problems 
        animal shelters face each day;
Whereas ``National Animal Rescue Day'' will encourage individuals to make their 
        homes available for animals in need; and
Whereas the third Saturday in October 2016 would be an appropriate day to 
        designate as ``National Animal Rescue Day'', to be commemorated with 
        appropriate events that will increase the number of pet adoptions: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of ``National 
Animal Rescue Day''--
            (1) to create awareness of animal rescue programs 
        throughout the year; and
            (2) to be commemorated with appropriate events that will 
        increase the number of pet adoptions.
                                 <all>
