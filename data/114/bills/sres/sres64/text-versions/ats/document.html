Designating February 2 through 6, 2015, as ``National School Counseling 
                                Week''.

Whereas the American School Counselor Association has designated February 2 
        through 6, 2015, as ``National School Counseling Week'';
Whereas school counselors have long advocated for equal opportunities for all 
        students;
Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded students by guiding students 
        through academic, personal, social, and career development;
Whereas personal and social growth results in increased academic achievement;
Whereas school counselors play a vital role in ensuring that students are ready 
        for college and careers;
Whereas school counselors play a vital role in making students aware of 
        opportunities for financial aid and college scholarships;
Whereas school counselors assist with and coordinate efforts to foster a 
        positive school climate, resulting in a safer learning environment for 
        all students;
Whereas school counselors have been instrumental in helping students, teachers, 
        and parents deal with personal trauma as well as tragedies in their 
        communities and the United States;
Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, including peer pressure, 
        bullying, mental health issues, the deployment of family members to 
        serve in conflicts overseas, and school violence;
Whereas a school counselor is 1 of the few professionals in a school building 
        who is trained in both education and social and emotional development;
Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors are often 
        misunderstood;
Whereas the school counselor position is often among the first to be eliminated 
        to meet budgetary constraints;
Whereas the national average ratio of students to school counselors is 471 to 1, 
        almost twice the 250 to 1 ratio recommended by the American School 
        Counselor Association, the National Association for College Admission 
        Counseling, and other organizations; and
Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week will increase 
        awareness of the important and necessary role school counselors play in 
        the lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates February 2 through 6, 2015, as ``National 
        School Counseling Week''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National School Counseling Week with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities that promote awareness of the role school counselors 
        play in schools and the community at large in preparing 
        students for fulfilling lives as contributing members of 
        society.
