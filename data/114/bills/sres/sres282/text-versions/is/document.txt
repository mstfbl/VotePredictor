                               RESOLUTION


 
      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Diabetes Month.

Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to 
        in this preamble as the ``CDC''), in the United States--

    (1) nearly 30,000,000 individuals have diabetes; and

    (2) an estimated 86,000,000 individuals aged 20 years and older have 
prediabetes;

Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that affects individuals of 
        every age, race, ethnicity, and income level;
Whereas the CDC reports that Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans, and 
        Native Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes and suffer 
        from the disease at rates that are much higher than the general 
        population of the United States;
Whereas according to the CDC, an individual aged 20 years or older is diagnosed 
        with diabetes every 19 seconds;
Whereas approximately 4,660 individuals in the United States aged 20 years or 
        older are diagnosed with diabetes each day;
Whereas the CDC estimates that approximately 1,700,000 individuals in the United 
        States aged 20 years and older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 
        2012;
Whereas a joint study carried out by the National Institutes of Health and the 
        CDC found that in the United States during 2008 and 2009, an estimated 
        18,436 youth were newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and 5,089 youth 
        were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes;
Whereas according to the CDC, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States 
        increased by more than 300 percent between 1980 and 2010;
Whereas the CDC reports that 27.8 percent of individuals with diabetes in the 
        United States have not been diagnosed with the disease;
Whereas in the United States, more than 12 percent of adults aged 20 years or 
        older and 25.9 percent of individuals aged 65 years or older have 
        diabetes;
Whereas, as many as 1 in 3 adults in the United States will have diabetes in 
        2050 if the present trend continues;
Whereas after accounting for the difference of the average age of each 
        population, data surveying individuals aged 20 years or older in the 
        United States between 2010 and 2012 indicates that 7.6 percent of non-
        Hispanic Whites, 13.2 percent of non-Hispanic Blacks, 12.8 percent of 
        Hispanics, and 9.0 percent of Asian Americans suffered from diagnosed 
        diabetes;
Whereas after accounting for the difference of the average age of each 
        population, data surveying Hispanic individuals aged 20 years or older 
        in the United States between 2010 and 2012 indicates that 8.5 percent of 
        individuals of Central and South American descent, 9.3 percent of 
        individuals of Cuban descent, 13.9 percent of individuals of Mexican 
        descent, and 14.8 percent of individuals of Puerto Rican descent 
        suffered from diagnosed diabetes;
Whereas according to the American Diabetes Association, in 2012, the United 
        States spent an estimated $245,000,000,000 on cases of diagnosed 
        diabetes;
Whereas the American Diabetes Association reports that 20 percent of the funds 
        that the United States spent on health care in 2012 went towards caring 
        for individuals with diabetes;
Whereas a study carried out by Mathematica Policy Research found that total 
        expenditures for individuals with diabetes receiving benefits under the 
        Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1395 et seq.) in fiscal year 2005 comprised 32.7 percent of the budget 
        for the Medicare program in that fiscal year;
Whereas according to the CDC, in the United States in 2010, diabetes--

    (1) was the seventh leading cause of death; and

    (2) contributed to the death of more than 234,051 individuals;

Whereas, as of November 2015, a cure for diabetes does not exist;
Whereas there are successful means to reduce the incidence and delay the onset 
        of type 2 diabetes;
Whereas with proper management and treatment, individuals with diabetes live 
        healthy, productive lives; and
Whereas individuals in the United States celebrate American Diabetes Month in 
        November: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Diabetes 
        Month, including--
                    (A) encouraging individuals in the United States to 
                fight diabetes through public awareness of prevention 
                and treatment options; and
                    (B) enhancing diabetes education;
            (2) recognizes the importance of early detection, awareness 
        of the symptoms, and understanding the risk factors of 
        diabetes, including--
                    (A) being over the age of 45 years;
                    (B) having a specific racial and ethnic background;
                    (C) being overweight;
                    (D) having a low level of physical activity;
                    (E) having high blood pressure; and
                    (F) having a family history of diabetes or a 
                history of diabetes during pregnancy; and
            (3) supports decreasing the prevalence of type 1, type 2, 
        and gestational diabetes in the United States through increased 
        research, treatment, and prevention.
