                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            November 3, 2015

  Mr. Alexander (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating the week beginning November 8, 2015, as ``National Nurse-
                     Managed Health Clinic Week''.

Whereas a nurse-managed health clinic is a nonprofit community-based health care 
        site that offers primary care and wellness services based on the nursing 
        model;
Whereas the nursing model emphasizes--

    (1) protection, promotion, and optimization of health;

    (2) prevention of illness;

    (3) alleviation of suffering; and

    (4) diagnosis and treatment of illness;

Whereas an advanced practice nurse leads each nurse-managed health clinic and an 
        interdisciplinary team of highly qualified health care professionals 
        staffs each nurse-managed health clinic;
Whereas each nurse-managed health clinic offers a broad scope of services, 
        including--

    (1) treatment for acute and chronic illnesses;

    (2) routine physical exams;

    (3) immunizations for adults and children;

    (4) disease screenings;

    (5) health education;

    (6) prenatal care;

    (7) dental care; and

    (8) drug and alcohol treatment;

Whereas, as of September 2015, approximately 500 nurse-managed health clinics--

    (1) provided care in the United States; and

    (2) recorded more than 2,500,000 patient encounters annually;

Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique, dual role as healthcare 
        safety net access points and health workforce development sites, because 
        the majority of nurse-managed health clinics--

    (1) are affiliated with schools of nursing; and

    (2) serve as clinical education sites for students entering the health 
profession;

Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the healthcare safety net by 
        expanding access to primary care and chronic disease management services 
        for vulnerable and medically underserved populations in diverse rural, 
        urban, and suburban communities;
Whereas research has shown that--

    (1) nurse-managed health clinics experience high rates of--

    G    (A) patient retention; and

    G    (B) patient satisfaction; and

    (2) nurse-managed health clinic patients, compared to patients of other 
similar safety net providers, experience--

    G    (A) higher rates of generic medication fills; and

    G    (B) lower hospitalization rates;

Whereas the 2013 Health Affairs article, ``Nurse-Managed Health Centers And 
        Patient-Centered Medical Homes Could Mitigate Expected Primary Care 
        Physician Shortage'', highlights the ability of each nurse-managed 
        health clinic to bring high-quality care to individuals who may not 
        otherwise receive needed services; and
Whereas each nurse-managed health clinic that offers primary care and wellness 
        services provides quality care in a cost-effective manner: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning November 8, 2015, as 
        ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';
            (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed 
        Health Clinic Week; and
            (3) encourages the continued support of nurse-managed 
        health clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may 
        continue to serve as healthcare workforce development sites for 
        the next generation of primary care providers.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
