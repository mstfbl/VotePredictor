Expressing the sense of the Senate about a strategy for the Internet of 
      Things to promote economic growth and consumer empowerment.

Whereas the Internet of Things currently connects tens of billions of devices 
        worldwide and has the potential to generate trillions of dollars in 
        economic opportunity;
Whereas increased connectivity can empower consumers in nearly every aspect of 
        their daily lives, including in the fields of agriculture, education, 
        energy, healthcare, public safety, security, and transportation, to name 
        just a few;
Whereas businesses across our economy can simplify logistics, cut costs in 
        supply chains, and pass savings on to consumers because of the Internet 
        of Things and innovations derived from it;
Whereas the United States should strive to be a world leader in smart cities and 
        smart infrastructure to ensure its citizens and businesses, in both 
        rural and urban parts of the country, have access to the safest and most 
        resilient communities in the world;
Whereas the United States is the world leader in developing the Internet of 
        Things technology, and with a strategy guiding both public and private 
        entities, the United States will continue to produce breakthrough 
        technologies and lead the world in innovation;
Whereas the evolution of the Internet of Things is a nascent market, the future 
        direction of which holds much promise;
Whereas the Internet of Things represents a wide range of technologies that are 
        governed by various laws, policies, and governmental entities; and
Whereas coordination between all stakeholders of the Internet of Things on 
        relevant developments, impediments, and achievements is a vital 
        ingredient to the continued advancement of pioneering technology: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States should develop a strategy to 
        incentivize the development of the Internet of Things in a way 
        that maximizes the promise connected technologies hold to 
        empower consumers, foster future economic growth, and improve 
        our collective social well-being;
            (2) the United States should prioritize accelerating the 
        development and deployment of the Internet of Things in a way 
        that recognizes its benefits, allows for future innovation, and 
        responsibly protects against misuse;
            (3) the United States should recognize the importance of 
        consensus-based best practices and communication among 
        stakeholders, with the understanding that businesses can play 
        an important role in the future development of the Internet of 
        Things;
            (4) the United States Government should commit itself to 
        using the Internet of Things to improve its efficiency and 
        effectiveness and cut waste, fraud, and abuse whenever 
        possible; and
            (5) using the Internet of Things, innovators in the United 
        States should commit to improving the quality of life for 
        future generations by developing safe, new technologies aimed 
        at tackling the most challenging societal issues facing the 
        world.
