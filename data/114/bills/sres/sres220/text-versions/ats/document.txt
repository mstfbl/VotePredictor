                               RESOLUTION


 
       Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Medora Musical.

Whereas the Medora Musical, a nationally renowned musical production of Western 
        American patriotism, held its first production on July 1, 1965, 
        alongside what is now the Theodore Roosevelt National Park;
Whereas more than 3,500,000 guests have experienced the incredible tribute in 
        the Medora Musical to Theodore Roosevelt and his life in the North 
        Dakota Badlands;
Whereas the Burning Hills Amphitheater, which is home to the Medora Musical and 
        overlooks the Little Missouri River Valley, seats as many as 2,900 
        guests each night and features the Burning Hills Singers, the Coal 
        Diggers Band, and various comedy and variety acts;
Whereas thousands of performers audition to join the professional team of the 
        Medora Musical and work alongside 300 annual employees representing 20 
        or more countries and more than 500 volunteers to create one of the 
        finest attractions in North Dakota;
Whereas each summer, the Medora Musical runs an impressive season with a 2 hour 
        show every night for 94 consecutive days;
Whereas the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation, established in 1986 by 
        philanthropist and entrepreneur Harold Schafer, has played a profound 
        role in promoting North Dakota tourism and bringing families of all 
        generations together;
Whereas the city of Medora, North Dakota, home to the Medora Musical and gateway 
        to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, hosts more than 250,000 
        visitors each year, and more than 600,000 tourists from around the world 
        visit the park each year;
Whereas the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation, which has invested more than 
        $30,000,000 in Medora, North Dakota, raised more than $36,000,000 in 
        donations from more than 3,700 contributors to preserve the history of 
        Medora, North Dakota, and the values of President Theodore Roosevelt;
Whereas President Theodore Roosevelt, following his time in the Badlands near 
        Medora, North Dakota, likened the wondrous appeal of the Badlands to a 
        one-of-a-kind beauty found nowhere else in the world;
Whereas President Theodore Roosevelt often said he would not have been President 
        had it not been for his experiences in North Dakota, and many of those 
        experiences are preserved today through the Medora Musical, Theodore 
        Roosevelt National Park, and the Theodore Roosevelt Medora Foundation; 
        and
Whereas, on July 1, 2015, the Medora Musical celebrates its 50th anniversary: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Medora Musical on its 50th 
        anniversary;
            (2) recognizes the remarkable talents and achievements of 
        the many cast and crew members and volunteers of the Medora 
        Musical who embody the true spirit of the patriotism and 
        stewardship of the United States; and
            (3) acknowledges the contributions of the Theodore 
        Roosevelt Medora Foundation to preserving the life and legacy 
        of President Theodore Roosevelt.
                                 <all>
