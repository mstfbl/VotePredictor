                               RESOLUTION


 
  Calling on the Department of Defense, other elements of the Federal 
Government, and foreign countries to intensify efforts to investigate, 
recover, and identify all missing and unaccounted-for personnel of the 
                             United States.

Whereas more than 83,000 personnel of the United States are still unaccounted-
        for around the world from past wars and conflicts;
Whereas, though recognizing that an estimated 50,000 of these World War II 
        personnel, were lost deep at sea and are unlikely ever to be recovered, 
        thousands of families and friends have waited decades for the accounting 
        of their loved ones and comrades in arms;
Whereas the families of these brave Americans deserve our Nation's best efforts 
        to achieve the fullest possible accounting for their missing loved ones;
Whereas the National League of POW/MIA Families, and their iconic POW/MIA flag, 
        pioneered the accounting effort since 1970 and has been joined in this 
        humanitarian quest for answers by the Korean War, Cold War and World War 
        II families, fully supported by the American Legion, the Veterans of 
        Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, Jewish War Veterans, 
        AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, Special Forces Association, Special 
        Operations Association, Rolling Thunder, and other more recently formed 
        groups, and thousands of families are yearning and advocating for 
        answers concerning the fates of their loved ones and comrades in arms;
Whereas the mission of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency of the Department 
        of Defense is to provide the fullest possible accounting for missing 
        members of the Armed Forces of the United States, designated civilians 
        of the Department, and other designated personnel; and
Whereas the recovery and investigation teams of the Department of Defense deploy 
        to countries around the world to account as fully as possible for these 
        missing and otherwise unaccounted-for personnel of the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) calls upon the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency and 
        other elements of the Department of Defense, other elements of 
        the Federal Government, and all foreign countries to intensify 
        efforts to investigate, recover, identify and account as fully 
        as possible for all missing and unaccounted-for personnel of 
        the United States around the world; and
            (2) calls upon all foreign countries with information on 
        missing personnel of the United States, or with missing 
        personnel of the United States within their territories, to 
        cooperate fully with the Government of the United States to 
        provide the fullest possible accounting for all missing 
        personnel of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
