                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Historic Columbia River Highway on its 100th year.

Whereas June 7, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of the Historic Columbia River 
        Highway, a 75-mile-long scenic highway designed by Samuel C. Lancaster 
        that runs through the Columbia River Gorge between Troutdale and The 
        Dalles, Oregon;
Whereas the Historic Columbia River Highway, the first scenic highway in the 
        United States and the first modern highway in the Pacific Northwest, is 
        a National Historic Landmark;
Whereas Samuel C. Lancaster wrote that, when engineering the Historic Columbia 
        River Highway, Lancaster aimed ``to find . . . the points where the most 
        beautiful things along the line might be seen to the best advantage, and 
        if possible to locate the road in such a way as to reach them'';
Whereas the Historic Columbia River Highway is an engineering masterpiece that 
        successfully used innovative engineering techniques to complement the 
        magnificent natural landscape of the Columbia River Gorge;
Whereas the Historic Columbia River Highway showcases all aspects of the rich 
        and diverse natural landscape of Oregon, including Multnomah Falls, the 
        fourth-largest waterfall in the United States;
Whereas the construction of a water-level route through the Columbia River 
        Gorge, now Interstate 84, destroyed many sections of the Historic 
        Columbia River Highway;
Whereas, in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986 (Public 
        Law 99-663; 100 Stat. 4274), Congress directed the Oregon Department of 
        Transportation to prepare a program to preserve and restore the Historic 
        Columbia River Highway for public use as a historic road;
Whereas the State of Oregon is working to connect intact and usable highway 
        segments with recreation trails, where feasible, to create a continuous 
        historic road route through the Columbia River Gorge that links local, 
        State, and Federal recreation facilities; and
Whereas the continued preservation and restoration of the Historic Columbia 
        River Highway will provide greater access to the Columbia River Gorge 
        for recreation and tourism, which will help to boost the economies of 
        the region: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Historic Columbia River Highway on 
        its 100th year;
            (2) recognizes the cultural, economic, and environmental 
        importance of the Historic Columbia River Highway;
            (3) expresses support for the continued success of the 
        restoration of the Historic Columbia River Highway; and
            (4) requests that the Secretary of the Senate prepare an 
        official copy of this resolution for presentation to Senator 
        Wyden, Senator Merkley, and Kevin Gorman of Friends of the 
        Columbia Gorge.
                                 <all>
