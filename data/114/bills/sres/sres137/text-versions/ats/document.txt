   Congratulating the administration, staff, students, and alumni of 
  Roosevelt University on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the 
                              University.

Whereas on April 17, 2015, Roosevelt University, located in Chicago, Illinois, 
        will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the University on 
        April 17, 1945;
Whereas Roosevelt University has graduated more than 95,000 students who have 
        become leaders in their professions and careers, including the first 
        African-American mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington;
Whereas Roosevelt University was founded at a time when most institutions of 
        higher education in the United States did not enroll large numbers of 
        minority or immigrant students;
Whereas Roosevelt University became 1 of the first colleges in the United States 
        to admit all qualified students, regardless of race, religion, or 
        national origin;
Whereas throughout its history, Roosevelt University has always remained true to 
        the values of inclusiveness, opportunity, and social justice; and
Whereas today, Roosevelt remains 1 of the most diverse universities in the 
        Midwest: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the administration, staff, students, and 
        alumni of Roosevelt University on the occasion of the 70th 
        anniversary of the University; and
            (2) wishes the entire Roosevelt community many years of 
        continued success in the future.
