                               RESOLUTION


 
 Providing official recognition of the massacre of 11 African-American 
 soldiers of the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion of the United States 
 Army who had been captured near Wereth, Belgium, during the Battle of 
                    the Bulge on December 17, 1944.

Whereas, during the Battle of the Bulge in Belgium in December 1944, elements of 
        the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion, an African-American unit, were 
        among the units of the United States Army overrun in the initial German 
        attack;
Whereas 11 soldiers from different batteries of the 333rd Field Artillery 
        Battalion attempted to escape capture and return to the lines of the 
        United States;
Whereas the 11 soldiers were Curtis Adams of South Carolina, Mager Bradley of 
        Mississippi, George Davis, Jr., of Alabama, Thomas Forte of Mississippi, 
        Robert Green of Georgia, James Leatherwood of Mississippi, Nathaniel 
        Moss of Texas, George Motten of Texas, William Pritchett of Alabama, 
        James Stewart of West Virginia, and Due Turner of Arkansas;
Whereas the 11 soldiers were captured by a German patrol composed of SS 
        soldiers, who, after dark, marched the unarmed soldiers to a nearby 
        field and massacred them;
Whereas the massacre of the 11 African-American soldiers of the 333rd Field 
        Artillery Battalion in Wereth remains unknown to the vast majority of 
        the people of the United States; and
Whereas, in 2004, a permanent monument was dedicated in Wereth to the 11 
        African-American soldiers of the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion who 
        lost their lives in Wereth during the Battle of the Bulge in an effort 
        to defeat fascism and defend freedom: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate officially recognizes the dedicated 
service and ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the United States of the 11 
African-American soldiers of the 333rd Field Artillery Battalion of the 
United States Army who were massacred in Wereth, Belgium, during the 
Battle of the Bulge on December 17, 1944.
                                 <all>
