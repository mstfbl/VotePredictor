_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week of September 12, 2016, as ``National Direct 
               Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct support professionals, including direct care workers, personal 
        assistants, personal attendants, in-home support workers, and 
        paraprofessionals, are key to providing publicly funded, long-term 
        support and services for millions of individuals with disabilities;
Whereas direct support professionals provide essential support to help keep 
        individuals with disabilities connected to their families, friends, and 
        communities so as to avoid more costly institutional care;
Whereas direct support professionals support individuals with disabilities by 
        helping those individuals make person-centered choices that lead to 
        meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas direct support professionals must build close, respectful, and trusted 
        relationships with individuals with disabilities;
Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of individualized 
        support to individuals with disabilities, including--

    (1) assisting with the preparation of meals;

    (2) helping with medication;

    (3) assisting with bathing, dressing, and other aspects of daily 
living;

    (4) assisting with access to their environment;

    (5) providing transportation to school, work, religious, and 
recreational activities; and

    (6) helping with general daily affairs, such as assisting with 
financial matters, medical appointments, and personal interests;

Whereas the participation of direct support professionals in medical care 
        planning is critical to the successful transition of individuals from 
        medical events to post-acute care and long-term support and services;
Whereas there is a documented critical and increasing shortage of direct support 
        professionals throughout the United States;
Whereas direct support professionals are a critical element in supporting 
        individuals who are receiving health care services for severe chronic 
        health conditions and individuals with functional limitations;
Whereas many direct support professionals are the primary financial providers 
        for their families;
Whereas direct support professionals are hardworking, taxpaying citizens who 
        provide an important service to people with disabilities in the United 
        States, yet many continue to earn low wages, receive inadequate 
        benefits, and have limited opportunities for advancement, resulting in 
        high turnover and vacancy rates that adversely affect the quality of 
        support, safety, and health of individuals with disabilities;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in Olmstead v. L.C. by Zimring, 
        527 U.S. 581 (June 22, 1999)--

    (1) recognized the importance of the deinstitutionalization of, and 
community-based services for, individuals with disabilities; and

    (2) held that, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S. 12101 et seq.), a State must provide community-based services to 
persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities if--

    G    (A) the community-based services are appropriate;

    G    (B) the affected person does not oppose receiving the community-
based services; and

    G    (C) the community-based services can be reasonably accommodated 
after the community has taken into account the resources available to the 
State and the needs of other individuals with disabilities in the State; 
and

Whereas, in 2016, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in 
        home- and community-based settings and that trend will increase over the 
        next decade: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of September 12, 2016, as 
        ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes and appreciates the contribution, 
        dedication, and vital role of direct support professionals in 
        enhancing the lives of individuals with disabilities of all 
        ages;
            (3) commends direct support professionals for being 
        integral to the provision of long-term support and services for 
        individuals with disabilities; and
            (4) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies affecting individuals with disabilities in the United 
        States depends on the dedication of direct support 
        professionals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
