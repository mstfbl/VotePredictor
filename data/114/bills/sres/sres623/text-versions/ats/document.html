                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the vital role the Civil Air Patrol has played, and 
  continues to play, in supporting the homeland security and national 
                     defense of the United States.

Whereas, on December 1, 1941, a new civilian defense organization known as the 
        Civil Air Patrol was founded, which was to rely on volunteer civilian 
        aviators who would fly in support of the homeland security of the United 
        States;
Whereas with the attack on Pearl Harbor 6 days later and the entry of the United 
        States into World War II, the Civil Air Patrol would find itself serving 
        the United States in ways that were not imagined at the time of the 
        conception of the Civil Air Patrol;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol initially engaged in coastal patrol operations that 
        were considered critical to the United States war effort, piloting 
        aircraft that in total flew 24,000,000 miles over 18 months, reporting 
        173 possible enemy submarines, and dropping 82 bombs or depth charges;
Whereas Civil Air Patrol civilian volunteers flew privately owned light aircraft 
        armed with military bombs at the expense of the volunteers, often at low 
        altitude, in bad weather, and up to 60 miles from shore;
Whereas Civil Air Patrol civilian volunteers undertook other vital World War II 
        missions nationwide, which included border patrols, search and rescue 
        operations, courier and cargo services, and air defense and pilot 
        training;
Whereas, unlike many organizations at the time, the Civil Air Patrol welcomed 
        women into its ranks to fly for the Civil Air Patrol, with approximately 
        one-half of the women later joining the Women's Airforce Service Pilots 
        (commonly known as ``WASP'') after having first flown with the Civil Air 
        Patrol;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol was open to all pilots interested in flying for the 
        Civil Air Patrol, which allowed African-Americans an opportunity to 
        serve and fly for the United States well before the adoption of the 
        integrated Armed Forces;
Whereas, in 2016, the Civil Air Patrol continues its critical mission in service 
        to the United States, now as a vital partner for the Air Force, serving 
        as the auxiliary force, and, since 2015, as an official component of the 
        total force;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol remains one of the premier inland search and rescue 
        organizations of the United States, and was credited with saving the 
        lives of 69 individuals through search and rescue operations in 2015;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol continues to fulfill many other vital missions, 
        including helping train interceptor pilots and unmanned aerial vehicle 
        operators under realistic conditions, aerial observation missions, 
        counterdrug operations, disaster relief support, live organ transport, 
        aerospace education, cadet programs, and Reserve Officer Training Corps 
        orientation flights;
Whereas the continued work of the all-volunteer force of the Civil Air Patrol 
        offers vital support to homeland security and defense missions; and
Whereas the weekly youth and aerospace education programs of the Civil Air 
        Patrol continue to introduce young students to the field of aviation and 
        instill within the students the values of national service and personal 
        responsibility: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) applauds the Civil Air Patrol for 75 years of 
        continuous service in times of peace and war;
            (2) recognizes the critical emergency services, training 
        support, and mission capabilities that the Civil Air Patrol 
        offers State and national homeland security agencies as well as 
        the United States Armed Forces; and
            (3) commends the more than 23,500 youth and 32,500 adult 
        volunteers of the Civil Air Patrol, who hail from a range of 
        professions and across the United States, and dedicate their 
        time to the service of their communities and the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
