                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 140th anniversary of the Marine Engineers' Beneficial 
                              Association.

Whereas the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association (in this preamble referred 
        to as the ``M.E.B.A.'') was founded in 1875 and is the oldest maritime 
        union in the United States;
Whereas, soon after the founding of the M.E.B.A., the M.E.B.A. battled for 
        beneficial legislation to certify, license, and protect waterborne 
        engineers;
Whereas the M.E.B.A. prevailed in securing deck and engine officers of the 
        United States aboard flagships of the United States, displacing foreign 
        seamen;
Whereas, since 1875, the M.E.B.A. has been the premier maritime labor union for 
        the officers of the United States Merchant Marine;
Whereas the members of the M.E.B.A., including thousands of marine engine and 
        deck officers, are unparalleled in maritime training and experience;
Whereas M.E.B.A. members crew the most technologically advanced ships in the 
        flag fleet of the United States, including container ships, tankers, 
        Great Lakes and liquefied natural gas vessels, and a cruise ship;
Whereas M.E.B.A. members sail aboard Government-contracted ships of the Military 
        Sealift Command of the United States Navy and the Ready Reserve Force of 
        the Maritime Administration, on tugs and ferry fleets around the United 
        States, and in various capacities in shoreside industries;
Whereas M.E.B.A. members provide critical support to the United States by 
        carrying cargo to aid the Armed Forces of the United States in overseas 
        conflicts;
Whereas, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the commercial, privately owned fleet, 
        crewed by civilians of the United States, carried more than 85 percent 
        of the materials and equipment needed by the United States and the 
        allies of the United States to achieve victory;
Whereas, since 1875, M.E.B.A. members have served in every conflict and war in 
        which the United States has been involved, including the Spanish-
        American War, World Wars I and II, Operation Enduring Freedom, and 
        Operation Iraqi Freedom;
Whereas the M.E.B.A. brings critical food aid to starving people in Ethiopia, 
        Somalia, and dozens of other countries around the world;
Whereas, as the people of the United States watched the tragedy of September 11, 
        2001, unfold, members of the M.E.B.A. ferried thousands of people to 
        safety in New York;
Whereas, during the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the tsunami in 
        Southeast Asia, and countless other disasters, the M.E.B.A. was there 
        with the professionalism, pride, and patriotism that has long been the 
        hallmark of mariners of the United States;
Whereas the M.E.B.A. has its own maritime training center, the Calhoon M.E.B.A. 
        Engineering School in Easton, Maryland, which keeps seafaring members on 
        the cutting edge of the industry; and
Whereas the Calhoon M.E.B.A. Engineering School was originally located in 
        Baltimore because of the rich maritime tradition in that city but later 
        moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland when the school needed to expand: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the 140th anniversary of the 
Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
