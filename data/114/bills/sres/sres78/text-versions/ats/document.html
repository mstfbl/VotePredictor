                               RESOLUTION


 
Relative to the death of Jerry Tarkanian, former head basketball coach 
                of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

Whereas Jerry Tarkanian was born August 8, 1930, in Euclid, Ohio, graduated from 
        Fresno State in 1955, and earned a Master's degree from the University 
        of Redlands in 1956;
Whereas Jerry Tarkanian is survived by his wife, 4 children, and 11 
        grandchildren;
Whereas Jerry Tarkanian never had a losing season during the 19 years he coached 
        the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) men's basketball team from 
        1973 to 1992, leading the ``Runnin' Rebels'' to a 509-105 record, 4 
        Final Four appearances, and the 1990 National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association (NCAA) Division I Men's Basketball National Championship;
Whereas UNLV won the 1990 championship game by defeating the Duke University 
        Blue Devils 103 to 73, the highest margin of victory in a championship 
        game in NCAA Division I history;
Whereas Jerry Tarkanian unified the Las Vegas community, and became beloved by 
        Nevadans and many more throughout the United States who watched as 
        Tarkanian coached his teams to victory in the Thomas & Mack Center (also 
        known as ``the Shark Tank''), often while nervously chewing a towel at 
        courtside;
Whereas over the course of a 38-year career that spanned high school, junior 
        college, Division I of the NCAA, and the National Basketball 
        Association, Jerry Tarkanian won 990 career games and received the 1983 
        United Press International Coach of the Year award;
Whereas Jerry Tarkanian's immeasurable contributions to the game of basketball, 
        which included his signature usage of the amoeba defense to wear down 
        opposing teams, were recognized when he was inducted into the Naismith 
        Memorial Hall of Fame in 2013; and
Whereas Jerry Tarkanian's off-the-court contributions to Las Vegas and the 
        entire State of Nevada are admired and deeply appreciated by all who 
        call Nevada home: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) has heard with profound sorrow and deep regret the 
        announcement of the death of Jerry Tarkanian; and
            (2) requests the Secretary of the Senate to prepare an 
        official copy of this resolution for presentation to the family 
        of Jerry Tarkanian.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
