Establishing May 2, 2015, as a Day of Recognition for Ebola Orphans to 
  express support for the children and families affected by the 2014 
Ebola outbreak in West Africa by promoting awareness of the children of 
    West Africa who have been orphaned by the 2014 Ebola epidemic, 
 celebrating those who have recognized and are working to fulfill the 
   needs of those children, and encouraging the people of the United 
        States to continue to support the people of West Africa.

Whereas the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa reached epidemic proportions;
Whereas the World Health Organization reports that there have been over 14,800 
        laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone 
        as of April 19, 2015;
Whereas the World Health Organization reports that there have been over 10,800 
        deaths from Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of April 19, 
        2015;
Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that as of 
        February 2015, nearly 11,000 children in West Africa have lost 1 or both 
        parents due to the 2014 Ebola outbreak;
Whereas some families reject Ebola orphans out of fear of the disease;
Whereas the United States authorized $750,000,000 to support up to 3,000 United 
        States troops in Monrovia, Liberia, to respond to the Ebola crisis; and
Whereas United States citizens have given time and resources to assist the 
        people of West Africa, including Ebola orphans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes May 2, 2015, as a Day of Recognition for 
        Ebola Orphans, to promote awareness of the children of West 
        Africa orphaned by the 2014 Ebola outbreak;
            (2) supports the goals and work of those who are addressing 
        the developing Ebola orphan crisis in West Africa; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider 
        the needs of the children of West Africa who were orphaned by 
        the 2014 Ebola epidemic.
