                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the recognition of 2016 as the ``Year of Pulses'' and 
  acknowledging the nutritional benefit and important contribution to 
                      soil health of pulse crops.

Whereas the United States will celebrate 2016 as the ``Year of Pulses'';
Whereas the 68th United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 as the 
        International Year of Pulses;
Whereas a pulse is a dry, edible seed of a plant in the legume family, including 
        a dry bean, dry pea, lentil, or chickpea;
Whereas pulse crops are grown in abundance in Arizona, California, Colorado, 
        Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North 
        Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming;
Whereas a pulse is an important component of a nutritious diet and is high in 
        plant-based protein, vitamins, fiber, and minerals, including iron, 
        potassium, magnesium, and zinc;
Whereas a pulse helps prevent serious and chronic illness, including heart 
        disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke;
Whereas a legume serves as an important rotation crop, keeps soil fertile, and 
        improves overall soil health by replenishing nitrogen;
Whereas a pulse crop provides food security and nutrition to much of the 
        developing world as a low-cost source of protein; and
Whereas a pulse crop is an important economic development crop for small 
        farmers, for both domestic production and export potential: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports--
            (1) the recognition of 2016 as the ``Year of Pulses'';
            (2) the participation by representatives of the Federal 
        Government in events and activities organized pursuant to the 
        observance by the United Nations of the International Year of 
        Pulses in 2016; and
            (3) the future funding of programs to support the 
        cultivation and consumption of pulses.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
