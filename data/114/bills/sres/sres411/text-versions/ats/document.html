Expressing support for the goals and ideals of the biennial USA Science 
  & Engineering Festival in Washington, DC, and designating April 11 
  through April 17, 2016, as ``National Science and Technology Week''.

Whereas science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``STEM'') are essential to the future global competitiveness 
        of the United States;
Whereas advances in technology have resulted in significant improvement in the 
        daily life of each individual in the United States;
Whereas scientific discoveries are critical to curing diseases, solving global 
        challenges, and an increased understanding of the world;
Whereas the future global economy requires a workforce that is educated in 
        science and engineering specialties;
Whereas educating a new generation of individuals in the United States in STEM 
        is crucial to ensure continued economic growth;
Whereas an increase in the interest of the next generation of students in the 
        United States, particularly young women and underrepresented minorities, 
        in STEM is necessary to maintain the global competitiveness of the 
        United States;
Whereas science and engineering festivals have attracted millions of 
        participants and inspired an effort throughout the United States to 
        promote science and engineering;
Whereas thousands of institutions of higher education, museums, science centers, 
        STEM professional societies, educational societies, government agencies 
        and laboratories, community organizations, elementary and secondary 
        schools, volunteers, corporate and private sponsors, and nonprofit 
        organizations come together to organize the USA Science & Engineering 
        Festival in Washington, DC, during April 2016;
Whereas the USA Science & Engineering Festival, through exhibits on topics 
        including human spaceflight, medicine, engineering, biotechnology, 
        physics, and astronomy--

    (1) reinvigorates the interest of young individuals in the United 
States in STEM; and

    (2) highlights the important contributions of science and engineering 
to the competitiveness of the United States; and

Whereas scientific research is essential to the competitiveness of the United 
        States, and an event such as the USA Science & Engineering Festival 
        promotes the importance of scientific research and development for the 
        future of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses support for the goals and ideals of the USA 
        Science & Engineering Festival to promote, as the cornerstones 
        of innovation and competition in the United States--
                    (A) scholarship in science; and
                    (B) an interest in scientific research and 
                development;
            (2) supports a festival, such as the USA Science & 
        Engineering Festival, that focuses on the importance of science 
        and engineering to the daily life of each individual in the 
        United States through exhibits on topics including human 
        spaceflight, medicine, engineering, biotechnology, physics, and 
        astronomy;
            (3) congratulates each individual or organization the 
        efforts of which make the USA Science & Engineering Festival 
        possible;
            (4) recognizes that the USA Science & Engineering Festival 
        highlights the accomplishments of the United States in science 
        and engineering;
            (5) encourages each family and child to participate in 1 or 
        more of the activities or exhibits of the USA Science & 
        Engineering Festival, which will occur--
                    (A) in Washington, DC; and
                    (B) across the United States as satellite events; 
                and
            (6) designates April 11 through April 17, 2016, as 
        ``National Science and Technology Week''.
