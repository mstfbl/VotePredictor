                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            October 1, 2015

  Mr. Cassidy (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Calling on Congress, schools, and State and local educational agencies 
to recognize the significant educational implications of dyslexia that 
 must be addressed and designating October 2015 as ``National Dyslexia 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas dyslexia is--

    (1) defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual 
who has the intelligence to be a much better reader; and

    (2) due to a difficulty in getting to the individual sounds of spoken 
language, which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, spell, 
and often, learn a language;

Whereas dyslexia is the most common learning disability and affects 80 percent 
        to 90 percent of all individuals with a learning disability;
Whereas an individual with dyslexia may have weakness in decoding or reading 
        fluency and strength in higher level cognitive functions, such as 
        reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, or problem solving;
Whereas great progress has been made in understanding dyslexia on a scientific 
        level, including the epidemiology and cognitive and neurobiological 
        bases of dyslexia; and
Whereas early diagnosis of dyslexia is critical for ensuring that individuals 
        with dyslexia receive focused, evidence-based intervention that leads to 
        the promotion of self-awareness and self-empowerment and the provision 
        of necessary accommodations so as to ensure school and life success: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) calls on Congress, schools, and State and local 
        educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has significant 
        educational implications that must be addressed; and
            (2) designates October 2015 as ``National Dyslexia 
        Awareness Month''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
