                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the week of January 25 through January 31, 2015, as 
                    ``National School Choice Week''.

Whereas providing a diversity of choices in K-12 education empowers parents to 
        select education environments that meet the individual needs and 
        strengths of their children;
Whereas the United States is home to high-quality K-12 education environments of 
        all varieties, including traditional public schools, public charter 
        schools, public magnet schools, private schools, online academies, and 
        home schooling;
Whereas talented teachers and school leaders in all of these education 
        environments are preparing children to achieve their dreams;
Whereas more families than ever before in the United States are actively 
        choosing the best education for their children;
Whereas greater public awareness of the issue of parental choice in education 
        can inform additional families about the benefits of proactively 
        choosing challenging, motivating, and effective education environments 
        for their children;
Whereas the process of parents choosing schools for their children is 
        nonpolitical, nonpartisan, and deserving of the utmost respect; and
Whereas hundreds of organizations, more than 9,000 schools, and millions of 
        individuals in the United States will celebrate the benefits of 
        educational choice during the fifth annual National School Choice Week, 
        which will be held the week of January 25 through January 31, 2015: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of January 25 through January 31, 
        2015, as ``National School Choice Week'';
            (2) congratulates the students, parents, teachers, and 
        school leaders from K-12 education environments of all 
        varieties for their persistence, achievements, dedication, and 
        contributions to society in the United States;
            (3) encourages all parents, during National School Choice 
        Week, to learn more about the education options available to 
        them; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to hold 
        appropriate programs, events, and activities during National 
        School Choice Week to raise public awareness about the benefits 
        of opportunity in education.
