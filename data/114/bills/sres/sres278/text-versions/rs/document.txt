Welcoming the President of the Republic of Korea on her official visit 
  to the United States and celebrating the United States-Republic of 
              Korea relationship, and for other purposes.

Whereas the Government and people of the United States and the Republic of Korea 
        share a comprehensive alliance, a dynamic partnership, and a personal 
        friendship rooted in the common values of freedom, democracy, and a free 
        market economy;
Whereas the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is a 
        linchpin of regional stability in Asia, including against the threats 
        posed by the regime in Pyongyang;
Whereas cooperation between our nations spans across the security, diplomatic, 
        economic, energy, and cultural spheres;
Whereas the relationship between the people of the United States and the 
        Republic of Korea stretches back to Korea's Chosun Dynasty, when the 
        United States and Korea established diplomatic relations under the 1882 
        Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation;
Whereas the United States-Republic of Korea alliance was forged in blood, with 
        casualties of the United States during the Korean War of 54,246 dead (of 
        whom 33,739 were battle deaths) and more than 103,284 wounded, and 
        casualties of the Republic of Korea of over 50,000 soldiers dead and 
        over 10,000 wounded;
Whereas the Korean War Veterans Recognition Act (Public Law 111-41) was enacted 
        on July 27, 2009, and President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to 
        designate the date as the National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day and 
        called upon Americans to display flags at half-staff in memory of the 
        Korean War veterans;
Whereas the Republic of Korea has stood shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the 
        United States in all 4 major engagements the United States has faced 
        since World War II--the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, in 
        Afghanistan, and in Iraq;
Whereas, since the 1953 Mutual Defense Treaty, to which the Senate gave its 
        advice and consent to ratification on January 26, 1954, United States 
        military personnel have maintained a continuous presence on the Korean 
        Peninsula, and currently there are approximately 28,500 United States 
        troops stationed in the Republic of Korea;
Whereas, in January 2014, the United States and the Republic of Korea 
        successfully concluded negotiations for a new five-year Special Measures 
        Agreement (SMA), establishing the framework for Republic of Korea 
        contributions to offset the costs associated with the stationing of 
        United States Forces Korea (USFK) on the Korean Peninsula;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and the Republic of 
        Korea share a deep commitment to addressing the continued suffering of 
        the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea due to the human 
        rights abuses and repression of the regime in Pyongyang;
Whereas, on March 15, 2012, the United States-Republic of Korea Free Trade 
        Agreement entered into force, which both sides have committed to fully 
        implement, and the Republic of Korea is the United States sixth-largest 
        trade partner, with United States goods and exports to Korea reaching a 
        record level of $44,500,000,000 in 2014, up over 7 percent compared to 
        2013;
Whereas, on May 7, 2013, the United States and the Republic of Korea signed a 
        Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the 
        Alliance Between the Republic of Korea and the United States;
Whereas, on May 8, 2013, Her Excellency Park Geun-hye, the President of the 
        Republic of Korea, addressed a Joint Session of Congress;
Whereas the United States Government notes the address delivered by President 
        Park Geun-hye in Dresden, Germany, on March 28, 2014, and recognizes her 
        efforts to promote peace, stability, and cooperation in Northeast Asia;
Whereas the United States Government appreciates the Government of the Republic 
        of Korea's leadership and the critical role of the United States-
        Republic of Korea alliance in defusing tensions along the Demilitarized 
        Zone (DMZ) in August and September of 2015, that were provoked by the 
        Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;
Whereas there are deep cultural and personal ties between the peoples of the 
        United States and the Republic of Korea, as exemplified by the large 
        flow of visitors and exchanges each year between the 2 countries, 
        including Korean students studying in United States colleges and 
        universities;
Whereas Korean-Americans have made invaluable contributions to our Nation's 
        security, prosperity, and diversity;
Whereas, from October 14-16, 2015, President Park Geun-hye will visit Washington 
        for a second official visit to the United States since her election as 
        President; and
Whereas the United States Government looks forward to continuing to deepen our 
        enduring partnership with the Republic of Korea on security, economic, 
        cultural issues, as well as embracing new opportunities for cooperation 
        on emerging regional and global challenges: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) welcomes Her Excellency Park Geun-hye, the President of 
        the Republic of Korea, on her official visit to the United 
        States;
            (2) reaffirms the importance of the alliance between the 
        United States and the Republic of Korea, as enshrined in the 
        Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, that is vital to peace and 
        security in Northeast Asia, and welcomes opportunities to 
        strengthen security ties, including on space, cyber, and 
        missile defense; and
            (3) encourages the United States Government and the 
        Government of the Republic of Korea to continue to broaden and 
        deepen the alliance by enhancing cooperation in the security, 
        economic, scientific, health, education, and cultural spheres.
