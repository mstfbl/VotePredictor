_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Federation of Natives.

Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives was established as the Alaska 
        Federation of Native Associations at a historic 3-day meeting that began 
        on October 18, 1966, which was the 99th anniversary of the transfer of 
        Alaska from Russia to the United States;
Whereas the establishment of the Alaska Federation of Natives as a statewide 
        voice for the Alaska Native community was necessary--

    (1) to achieve a united stand relating to the settlement of Alaska 
Native land claims; and

    (2) to establish the Alaska Native community as a significant political 
force in the State of Alaska;

Whereas that 3-day initial meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives, which 
        was largely funded by Chief Albert Kaloa, Jr., of the Native Village of 
        Tyonek, was--

    (1) chaired by Emil Notti, a 34-year-old Athabascan Indian from Ruby, 
Alaska, who served as president of the Cook Inlet Native Association; and

    (2) attended by approximately 250 individuals representing 17 Native 
Associations;

Whereas the attendees of that first meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives 
        unanimously adopted the recommendations of a land claims committee 
        chaired by Willie Hensley, including 3 fundamental recommendations 
        that--

    (1) a land freeze be imposed on the transfer of all Federal land until 
Alaska Native land claims were resolved;

    (2) Congress enact legislation to enable settlement of the Alaska 
Native land claims; and

    (3) the Federal Government engage in substantial consultation with 
Alaska Natives, including holding congressional hearings in the State of 
Alaska, before any action was taken on Alaska Native land claims settlement 
legislation;

Whereas in early 1967, a second meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives was 
        held at which--

    (1) the name of the organization was changed to the Alaska Federation 
of Natives;

    (2) Flore Lekanof, an Aleut from St. George, Alaska, was elected 
chairman; and

    (3) Emil Notti was elected president;

Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives diligently pursued legislation for the 
        settlement of Alaska Native land claims, assisted by eminent legal 
        experts, including former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the 
        United States Arthur J. Goldberg and former Attorney General Ramsey 
        Clark;
Whereas in 1970, the Yakima Nation provided critical financial support, in the 
        form of a substantial loan to the Alaska Federation of Natives, to the 
        effort to settle Alaska Native land claims;
Whereas on December 18, 1971, with the enactment of the Alaska Native Claims 
        Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), the Alaska Federation of 
        Natives achieved victory in its goal of settling Alaska Native land 
        claims;
Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives led a successful effort to enact the 
        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Amendments of 1987 (43 U.S.C. 1601 
        note; Public Law 100-241) (commonly known as the ``1991 Amendments''), 
        which amended the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
        seq.);
Whereas for 50 years, the Alaska Federation of Natives has effectively 
        represented the interests of the Alaska Native community on a broad 
        range of significant issues, including Alaska Native self-governance, 
        subsistence, economic development, human development, public safety, and 
        the interests of Alaska Native elders and Alaska Native youth;
Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives continues to be the principal forum and 
        voice of Alaska Natives in dealing with critical issues of public policy 
        and government;
Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives will conduct its 50th anniversary 
        convention from October 20 through 22, 2016, at the Carlson Center in 
        Fairbanks, Alaska;
Whereas the Alaska Federation of Natives convention is the largest 
        representative annual gathering of Native peoples in the United States 
        and the largest convention in the State of Alaska; and
Whereas the theme of the Alaska Federation of Natives 2016 convention is ``50 
        Years: Reflect, Refresh, Renew'', which--

    (1) reflects on the challenges, innovations, and successes of the 
Alaska Native community over the past 50 years;

    (2) refreshes collective accomplishments, achievements, and 
aspirations; and

    (3) renews the commitment and dedication of the Alaska Federation of 
Natives to enriching the future of Native peoples: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the Alaska Federation of Natives on its 50th 
        anniversary;
            (2) commends the past and present officers, board members, 
        delegates, and staff of the Alaska Federation of Natives for 50 
        years of dedication to the advancement of the Native peoples of 
        the State of Alaska; and
            (3) congratulates the Alaska Federation of Natives on 50 
        years of enhancing and promoting the cultural, economic, and 
        political voice of the entire Alaska Native community.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
