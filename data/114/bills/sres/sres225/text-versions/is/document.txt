                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the National Association of Women Business Owners on its 40th 
                              anniversary.

Whereas women-owned businesses are one of the fastest-growing segments of the 
        United States economy;
Whereas 13,600,000 firms are 50 percent or more owned by women, and these 
        businesses employ nearly 15,900,000 people and generate 
        $2,700,000,000,000 in revenue as of 2013;
Whereas empowering more women entrepreneurs and business owners is important to 
        the economic future of the United States;
Whereas the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) was 
        established in 1975 by a group of like-minded businesswomen to serve as 
        the collective voice of women business owners across the country and 
        advocate on behalf of their entrepreneurial interests;
Whereas NAWBO's roots are in public policy, and NAWBO played an integral role in 
        the passage of the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 (Public Law 
        100-533; 102 Stat. 2689);
Whereas NAWBO remains focused on collaborating to create a business-friendly 
        environment at the Federal, State, and local levels to enable women to 
        start and grow their businesses and create jobs; and
Whereas NAWBO represents a diverse universe of women business owners across an 
        array of sectors in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate commends the National Association of 
Women Business Owners for its tireless efforts and decades of support 
of women entrepreneurs and business owners and congratulates the 
National Association of Women Business Owners on its 40th anniversary.
