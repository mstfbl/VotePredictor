                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the immeasurable benefits of the national 4-H program to 
 the young people of the United States and supporting the campaign to 
                        expand the 4-H program.

Whereas in the late 1800s, 4-H clubs developed in rural communities to promote 
        agricultural education among young people;
Whereas the Smith-Lever Act (7 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) established the cooperative 
        extension services, which resulted in a national 4-H program;
Whereas the 4-H program and pledge are based on the values of community service, 
        public leadership, and healthful living;
Whereas 4-H has played an indispensable role in shaping the lives of young 
        leaders in rural areas of the United States for over 100 years;
Whereas nearly 6,000,000 young people are currently involved in 4-H, 40 percent 
        of whom are from urban and suburban backgrounds;
Whereas the 4-H program has evolved to include opportunities for 4-H youth to 
        become proficient in--

    (1) science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM); and

    (2) citizenship and public speaking;

Whereas young people who participate in 4-H are twice as likely as their peers 
        who are not involved in 4-H--

    (1) to be civically engaged;

    (2) to participate in science, engineering, and computer technology 
programs outside of school; and

    (3) to make healthful life choices;

Whereas the National 4-H Congress, National 4-H Conference, and Citizenship 
        Washington Focus give hundreds of young people who participate in 4-H 
        the opportunity to exercise leadership skills nationally and to learn 
        about the history and government of the United States; and
Whereas in April 2016, the National 4-H Council launched a ``Grow True Leaders'' 
        campaign to expand the benefits of 4-H to more communities, with the 
        goal of creating 10,000,000 True Leaders by 2025: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes 4-H as a vital organization for training the 
        next generation for national leadership;
            (2) congratulates the National 4-H Council on its ``Grow 
        True Leaders'' campaign; and
            (3) supports the efforts of the National 4-H Council to 
        grow and diversify the 4-H program.
                                 <all>
