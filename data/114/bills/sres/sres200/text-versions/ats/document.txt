                               RESOLUTION


 
Wishing His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama a happy 80th birthday on July 
6, 2015, and recognizing the outstanding contributions His Holiness has 
    made to the promotion of nonviolence, human rights, interfaith 
           dialogue, environmental awareness, and democracy.

Whereas, for over 50 years, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has significantly 
        advanced greater understanding, tolerance, harmony, and respect among 
        the religious faiths of the world;
Whereas the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 in recognition 
        of his efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the situation in Tibet 
        and to promote nonviolent methods for resolving conflict;
Whereas the Dalai Lama was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 in 
        recognition of his many enduring and outstanding contributions to peace, 
        nonviolence, human rights, and religious understanding;
Whereas the Dalai Lama has led the effort to preserve the rich and unique 
        cultural, religious, historical, and linguistic heritage of the people 
        of Tibet while working to safeguard other endangered cultures throughout 
        the world;
Whereas the 14th Dalai Lama has devolved the traditional role of the Dalai Lama 
        as the political head of the Tibetan government, and his own 
        responsibilities within the Central Tibetan Administration, in favor of 
        the democratically elected leadership of Tibetans in exile, while 
        continuing to travel and speak as a spiritual leader for the people of 
        Tibet;
Whereas the Dalai Lama, together with leading environmentalists, has been 
        gravely concerned by the degraded state of the environment of Tibet and 
        the consumption of the natural resources of Tibet, including freshwater, 
        because the degradations have implications not only for the people of 
        Tibet, but for the whole of Asia; and
Whereas the people of the United States, including Tibetan Americans, have come 
        to regard the Dalai Lama as a leading figure of moral and religious 
        authority: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) extends well-wishes to the Dalai Lama on his 80th 
        birthday;
            (2) recognizes the Dalai Lama for a lifelong commitment and 
        outstanding contribution to the promotion of nonviolence, human 
        rights, religious tolerance, environmental awareness, and 
        democracy; and
            (3) recognizes the Dalai Lama for using moral authority to 
        promote the concept of universal responsibility as a guiding 
        tenet for how human beings should treat one another and the 
        planet that all human beings share.
