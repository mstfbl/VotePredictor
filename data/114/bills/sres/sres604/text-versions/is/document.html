                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 29, 2016

Mr. Kirk submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
          Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of November 2016 as ``National 
                        Bladder Health Month''.

Whereas tens of millions of people in the United States are affected by bladder 
        diseases and conditions, including urinary incontinence, overactive 
        bladder, underactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, nocturia, urinary 
        tract infections, bladder cancer, urotrauma, and neurogenic bladder;
Whereas bladder diseases and conditions have a significant impact on health and 
        quality of life, contributing to decreased physical activity (which can 
        increase obesity levels and the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular 
        disease), depression, social isolation, falls, sexual dysfunction, loss 
        of self-esteem, hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, and even 
        death;
Whereas bladder diseases and conditions result in costs to the United States 
        economy estimated at more than $70,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas bladder problems are highly stigmatized, and open dialogue generated by 
        National Bladder Health Month can reduce stigma and empower providers 
        and patients to have much-needed conversations about bladder health;
Whereas medical and behavioral research to better understand and maintain 
        bladder health and treat bladder diseases is critically needed yet 
        poorly recognized;
Whereas bladder diseases and conditions are common in military veterans;
Whereas more than 1 in 10 military service members injured in Afghanistan and 
        Iraq have urotrauma injuries (damage to the urinary tract or 
        reproductive organs);
Whereas 1 in 3 younger women veterans report overactive bladder, stress urinary 
        incontinence, and painful bladder symptoms;
Whereas more than \3/4\ of veterans with spinal cord injuries suffer from 
        neurogenic bladder;
Whereas bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among 
        Veterans Affairs Health System patients;
Whereas preventative campaigns and measures for diseases and conditions that are 
        as extensive and expensive as bladder diseases and conditions are 
        routine and accepted in common medical, societal, and public health 
        practice, yet no preventative campaign or measure exists in a large, 
        systematic fashion for bladder health; and
Whereas November 2016 is an appropriate month to designate as ``National Bladder 
        Health Month'' since bladder health awareness has been promoted in 
        November for more than 20 years: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of November 2016 
as ``National Bladder Health Month''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
