                               RESOLUTION


 
  Condemning the terrorist attacks in Paris and offering thoughts and 
  prayers for the victims, condolences to their families, resolve to 
 support the people of France, and the pledge to defend democracy and 
 stand in solidarity with the country of France and all our allies in 
        the face of this horrific attack on freedom and liberty.

Whereas, on November 13, 2015, at least eight armed gunmen and suicide bombers 
        conducted six separate attacks across the city of Paris, France, killing 
        at least 129 civilians and wounding over 350 innocent men, women, and 
        children;
Whereas these horrific attacks mark the deadliest violence to strike the 
        Republic of France since World War II, the worst act of terrorism to 
        strike Europe since the 2004 attacks in Madrid, Spain, that killed 191 
        and wounded approximately 1,800 others, and one of the worst terrorist 
        acts carried out on Western soil since the catastrophic attacks of 
        September 11, 2001;
Whereas Paris is still grieving from the January 7, 2015, terrorist attack on 
        the offices of the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo that brutally murdered 
        12 people and injured at least 11 others;
Whereas President of the Republic of France Francois Hollande has declared a 
        national state of emergency and deployed approximately 1,500 military 
        members across the city of Paris;
Whereas President Hollande condemned these events as ``an act of war that was 
        committed by a terrorist army, a jihadist army, Daesh'';
Whereas President Hollande further declared that ``when terrorists are capable 
        of committing such atrocities they must be certain that they are facing 
        a determined France, a united France, a France that is together and does 
        not let itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow'';
Whereas President Barack Obama called these heinous actions not just an attack 
        on Paris and the people of France, but an attack on all of humanity and 
        the universal values that we share;
Whereas the Republic of France is America's oldest ally, dating back to Marquis 
        de Lafayette, and the people of the United States and France mutually 
        share a debt of gratitude that dates from the formation of our republics 
        through two world wars;
Whereas the people of the Republic of France have expressed solidarity with the 
        people of the United States, including following the terrorist attack of 
        September 11, 2001, which claimed the lives of thousands of innocent 
        civilians in the United States;
Whereas the French people have made manifest their commitment to the United 
        States by partnering with United States forces in Afghanistan and Iraq 
        and as an important partner in the fight against extremist terrorism in 
        Mali and around the world;
Whereas at least one United States citizen was murdered in these heinous attacks 
        and at least four others were injured; and
Whereas these attacks represent both an assault on freedom and democracy and an 
        unmitigated evil that the United States and United States allies must 
        stand united to defeat: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the brutal attacks on the people of Paris that 
        resulted in the death of at least 129 people, including one 
        United States citizen, through shootings, hostage-taking, and 
        suicide bombings of innocent, civilian targets;
            (2) expresses its heartfelt condolences and deepest 
        sympathies for the victims and family members of those 
        attacked;
            (3) renews the solidarity of the people and Government of 
        the United States with the people and Government of the 
        Republic of France; and
            (4) pledges support for the Government of France to pursue 
        justice against those involved in these heinous attacks and to 
        prevent future attacks.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
