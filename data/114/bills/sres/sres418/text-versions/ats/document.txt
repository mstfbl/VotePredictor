                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing Hafsat Abiola, Khanim Latif, Yoani Sanchez, and Akanksha 
   Hazari for their selflessness and dedication to their respective 
                    causes, and for other purposes.

Whereas women's leadership in the world is critical to shaping and addressing 
        world events and decreasing global instability;
Whereas women leaders play an integral role in fighting against transnational 
        organized crime, human trafficking, and violence against women, 
        including honor killings, and female genital mutilation;
Whereas changing the trajectory of these dynamics requires empowering women 
        leaders to advance economic opportunity and increase political and 
        public leadership;
Whereas women leaders have selflessly sacrificed, and in some cases placed their 
        lives at risk, to advance causes that will better their communities, 
        their nations, and the world;
Whereas Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria, founder of the Kudirat Initiative for 
        Democracy, campaigns to end violence against women, trains young female 
        leaders, and works to increase civic participation;
Whereas Khanim Latif of Iraq, the Director of Asuda, places her life at risk to 
        provide a safe haven to victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and 
        fights threats of honor killings and female genital cutting;
Whereas Yoani Sanchez of Cuba, founder of ``Generacion Y'', created a blog that 
        captures daily life in Cuba as an effort to encourage political change 
        and increase public awareness and engagement;
Whereas Akanksha Hazari of India fights to deliver basic necessities such as 
        clean water and electricity to impoverished communities and to empower 
        the underserved in India; and
Whereas each of these leaders serves as a role model and an inspiration to help 
        change the lives of others: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes Hafsat Abiola, Khanim Latif, Yoani Sanchez, 
        and Akanksha Hazari for their selflessness and dedication to 
        their respective causes; and
            (2) commends their efforts to advance economic opportunity, 
        increase political and public leadership, combat violence 
        against women, and empower women to address global instability.
                                 <all>
