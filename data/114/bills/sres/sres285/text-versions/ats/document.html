                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the life and accomplishments of Robert Edward Simon, Jr.

Whereas in 1961, Robert Edward Simon, Jr. (referred to in this preamble as ``Bob 
        Simon'') purchased 6,750 acres of undeveloped land in Northern Virginia 
        and in 1964, established on the land the town of Reston, Virginia;
Whereas the vision of Bob Simon for economic development--

    (1) involved communities that integrate jobs, residential housing, 
commercial business, recreational resources, outdoor space, accessible 
transportation, and pedestrian-friendly geography; and

    (2) was a vision that, in 2015, is known as ``smart growth'';

Whereas the vision of Bob Simon for a community was a community that included 
        residents of all income levels and racial backgrounds at a time during 
        which, in Virginia, housing was segregated and interracial marriage was 
        banned;
Whereas Bob Simon is credited with mainstreaming the idea of robust citizen 
        participation in local development plans through community associations;
Whereas Bob Simon returned to live in Reston from 1993 until his passing on 
        September 21, 2015, at 101 years of age; and
Whereas, as of September 2015, Reston, Virginia is a 62,000-citizen town in the 
        Northern Virginia Dulles Corridor, which continues to develop along the 
        lines that Bob Simon envisioned: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the contributions of Robert E. 
Simon, Jr.--
            (1) in founding Reston, Virginia;
            (2) in setting a trend of vibrant urban development in 
        Virginia; and
            (3) in inspiring and empowering citizens across the United 
        States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
