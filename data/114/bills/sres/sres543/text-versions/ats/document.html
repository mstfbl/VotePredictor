                               RESOLUTION


 
    Commemorating the past success of the United States Olympic and 
     Paralympic Teams and supporting the United States Olympic and 
    Paralympic Teams in the 2016 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.

Whereas, for more than 120 years, the Olympic Movement has built a better and 
        more peaceful world by educating young people through amateur athletics, 
        bringing together athletes from many countries in friendly competition, 
        and forging new relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, and fair 
        play;
Whereas the 2016 Olympic Games will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 
        August 5, 2016, to August 21, 2016, and the 2016 Paralympic Games will 
        take place in Rio de Janeiro from September 7, 2016, to September 18, 
        2016;
Whereas, at the 2016 Olympic Games, more than 200 countries will compete in more 
        than 300 events in 42 disciplines, and at the 2016 Paralympic Games, 
        approximately 170 countries will compete in 528 events in 23 
        disciplines;
Whereas the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams have won 1,711 gold 
        medals, 1,415 silver medals, and 1,351 bronze medals, totaling 4,477 
        medals, during the past Olympic and Paralympic Games;
Whereas the people of the United States stand united in respect for and 
        admiration of the members of the United States Olympic and Paralympic 
        Teams and the athletic accomplishments, sportsmanship, and dedication to 
        excellence of the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams;
Whereas the many accomplishments of the United States Olympic and Paralympic 
        Teams would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication 
        of many others, including individuals on the United States Olympic 
        Committee and the National Governing Bodies for Sport and the many 
        administrators, coaches, and family members who provided critical 
        support to the athletes;
Whereas the United States takes great pride in the qualities of commitment to 
        excellence, grace under pressure, and goodwill toward other competitors 
        exhibited by the athletes of the United States Olympic and Paralympic 
        Teams; and
Whereas the Olympic Movement celebrates competition, fair play, and the pursuit 
        of dreams: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) applauds the athletes and coaches of the United States 
        Olympic and Paralympic Teams and their families who support 
        them;
            (2) supports the athletes of the United States Olympic and 
        Paralympic Teams in their endeavors at the 2016 Olympic and 
        Paralympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;
            (3) thanks the members of the United States Olympics 
        Committee and the National Governing Bodies for Sport for their 
        unwavering support of the athletes of the United States Olympic 
        and Paralympic Teams; and
            (4) supports the goals and ideals of the Olympic Games.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
