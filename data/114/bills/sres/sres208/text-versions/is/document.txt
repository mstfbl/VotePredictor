 Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the requested release of 
 convicted terrorist Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda, also known 
 as ``Simon Trinidad'', from prison in the United States as a part of 
                      the Colombian peace process.

Whereas the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (Fuerzas 
        Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia--Ejercito del Pueblo (FARC-EP) is a 
        Marxist insurgency group engaged in a bloody civil war with the 
        Government of Colombia;
Whereas FARC-EP has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the 
        Department of State since 1997;
Whereas fighting between FARC-EP and the Government of Colombia has claimed 
        hundreds of thousands of lives, including United States citizens, since 
        1964;
Whereas multiple FARC-EP terrorists have been indicted, captured, and extradited 
        to the United States to face trial for their crimes against United 
        States citizens;
Whereas Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda, also known as ``Simon Trinidad'', 
        joined FARC in the 1980s and later became a rebel leader within the 
        FARC-EP;
Whereas, on February 13, 2003, a small Cessna airplane carrying 5 people 
        including a United States pilot named Thomas Janis, a Colombian 
        national, Luis Cruz, and 3 other United States nationals, Marc 
        Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Thomas Howes, crashed in Southern 
        Colombia;
Whereas heavily armed FARC-EP guerrillas immediately surrounded the plane and 
        brutally executed Thomas Janis and Luis Cruz, then took the other men 
        hostage;
Whereas, on April 27, 2003, the FARC-EP issued a communique taking credit for 
        the abduction of the three United States nationals, made demands in 
        exchange for the release of the hostages, and appointed ``Simon 
        Trinidad'' the spokesperson and negotiator for the FARC-EP;
Whereas ``Simon Trinidad'' was captured in Ecuador's capital of Quito 8 months 
        later on January 2, 2004;
Whereas ``Simon Trinidad'' was convicted by a court in Colombia for aggravated 
        kidnapping and rebellion and sentenced to 35 years in prison on May 4, 
        2004;
Whereas ``Simon Trinidad'' was convicted by a United States jury of plotting to 
        hold 3 United States nationals hostage after they were captured in 
        Colombia, and was sentenced to 60 years in prison on January 28, 2008; 
        and
Whereas FARC-EP has reportedly named ``Simon Trinidad'' a member of their 
        Colombian peace negotiating team and made a request for President Barack 
        Obama to release him: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) opposes the FARC-EP's requested release of Juvenal 
        Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda, also known as ``Simon 
        Trinidad'', who was convicted by a United States jury of 
        plotting to hold 3 United States nationals hostage after they 
        were captured in Colombia, and was sentenced to 60 years in 
        prison;
            (2) extends deepest sympathies to all family members of the 
        victims of FARC-EP atrocities; and
            (3) recognizes this type of action would send a negative 
        message to terrorist groups and undermines the United States 
        judicial system.
