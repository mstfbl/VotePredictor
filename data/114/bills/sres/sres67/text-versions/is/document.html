    The second undesignated subparagraph of paragraph 2 of rule XXII of 
the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended by striking ``And if that 
question'' and all that follows through ``disposed of.'' and inserting 
the following: ``If the question is decided in the affirmative in the 
case of a nomination on the Executive Calendar by a majority of the 
Senators duly chosen and sworn; in the case of a measure or motion to 
amend the Senate rules by two-thirds of the Senators present and 
voting; and in the case of any other measure, motion, or matter, by 
three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn, then the foregoing 
measure, motion or matter pending before the Senate, or the unfinished 
business, upon which the question was decided in the affirmative shall 
be the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until 
disposed of.''.
