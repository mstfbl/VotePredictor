                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week of May 10 through May 16, 2015, as ``National 
                             Police Week''.

Whereas, in 1962, John Fitzgerald Kennedy signed the Joint Resolution entitled 
        ``Joint Resolution to authorize the President to proclaim May 15 of each 
        year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week of each year 
        during which such May 15 occurs as Police Week'' (36 U.S.C. 136);
Whereas law enforcement officers are charged with pursuing justice and 
        protecting communities in the United States;
Whereas Federal, State, local, and tribal police officers, sheriffs, and other 
        law enforcement officers across the United States serve with dignity and 
        integrity;
Whereas, in 2015, on the 20th anniversary of the Oklahoma City Murrah Federal 
        Building bombing, the Senate honors the memory of those who perished in 
        the bombing and the role of law enforcement officers as both first 
        responders to terrorist attacks and protectors of the homeland from 
        foreign and domestic threats;
Whereas law enforcement officers selflessly serve their communities even at the 
        risk of their own personal safety, including the abhorrent murders of 
        New York Police Department Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu;
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day honors all law enforcement officers killed 
        in the line of duty;
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 2015, honors 127 law enforcement officers 
        recently killed in the line of duty, including David T. Johnson, Terry 
        B. Fisher, Clinton Jeffrey Holtz, Carlos A. Rivera-Vega, Thomas A.

        Stewart, Stephen Petruzzello, Thomas Choi, James E. Foster, Jr., and 
        Timothy Mitchell; and
Whereas 44 law enforcement officers across the United States have made the 
        ultimate sacrifice during the first 4 months of 2015: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of May 10 through May 16, 2015, as 
        ``National Police Week'';
            (2) expresses strong support for law enforcement officers 
        across the United States for their efforts to build safer and 
        more secure communities;
            (3) recognizes the need to ensure that law enforcement 
        officers have the equipment, training, and resources necessary 
        to protect their health and safety while the law enforcement 
        officers are protecting the public;
            (4) recognizes the members of the law enforcement community 
        for their selfless acts of bravery;
            (5) acknowledges that police officers and other law 
        enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
        should be remembered and honored; and
            (6) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
        that promote awareness of the vital role of law enforcement 
        officers in building safer and more secure communities across 
        the United States.
