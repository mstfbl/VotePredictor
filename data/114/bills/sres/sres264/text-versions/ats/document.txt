                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 22, 2015

 Ms. Collins (for herself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating September 23, 2015, as ``National Falls Prevention 
  Awareness Day'' to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of 
                       falls among older adults.

Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and older, are the fastest-growing segment 
        of the population in the United States;
Whereas the number of older adults in the United States will increase from 
        35,000,000 in 2000 to 82,300,000 in 2040;
Whereas 1 out of 3 adults over age 65 in the United States falls each year;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries among 
        older adults;
Whereas, in 2013, approximately 2,500,000 older adults were treated in hospital 
        emergency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 734,000 
        were subsequently hospitalized;
Whereas, in 2013, more than 25,500 older adults died from injuries related to 
        unintentional falls, and the death rates from falls among older adults 
        in the United States have risen sharply in the last decade;
Whereas, in 2013, the total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for 
        older adults, adjusted for inflation, was $34,000,000,000;
Whereas if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, the annual cost of fall 
        injuries will reach $67,700,000,000 by 2020; and
Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing falls by utilizing 
        cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs to improve balance 
        and strength, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of 
        home hazards, and fall prevention education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 23, 2015, as ``National Falls 
        Prevention Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls 
        prevention programs and policies;
            (3) commends the 72 member organizations of the Falls Free 
        Coalition and the falls prevention coalitions in 43 States and 
        the District of Columbia for their efforts to work together to 
        increase education and awareness about preventing falls among 
        older adults;
            (4) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
        local governments, the public health community, and health care 
        providers to work together to raise awareness of falls in an 
        effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults in 
        the United States;
            (5) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
        continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent 
        falls among older adults that will translate into effective 
        community-based falls prevention programs;
            (6) urges the Administration for Community Living, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and partners to 
        continue to promote evidence-based programs and services in 
        communities across the United States to reduce the number of 
        older adults at risk for falls;
            (7) encourages State health departments and State Units on 
        Aging, which provide significant leadership in reducing 
        injuries and related health care costs by collaborating with 
        organizations and individuals, to reduce falls among older 
        adults; and
            (8) encourages experts in the field of falls prevention to 
        share their best practices so that their success can be 
        replicated by others.
