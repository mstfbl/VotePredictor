      Designating September 25, 2015, as ``National Lobster Day''.

Whereas lobster from the United States is recognized around the world as a 
        prized culinary delicacy;
Whereas lobster fishing has served as an economic engine and a family tradition 
        in the United States for centuries;
Whereas thousands of families in the United States make their livelihoods from 
        lobster fishing and processing;
Whereas more than 120,000,000 pounds of lobster are caught each year in waters 
        of the United States, representing one of the Nation's most valuable 
        catches;
Whereas the lobster industry is booming abroad, with profits climbing from 
        $335,800,000 in 2009 to $738,600,000 in 2014;
Whereas historical lore notes that lobster likely joined turkey on the table at 
        the very first Thanksgiving Day feast in 1621;
Whereas responsible lobstering practices, beginning in the 1600s, have created 
        one of the world's most sustainable fisheries;
Whereas Lobster Newburg was featured on the menu at the inaugural dinner 
        celebration for President John F. Kennedy;
Whereas lobsters are one of the most healthy and nutritious sources of protein;
Whereas the peak of the lobstering season in the United States occurs in the 
        late summer;
Whereas lobster has become a culinary icon, with the lobster roll being featured 
        at the 2015 World Food Expo in Milan, Italy; and
Whereas lobster is featured on more and more restaurant menus, growing by 35 
        percent from 2009 to 2013: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 25, 2015, as ``National Lobster 
        Day''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
