        area of operations of the United States Central Command since the 
        September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;
Whereas the United States is kept strong and free by the loyal military 
        personnel from the total force (the regular components, the National 
        Guard, and the Reserves), who protect the precious heritage of the 
        United States through their declarations and actions;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces serving at home and abroad have courageously 
        answered the call to duty to defend the ideals of the United States and 
        to preserve peace and freedom around the world;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces personify the virtues of patriotism, 
        service, duty, courage, and sacrifice;
Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces make important and 
        significant sacrifices for the United States; and
Whereas the Senate designated October 26 as ``Day of the Deployed'' in 2011, 
        2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015: Now, therefore, be it

            (3) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on

        members serve, past, present, and future; and

        the Day of the Deployed with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities.
