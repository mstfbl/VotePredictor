Whereas, in 1916, Ernest Holmes built the first twin boom wrecker in 
        Chattanooga, Tennessee, for use in his own garage and later agreed to 
        build and sell the units to others;
Whereas the first production wreckers were known as ``680's'' because they cost 
        $680;
Whereas, in service to the United States, the Ernest Holmes Company supplied the 
        W-45 military wrecker for use during World War II;
Whereas, in 1959, the Ernest Holmes Company patented its first tow sling and car 
        dolly;
Whereas, in the early 1970's, Gerald Holmes built the first hydraulic towing 
        equipment, an advancement in the industry;
Whereas, in 1995, the International Towing & Recovery Hall of Fame & Museum 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Museum'') was established in 
        Chattanooga, Tennessee, the birthplace of the tow truck;
Whereas, in 2003, the Museum, having outgrown its original home, moved to 3315 
        Broad Street in Chattanooga;
Whereas, in 2006, the Museum officially dedicated the Wall of the Fallen, the 
        first monument in the industry to honor towing operators killed in the 
        line of service;
Whereas, in the United States, there are more than 35,000 tow companies and 
        hundreds of thousands of individuals employed in the towing industry, 
        including tow truck operators, dispatchers, safety advisors, and owners;
Whereas more than 1 tow truck operator is killed every 6 days assisting 
        motorists on the roadways of the United States;
Whereas tow truck operators respond to nearly 15,000,000 accidents per year 
        across the United States;
Whereas tow truck operators are an indispensable part of keeping the United 
        States moving by keeping the highways of the United States clear and 
        open for travel;
Whereas most highway crashes require assistance from tow truck operators; and
Whereas the people of the United States have a duty to drive safely and be 
        courteous toward fellow motorists on the roadways as the people of the 
        United States work together toward the common goal of reducing fatal 
        accidents: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the tow truck;

        Fame & Museum Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony and the Wall of 
        the Fallen ceremony, each of which is held annually at the 
        International Towing & Recovery Hall of Fame & Museum in 
        Chattanooga, Tennessee; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States--
                    (A) to observe the move over and slow down laws in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) to join in the worthy observance of National 
                Towing Industry Awareness Week.
