                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commemorating the 75\th\ anniversary of the Virginia Institute of 
            Marine Science of the College of William & Mary.

Whereas the Virginia General Assembly, with Professor Donald W. Davis of the 
        College of William & Mary, envisioned a center for marine research and 
        education in the Commonwealth of Virginia;
Whereas the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (referred to in this preamble 
        as ``VIMS''), originally known as the Virginia Fisheries Laboratory, 
        began operation in 1940;
Whereas the early work of VIMS assured the future of the fishery industry in 
        Virginia by improving the general knowledge of the resources of 
        fisheries so that they might be properly conserved and managed, and by 
        meeting the need for training in practical marine biology;
Whereas VIMS is now the home of the School of Marine Sciences of the College of 
        William & Mary, a university research and teaching center with a strong 
        element of public service, and is the leading marine center that focuses 
        on estuarine and coastal environments in the nation; and
Whereas VIMS continues to serve the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United 
        States by advancing the frontiers of marine science and sharing the 
        knowledge gained through research with the users and stewards of the 
        environment and future scientists: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the College of William & Mary and the 
        Virginia Institute of Marine Science on the 75\th\ anniversary 
        of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science; and
            (2) expresses appreciation for the 75 years of service to 
        the environment by the faculty, staff, and students of the 
        Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the School of Marine 
        Sciences of the College of William & Mary.
                                 <all>
