                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            December 7, 2015

    Mr. Coons (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Kaine, and Mr. Perdue) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
                          on Foreign Relations

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet for winning the 
                        2015 Nobel Peace Prize.

Whereas, on October 10, 2015, the Norwegian Nobel Committee (referred to in this 
        Resolution as ``the Committee'') awarded the Tunisian National Dialogue 
        Quartet (referred to in this Resolution as ``the Quartet'') the 2015 
        Nobel Peace Prize for its work in building on the promise of the 2011 
        Jasmine Revolution and preventing Tunisia's democratic transition from 
        descending into violence in 2013;
Whereas the Jasmine Revolution in January 2011 was the spark that led to the 
        Arab Spring protests across the Middle East and North Africa, ultimately 
        leading to the departure of President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali and the 
        end of his authoritarian rule;
Whereas the Quartet is a coalition of 4 civil society organizations: The 
        Tunisian General Labor Union; The Tunisian Confederation of Industry, 
        Trade, and Handicrafts; The Tunisian Human Rights League; and The 
        Tunisian Order of Lawyers;
Whereas the Quartet offered a path away from violence, political assassinations, 
        and civil unrest by promoting mediation and a peaceful political process 
        led by civil society actors committed to the rule of law and human 
        rights;
Whereas an elected National Constituent Assembly adopted a new, progressive 
        constitution in early 2014, and Tunisia held peaceful and fair elections 
        in late 2014, formally ending a series of transitional governments;
Whereas in response to the March 18, 2015, terrorist attack on the Bardo 
        National Museum that killed 21 people, Tunisian citizens and political 
        leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to dialogue, pluralism, and 
        democracy;
Whereas a terrorist attack on July 26, 2015, on a beach in the town of Sousse, 
        left 38 people, including 30 British nationals, dead, and dealt a blow 
        to tourism in Tunisia, an important industry upon which the Tunisian 
        economy depends;
Whereas President Barack Obama stated on October 9, 2015, ``With the Quartet's 
        support, Tunisians voted in free elections, forged a new constitution 
        that upholds human rights and equality for all people, including women 
        and minorities, and formed a national unity government, including 
        secular and Islamist parties, showing that democracy and Islam can 
        indeed thrive together.'';
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry stated on October 9, 2015, ``The Tunisian 
        model of inclusivity and respecting fundamental freedoms of all its 
        citizens is the best answer to the violence and extremist ideologies 
        that have torn apart other countries in the region'';
Whereas Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi stated on October 9, 2015, that the 
        Nobel Peace Prize signified ``a tribute not only to the Quartet and its 
        organizations but is also a crowning of the principle of consensual 
        solutions adopted by Tunisia'';
Whereas the Norwegian Nobel Committee stated on October 10, 2015, ``The broad-
        based national dialogue that the Quartet succeeded in establishing 
        countered the spread of violence in Tunisia . . . the prize is intended 
        as an encouragement to the Tunisian people, who despite major challenges 
        have laid the groundwork for a national fraternity which the Committee 
        hopes will serve as an example to be followed by other countries'';
Whereas Tunisia continues to face serious threats to its security from violent 
        extremist groups operating within Tunisia as well as in neighboring 
        countries;
Whereas a terrorist attack on November 24, 2015, on Tunisia's Presidential Guard 
        killed 12 people and represents another effort to undermine democracy 
        and stability in Tunisia;
Whereas Tunisia faces economic challenges, including high inflation and high 
        unemployment, especially among young Tunisians;
Whereas the United States is committed to continuing a strong economic 
        partnership with Tunisia as it undertakes reforms to transform its 
        economy to meet the aspirations of all of its citizens;
Whereas the United States and Tunisia have enjoyed friendly relations for more 
        than 200 years;
Whereas in accordance with the United States-Tunisia Strategic Partnership, both 
        countries are dedicated to working together to promote economic 
        development and business opportunities in Tunisia, education for the 
        advancement of long-term development in Tunisia, and increased security 
        cooperation to address common threats in Tunisia and across the region;
Whereas in July 2015, President Obama designated Tunisia a Major Non-NATO Ally;
Whereas Tunisia is a member of the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State 
        of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL);
Whereas at the second United States-Tunisia Strategic Dialogue in November 2015, 
        Secretary Kerry reaffirmed the historic friendship and growing strategic 
        partnership between the United States and Tunisia and praised the role 
        of civil society organizations in Tunisia's democratic transition;
Whereas the United States Government allocated approximately $580,000,000 in 
        foreign assistance during fiscal years 2011 through 2014, which is 10 
        times the bilateral assistance appropriated for Tunisia during the 
        previous 4 fiscal years;
Whereas the President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2016 included a 
        substantial increase in bilateral assistance to support Tunisia's 
        democratic transition;
Whereas it is in America's interest to see that a pluralist democracy and a 
        vibrant economy develop in Tunisia;
Whereas the United States should provide a level of funding to strongly assist 
        and reinforce Tunisia's transition to democracy, stability, and 
        prosperity:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet on 
        winning the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize;
            (2) commends the leaders of The Tunisian General Labor 
        Union; The Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade, and 
        Handicrafts; The Tunisian Human Rights League; and The Tunisian 
        Order of Lawyers for negotiating solutions to political crises;
            (3) commends Tunisian political leaders for their 
        willingness to compromise and work together in the interest of 
        the Tunisian people;
            (4) encourages the Government of Tunisia to build upon its 
        successes and move swiftly to implement necessary political and 
        economic reforms that will benefit the Tunisian people and 
        consolidate Tunisia's democratic transition; and
            (5) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to 
        support the Government of Tunisia and its people as they 
        continue on the path to democracy and fulfill their desire for 
        a stable and prosperous country.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
