                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the designation of May 2016 as ``Mental Health Month''.

Whereas mental health and the emotional well-being of individuals in the United 
        States are foundational issues that affect individual, family, and 
        community quality of life and economic prosperity;
Whereas studies note that individuals with serious mental illness die, on 
        average, 25 years earlier than individuals in the general population;
Whereas individuals with mental illness, behavioral health disorders, or co-
        occurring substance use disorders can recover through treatment that 
        includes psychosocial therapy, clinical treatment, and peer support, 
        alone or in combination with behavioral, psychiatric, psychological, or 
        integrated medical services;
Whereas prevention strategies can prevent or delay the onset of many mental 
        health conditions;
Whereas recovery-oriented interventions such as supported employment, supported 
        housing, and supported education have been shown to improve outcomes for 
        individuals with mental illness;
Whereas mental illness impacts individuals across the United States and in every 
        walk of life;
Whereas nearly 44,000,000 adults in the United States live with mental illness 
        and 20 percent of children and adolescents have a diagnosable mental 
        health disorder;
Whereas 1 in 25 individuals in the United States has lived with a serious mental 
        illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression;
Whereas approximately \1/2\ of students age 14 or older with a mental illness 
        drop out of school and 70 percent of adolescents in the juvenile justice 
        system have a mental illness;
Whereas the average delay from the onset of symptoms of mental illness to 
        therapeutic intervention for teens is between 8 and 10 years;
Whereas suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States and 
        leads to the death of more than 41,000 individuals in the United States 
        each year;
Whereas negative perception and stigma continue to be associated with mental 
        illness, which contributes to individuals not seeking needed care;
Whereas nearly 15 percent of men and 31 percent of women in jails have a serious 
        mental illness, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar 
        disorder; and
Whereas it would be appropriate to observe May 2016 as ``Mental Health Month'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Mental Health Month'' to 
        reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and to 
        encourage individuals to seek care;
            (2) recognizes that mental well-being is critically 
        important and linked to the well-being of individuals, 
        communities, and the economy in the United States;
            (3) supports the integration of national and local 
        community efforts to promote public awareness of mental health 
        and to support individuals and families affected by mental 
        illness; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to view 
        ``Mental Health Month'' as a chance to promote mental health 
        wellness, to ensure access to services, and to improve the 
        quality of life of individuals living with mental illness.
