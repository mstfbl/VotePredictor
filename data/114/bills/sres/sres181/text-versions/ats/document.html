                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating May 19, 2015, as ``National Schizencephaly Awareness Day''.

Whereas schizencephaly is an extremely rare developmental birth defect 
        characterized by abnormal slits, or clefts, in the brain;
Whereas individuals with bilateral schizencephaly, the more severe case, 
        commonly have developmental delays, delays in speech and language 
        skills, problems with brain-spinal cord communication, limited mobility, 
        and shorter lifespans;
Whereas schizencephaly is the second rarest brain malformation, and only 
        approximately 7,000 cases have ever been reported;
Whereas promoting education and increasing awareness among health professionals 
        and families will lead to early intervention and treatment options for 
        individuals with schizencephaly; and
Whereas continued Federal support for medical research will help identify 
        causes, improve diagnostics, and develop promising treatments for 
        schizencephaly: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates May 19, 2015, as ``National 
Schizencephaly Awareness Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
