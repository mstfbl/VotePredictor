                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the New England Patriots on their victory in Super Bowl 
                                 XLIX.

Whereas on Sunday, February 1, 2015, the New England Patriots won Super Bowl 
        XLIX with a score of 28 to 24, defeating the Seattle Seahawks in 
        Glendale, Arizona;
Whereas Malcolm Butler's goal line interception with 20 seconds remaining in the 
        game clinched the Super Bowl XLIX Championship for the New England 
        Patriots;
Whereas the Super Bowl XLIX victory is the fourth Super Bowl Championship for 
        the New England Patriots;
Whereas quarterback Tom Brady broke, tied, or extended 9 Super Bowl records in 
        leading the New England Patriots to their fourth Super Bowl victory and 
        was named the ``Super Bowl Most Valuable Player'' for the third time;
Whereas Head Coach Bill Belichick, Coordinators Matt Patricia and Josh 
        McDaniels, and the staff of the New England Patriots brilliantly created 
        successful game plans throughout the 2014 season;
Whereas extraordinary efforts by players of the New England Patriots, including 
        Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, Brandon LaFell, Danny 
        Amendola, Shane Vereen, LeGarrette Blount, Darrelle Revis, Chandler 
        Jones, Jamie Collins, Vince Wilfork, Rob Ninkovich, Devin McCourty, 
        Don'ta Hightower, Sealver Siliga, Alan Branch, Ryan Allen, Stephen 
        Gostkowski, Brandon Browner, Matthew Slater, and Malcolm Butler, 
        significantly contributed to the Super Bowl XLIX victory;
Whereas the offensive line of the New England Patriots was crucial to their 
        victory in Super Bowl XLIX, and strong efforts by Nate Solder, Sebastian 
        Vollmer, Bryan Stork, Ryan Wendell, Dan Connolly, and Cameron Fleming 
        resulted in the New England Patriots conceding only one sack out of the 
        51 times quarterback Tom Brady dropped back to pass during Super Bowl 
        XLIX;
Whereas Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, deserves great 
        credit for his unwavering commitment and leadership, and for his 
        gracious acknowledgment that the team's Super Bowl Championship would 
        not have been possible without the strong support of the millions of 
        fans who comprise ``Patriots Nation''; and
Whereas all members of the New England Patriots ``did their job'' to help 
        deliver a fourth Vince Lombardi Trophy to New England and are now ``on 
        to the White House'' to celebrate their victory: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the New England Patriots on 
their dramatic Super Bowl XLIX victory.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
