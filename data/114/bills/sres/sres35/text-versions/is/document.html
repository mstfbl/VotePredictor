                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz 
              extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland.

Whereas, on January 27, 1945, the Auschwitz extermination camp in Nazi-occupied 
        Poland was liberated by Allied Forces during World War II after almost 5 
        years of murder, rape, and torture at the camp;
Whereas 1,100,000 innocent civilians were murdered at the Auschwitz 
        extermination camp;
Whereas nearly 1,300,000 innocent civilians were deported to Auschwitz from 
        their homes across Eastern and Western Europe, particularly from 
        Hungary, Poland, and France;
Whereas 1,000,000 of the civilians who perished at the camp were Jews, along 
        with 100,000 non-Jewish Poles, Roma and Sinti individuals, Soviet 
        prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, gay men and women, and other 
        ethnic minorities;
Whereas these civilians included farmers, tailors, seamstresses, factory hands, 
        accountants, doctors, teachers, small-business owners, clergy, 
        intellectuals, government officials, and political activists;
Whereas these civilians were subjected to torture, forced labor, starvation, 
        rape, medical experiments, and being separated from loved ones;
Whereas the names of many of these civilians who perished have been lost 
        forever;
Whereas the Auschwitz extermination camp symbolizes the extraordinary brutality 
        of the Holocaust;
Whereas the people of the United States must never forget the terrible crimes 
        against humanity committed at the Auschwitz extermination camp;
Whereas the people of the United States must educate future generations to 
        promote understanding of the dangers of intolerance in order to prevent 
        similar injustices from happening again; and
Whereas commemoration of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp will 
        instill in all people of the United States a greater awareness of the 
        Holocaust: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates January 27, 2015, as the 70th anniversary 
        of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp by Allied 
        Forces during World War II;
            (2) calls on all people of the United States to remember 
        the 1,100,000 innocent victims murdered at the Auschwitz 
        extermination camp as part of the Holocaust;
            (3) honors the legacy of the survivors of the Holocaust and 
        of the Auschwitz extermination camp; and
            (4) calls on the people of the United States to continue to 
        work toward tolerance, peace, and justice and to end all 
        genocide and persecution.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
