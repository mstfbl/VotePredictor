_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of April 2015, as ``Parkinson's Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disease and 
        is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United 
        States;
Whereas there is inadequate data on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's 
        disease, but the disease affects an estimated 500,000 to 1,500,000 
        individuals in the United States;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Parkinson's 
        disease is the 14th leading cause of death in the United States;
Whereas every day Parkinson's disease greatly impacts millions of individuals in 
        the United States who are caregivers, family members, and friends of 
        individuals with Parkinson's disease;
Whereas the economic burden of Parkinson's disease is an estimated 
        $14,400,000,000 each year, including indirect costs to patients and 
        family members of $6,300,000,000 each year;
Whereas although research suggests that the cause of Parkinson's disease is a 
        combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and 
        exact progression of the disease remain unknown;
Whereas an objective test or biomarker for diagnosing Parkinson's disease does 
        not exist;
Whereas a cure or drug to slow or halt the progression of Parkinson's disease 
        does not exist;
Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to person and 
        include tremors, slowness of movement, rigidity, difficulty with 
        balance, swallowing, chewing, and speaking, cognitive impairment, 
        dementia, mood disorders, and a variety of other non-motor symptoms;
Whereas volunteers, researchers, caregivers, and medical professionals are 
        working to improve the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson's 
        disease and the families of those individuals; and
Whereas developing more effective treatments for Parkinson's disease and 
        providing access to quality care to individuals with Parkinson's disease 
        requires increased research, education, and community support services: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 2015, as ``Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``Parkinson's 
        Awareness Month'';
            (3) continues to support research to develop more effective 
        treatments for Parkinson's disease and to ultimately find a 
        cure for the disease;
            (4) recognizes the individuals with Parkinson's disease who 
        participate in vital clinical trials to advance the knowledge 
        of the disease; and
            (5) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, 
        researchers, and millions of individuals in the United States 
        working to improve the quality of life for individuals with 
        Parkinson's disease and the families of those individuals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
