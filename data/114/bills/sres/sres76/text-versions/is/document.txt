                               RESOLUTION


 
  Welcoming the Prime Minister of Israel to the United States for his 
                address to a joint session of Congress.

Whereas, since its founding in 1948, Israel has been a strong and steadfast ally 
        to the United States in the Middle East, a region characterized by 
        instability and violence;
Whereas the United States-Israel relationship is built on mutual respect for 
        common values, including a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, 
        individual liberty, free-market principles, and ethnic and religious 
        diversity;
Whereas the strong cultural, religious, and political ties shared by the United 
        States and Israel help form a bond between our countries that should 
        never be broken;
Whereas Israel continues to serve as a shining model of democratic values by 
        regularly holding free and fair elections, promoting the free exchange 
        of ideas, and vigorously exercising a form of democratic government that 
        is fully representative of its citizens;
Whereas nations such as Iran and Syria, as well as designated foreign terrorist 
        organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas, refuse to recognize Israel's 
        right to exist, continually call for its destruction, and have 
        repeatedly attacked Israel either directly or through proxies;
Whereas, in particular, the Government of Iran's ongoing pursuit of nuclear 
        weapons poses a tremendous threat both to the United States and Israel;
Whereas the negotiations between the so-called P5+1 countries and Iran over its 
        illicit nuclear weapons program are entering a key phase, and Congress 
        has heard the perspectives, both publicly and privately, of a number of 
        close allies involved in the negotiations; and
Whereas the United States is committed to ensuring that Israel, as a strong and 
        trusted ally, maintains its qualitative military edge: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) warmly welcomes the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin 
        Netanyahu, on his visit to the United States, which provides a 
        timely opportunity to reinforce the United States-Israel 
        relationship;
            (2) eagerly awaits the address of Prime Minister Netanyahu 
        before a joint session of the United States Congress;
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to stand with Israel during 
        times of uncertainty;
            (4) continues to strongly support Israel's right to defend 
        itself from threats to its very survival; and
            (5) reaffirms its unequivocal and bipartisan support for 
        the friendship between the people and Governments of the United 
        States and Israel.
                                 <all>
