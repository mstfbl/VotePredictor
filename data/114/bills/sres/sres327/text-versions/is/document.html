                               RESOLUTION


 
         Condemning violence that targets healthcare for women.

Whereas the constitutional right of the people of the United States to make 
        healthcare decisions about their own bodies was established more than 43 
        years ago;
Whereas in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), the Supreme Court confirmed 
        the constitutional right of all men and women to legally access birth 
        control;
Whereas the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), 42 years ago 
        and reaffirmed that women have a constitutional right to comprehensive 
        reproductive healthcare;
Whereas for decades, healthcare providers for women and people who access 
        healthcare services for women have been subjected to intimidation, 
        threats, and violence;
Whereas since 1993, there have been 11 murders and numerous attempted murders of 
        individuals associated with care provided at health centers for women;
Whereas since 1977--

    (1) nearly 7,000 violent acts have been reported against providers at 
health centers for women, including bombings, arsons, death threats, 
kidnappings, and assaults; and

    (2) more than 190,000 acts of disruption, including bomb threats and 
harassing calls, have been reported;

Whereas between June and December 2015, arson, vandalism, and threats have 
        increased at Planned Parenthood health centers and other health centers 
        for women, including--

    (1) health centers in--

    G    (A) Aurora, Illinois;

    G    (B) Pullman, Washington;

    G    (C) Louisville, Kentucky; and

    G    (D) Claremont, New Hampshire; and

    (2) on November 27, 2015, an attack by a gunman at a Planned Parenthood 
health center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which 3 people were killed 
and 9 people were injured;

Whereas extreme and demonizing rhetoric contributes to a climate that is 
        dangerous for individuals who provide or access comprehensive healthcare 
        services;
Whereas since more than 40 percent of the patients of Planned Parenthood are 
        people of color, people of color are disproportionately impacted by 
        attacks on health centers for women; and
Whereas over their lifetimes, 1 in 5 women in the United States will access 
        healthcare at Planned Parenthood, which--

    (1) in 2013 provided--

    G    (A) over 1,400,000 emergency contraception kits;

    G    (B) nearly 4,500,000 tests and treatments for sexually transmitted 
infections; and

    G    (C) nearly 900,000 cervical cancer screenings and breast exams;

    (2) continues to be the leading reproductive healthcare provider in the 
United States; and

    (3) along with many other reproductive health providers, continues to 
provide expert, quality reproductive healthcare in safe and supportive 
environments across the country: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) denounces the attacks on healthcare centers for women, 
        providers of healthcare for women, and patients; and
            (2) affirms that all women have the right to access 
        reproductive healthcare services without fear of violence, 
        intimidation, or harassment.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
