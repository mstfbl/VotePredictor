  Expressing support for designation of the week of October 9, 2016, 
          through October 15, 2016, as ``Earth Science Week''.

Whereas 2016 marks the 19th annual international Earth Science Week, designated 
        by the American Geosciences Institute to help the public gain a better 
        understanding of and appreciation for the Earth sciences and to 
        encourage stewardship of the Earth;
Whereas the theme of Earth Science Week for 2016, ``Our Shared Geoheritage'', 
        promotes better understanding and appreciation of sites or areas with 
        geologic features of significant scientific, educational, cultural, 
        historic, or aesthetic value;
Whereas the study of the Earth sciences leads to an improved understanding of 
        the Earth's natural systems and the interplay between human society and 
        those systems;
Whereas the Earth sciences enable the discovery, development, and responsible 
        production of the mineral base of the United States, which contributes 
        to the strength of the economy of the United States and raises the 
        standard of living in the United States;
Whereas geologic mapping and remote sensing technologies provide the 
        foundational knowledge of Earth's natural systems that is integral--

    (1) to the discovery, development, and conservation of energy, water, 
and natural resources; and

    (2) to the safe disposal of waste products;

Whereas the geological aspects of resources, hazards, and the environment are 
        vital to land management and land use decisions at the local, State, 
        regional, national, and international levels;
Whereas the Earth sciences provide the basis for locating, assessing, 
        monitoring, and mitigating natural hazards, such as earthquakes, 
        landslides, floods, droughts, wildfires, subsidence, hurricanes, coastal 
        erosion, and volcanic eruptions;
Whereas the Earth sciences are vital in protecting health and human safety 
        during natural hazards events;
Whereas Earth scientists working in marine environments contribute to the 
        understanding of global oceans, enabling advances in food management, 
        national security, energy resources, transportation, economic growth, 
        and recreation;
Whereas the Earth sciences support the ability to manage healthy and productive 
        soils and ocean and river waters and fisheries, the foundations of the 
        food supply of the United States;
Whereas the Earth sciences enhance understanding of current and past global 
        conditions and offer a basis for anticipating future conditions;
Whereas the Earth sciences contribute to understanding Earth as a planet in the 
        solar system and the universe;
Whereas Earth science research leads to the development of innovative new 
        technologies and industries that fuel the economy of the United States 
        and improve quality of life in the United States;
Whereas Earth science researchers and educators drive creativity and passion for 
        the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (commonly known as 
        ``STEM'') fields among students of all ages through diverse and 
        innovative education and public outreach efforts;
Whereas geoscientists and researchers in the labs, universities, research 
        institutions, and Federal agencies of the United States continually push 
        the frontiers of human knowledge, help develop and incubate the concepts 
        and programs that keep the companies and industries of the United States 
        at the innovative forefront of the world's economy, and inspire future 
        generations of researchers, scientists, and informed citizens; and
Whereas the Earth sciences make vital contributions to an understanding of and 
        respect for nature and the Earth: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of the week of October 9, 
        2016, through October 15, 2016, as ``Earth Science Week'';
            (2) expresses strong support for the goals and ideals of 
        Earth Science Week to increase the understanding of and 
        interest in the Earth sciences at the local, State, national, 
        and international levels;
            (3) recognizes the importance of education and public 
        outreach efforts to ensure that the people of the United States 
        gain a better understanding of and appreciation for the impact 
        of the Earth sciences on their daily lives;
            (4) encourages K-12 students--
                    (A) to participate in local, State, and national 
                events in connection with Earth Science Week; and
                    (B) to get involved in the celebration of Earth 
                Science Week by exploring artistic and academic 
                applications of the Earth sciences; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Earth Science Week with appropriate activities--
                    (A) to gain a better understanding of and 
                appreciation for the Earth sciences; and
                    (B) to encourage stewardship of the Earth.
                                 <all>
