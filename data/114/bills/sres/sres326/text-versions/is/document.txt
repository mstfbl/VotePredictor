 Celebrating the 135th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the 
                       United States and Romania.

Whereas the United States established diplomatic relations with Romania in June 
        1880;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Romania strive to continually 
        improve cooperation between government leaders and strengthen the two 
        countries' strategic partnership, focusing on the political-military 
        relationship, law-enforcement collaboration, trade and investment 
        opportunities, and energy security;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Romania are committed to 
        supporting human rights, advancing the rule of law, democratic 
        governance, economic growth, and freedom;
Whereas Romania joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004, 
        and has established itself as a resolute ally of both the United States 
        and strong NATO member;
Whereas the Government of Romania continues to improve its military 
        capabilities, and has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to provide 
        forces and assets in support of operations that address the national 
        security interests of the United States and all NATO members, including 
        deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Kosovo;
Whereas, in 2011, the United States and Romania issued the ``Joint Declaration 
        on Strategic Partnership for the 21st Century Between the United States 
        of America and Romania,'' reflecting increasing cooperation between our 
        countries to promote security, democracy, free market opportunities, and 
        cultural exchange;
Whereas the United States and Romania signed a ballistic missile defense (BMD) 
        agreement in 2011, allowing the deployment of United States personnel, 
        equipment, and anti-missile interceptors to Romania;
Whereas, in October 2014, the United States Navy formally launched Naval Support 
        Facility Deveselu to achieve the goals of the 2011 BMD agreement and 
        thus established the first new United States Navy base since 1987;
Whereas, in September 2015, Romania stood up a NATO Force Integration Unit;
Whereas Romania will host the Alliance's Multinational Division-Southeast 
        headquarters in Bucharest and commits significant resources to the Very 
        High Readiness Joint Task Force;
Whereas Romania has agreed to host components of the United States European 
        Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, which will be 
        operational by the end of 2015; and
Whereas, for the past 25 years, the Government of Romania has shown leadership 
        in advancing stability, security, and democratic principles in Central 
        and Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, and the Black Sea region, 
        especially in the current difficult regional context: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 135th anniversary of United States-
        Romanian diplomatic relations;
            (2) congratulates the people of Romania on their 
        accomplishments as a great nation; and
            (3) expresses appreciation for Romania's unwavering 
        partnership with the United States.
                                 <all>
