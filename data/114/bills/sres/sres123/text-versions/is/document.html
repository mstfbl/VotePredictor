considered by the Senate (other than a resolution described in 
subparagraph (b)) shall be a resolution appointing majority and 
minority members of the Committee on Rules and Administration of the 
Senate and a resolution amending or adopting rules for the proceedings 
of the Senate. No other matter shall be in order, except by unanimous 
consent, until the Senate has agreed to a resolution amending or 
adopting rules for the proceedings of the Senate.
    ``(b) A resolution described in this subparagraph is a resolution--
            ``(1) informing the President that a quorum of each House

            ``(6) electing a Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the 
        Senate and notifying the President and the House of 
        Representatives of such election; or
            ``(7) electing Secretaries for the Majority and Minority of 
        the Senate.
    ``2. At the beginning of a new Congress, and until the Senate has 
agreed to a resolution adopting or amending rules for the proceedings 
of the Senate, if the Committee on Rules and Administration reports to 
the full Senate a resolution amending or adopting rules for the 
proceedings of the Senate, the Senate shall immediately proceed to 
consideration of the resolution.
    ``3. On and after the third day of session of the Senate, if the 
Committee on Rules has not reported to the full Senate a resolution 
amending or adopting rules for the proceedings of the Senate, it shall 
be in order for any Senator to introduce and immediately move to 
proceed to consider a resolution amending or adopting rules for the 
proceedings of the Senate. Consideration of such a motion to proceed, 
including consideration of any motions or appeals in connection 
therewith, shall be limited to 2 hours.
    ``4. On and after the third day of session of the Senate during 
which a resolution amending or adopting rules for the proceedings of 
the Senate is being considered, it shall be in order for any Senator to 
move to end debate on such resolution. Consideration of such motion, 
including consideration of any motion or appeal in connection 
therewith, shall be limited to 2 hours. If such motion is decided in 
the affirmative, the Senate shall proceed immediately to vote on the 
resolution adopting or amending rules for the proceedings of the 
Senate, as amended if such resolution has been amended.''; and
            (3) in paragraph 5 (as redesignated), by striking ``No 
        motion'' and inserting ``Other than at the beginning of a new 
        Congress, no motion''.
