  Commemorating ``Cruise Travel Professional Month'' in October 2016.

Whereas cruise travel professionals support policies and practices that foster a 
        safe, secure, healthy, and sustainable cruise ship environment and are 
        dedicated to promoting the cruise travel experience;
Whereas approximately 10,000 travel agencies and 19,000 individual cruise travel 
        professionals participate in ongoing professional development and 
        training programs to build cruise industry knowledge;
Whereas cruise travel professionals deliver value to consumers by providing 
        advice on choosing the best cruise based on the budgets and interests of 
        the customers and taking the worry out of vacation planning by arranging 
        the details of vacations;
Whereas cruise passengers have consistently ranked cruise travel professionals 
        as the most helpful sources of information and service among all 
        distribution channels used for purchasing cruises;
Whereas 70 percent of cruise passengers from the United States use a cruise 
        travel professional to plan and book a cruise vacation;
Whereas cruise travel professionals across the world celebrate and promote 
        October as ``Plan a Cruise Month'';
Whereas the United States has the most cruise passengers in the world, with 
        almost 11,500,000 cruise passengers in 2014;
Whereas the cruise industry in the United States generated 375,000 jobs across 
        all 50 States in 2014; and
Whereas, in 2014, the cruise industry spent $21,000,000,000 directly with United 
        States businesses and generated $46,000,000,000 in gross outputs due to 
        the spending of cruise lines and the crew and passengers of cruise 
        lines, including indirect economic impacts: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the inaugural ``Cruise Travel Professional

        ceremonies and activities.
