                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing March 3, 2015, as the centennial of the Navy Reserve.

Whereas the roots of patriotic Americans serving in maritime service trace back 
        to even before the existence of the Continental Navy, when residents 
        from seaside towns engaged in combat with British warships in defense of 
        their homes;
Whereas the tradition of maritime service to the country continued through the 
        robust United States merchant marine, and later the formation of State 
        naval militias in the late 19th century to meet the need for additional 
        naval support;
Whereas during the Spanish-American War, the Navy augmented its force with 4,000 
        sailors from the State naval militias;
Whereas the emergence of the United States as a world power in the early 20th 
        century required a more robust and multi-layered naval force;
Whereas the Act of March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. 928, chapter 83), established the 
        Naval Reserve, which became the ``Navy Reserve'' in 2006;
Whereas by the end of World War I, there were 290,0000 members of the Naval 
        Reserve, more than half of the total manpower of the Navy, who fought 
        valiantly during the war;
Whereas 84 percent of the sailors serving in World War II were members of the 
        Naval Reserve, a group that included 100,000 women;
Whereas the more than 2,600,000 enlisted personnel and 269,000 officers in the 
        Naval Reserve in 1945 served in every theater of World War II and on 
        every type of vessel and aircraft;
Whereas 5 Presidents, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, 
        Gerald R. Ford, and George H. W. Bush, served honorably in the Naval 
        Reserve;
Whereas in United States conflicts and national emergencies, including the 
        Berlin Crisis, the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam 
        War, Operation Desert Storm, and hurricanes and other natural disasters, 
        the Navy Reserve has responded to calls promptly and effectively;
Whereas following the attack on the Navy destroyer, USS Cole, on October 12, 
        2000, the Naval Reserve immediately responded with coastal warfare 
        security;
Whereas since the attacks on our homeland of September 11, 2001, the Navy 
        Reserve has mobilized more than 72,000 members of the Navy Reserve 
        worldwide to counter threats to national security;
Whereas the Navy benefits from the military experience, civilian skills, and 
        diverse backgrounds of the members of the Navy Reserve;
Whereas as the Senate recognizes the distinguished service of the members of the 
        Navy Reserve, who are proud individuals of the United States, there are 
        more than 2,000 members of the Navy Reserve deployed around the world; 
        and
Whereas March 3, 2015, marks 100 years since the Act of March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. 
        928, chapter 83), establishing the Naval Reserve: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes March 3, 2015, as the centennial of the Navy 
        Reserve;
            (2) recognizes the indispensable and valuable contributions 
        and sacrifices that individual members of the Navy Reserve have 
        made throughout the history of the United States and continue 
        to make in 2015;
            (3) celebrates the commitment and service of members of the 
        Navy Reserve, their families, and their employers; and
            (4) encourages communities to seize the opportunity to 
        honor and support these patriots in 2015, the centennial of the 
        Navy Reserve.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
