                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the importance of substance use disorder treatment and 
                     recovery in the United States.

Whereas National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month is observed in 
        September of 2016;
Whereas, in 2015, an estimated 17,000,000 individuals in the United States were 
        dependent on, or abused, alcohol;
Whereas substance use disorders are a serious public health threat in the United 
        States, and are associated with--

    (1) mental and physical health conditions;

    (2) lower educational attainment;

    (3) underemployment or unemployment;

    (4) involvement with the criminal justice system;

    (5) victimization and perpetration of violence; and

    (6) homelessness;

Whereas, in 2014, 9.4 percent of adolescents in the United States used illicit 
        drugs during the month before being surveyed;
Whereas young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 have higher rates of alcohol 
        dependence and abuse and illicit substance dependence and abuse as 
        compared to other age groups;
Whereas the rates of alcohol dependence or abuse and illicit substance 
        dependence or abuse are higher among individuals--

    (1) without health insurance;

    (2) living in households with incomes less than 100 percent of the 
Federal poverty level; and

    (3) living in metropolitan areas;

Whereas 90 percent of individuals with alcohol dependence or abuse do not 
        receive, or perceive a need for, treatment for their alcohol use;
Whereas the most recent epidemic of substance use disorders relates to 
        prescription opioids and heroin, and approximately 600 individuals begin 
        using heroin each day;
Whereas overdose deaths from opioids have nearly quadrupled since 1999;
Whereas drug-related suicide attempts leading to emergency department visits 
        have increased by 51 percent since 2005;
Whereas 23,500,000 individuals in the United States are in recovery from 
        substance use disorders;
Whereas the stigma associated with substance use disorders is an additional 
        barrier to people of the United States who strive toward recovery every 
        day;
Whereas substance use treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing 
        substance use, and can produce positive outcomes for individuals; and
Whereas there is a nationwide need for--

    (1) increased education regarding substance use;

    (2) increased access to substance use treatment; and

    (3) increased attention to reducing substance use stigma: Now, 
therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the importance of National Alcohol and Drug 
        Addiction Recovery Month;
            (2) affirms the continued need of the United States to 
        provide resources for substance use education, treatment, and 
        research; and
            (3) honors the significant achievements of people of the 
        United States who are in recovery from substance use disorders.
                                 <all>
