                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 70th anniversary of White Sands Missile Range in New 
  Mexico and commemorating the unique place in history, and national 
                   security importance, of the range.

Whereas on September 26, 1945, White Sands Missile Range (at that time, known as 
        ``White Sands Proving Ground'') launched its first rocket, a Tiny Tim 
        Boomer, setting in motion 7 decades of world-renowned development, 
        testing, and launches at White Sands Missile Range;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range exists as the premier research, development, 
        test, and evaluation facility for the United States and excels in 
        supporting missile development and a diversity of other test programs 
        for the Army, Navy, Air Force, National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration, other government agencies, and private industry;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range employs more than 13,000 civilians and 
        honorable members of the Armed Forces, representing the Army, Navy, and 
        Air Force;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range is recognized as the ``Birthplace of America's 
        Missile and Space Activity'' and holds a unique place in history as the 
        site of the first atomic bomb testing, a site that later became known as 
        the ``Trinity Site National Historic Landmark'';
Whereas White Sands Missile Range remains the largest overland military test 
        range in the United States, occupying 3,200 square miles of southern New 
        Mexico, and the largest airspace controlled by the Department of 
        Defense, comprising 9,600 square miles above ground, where the range 
        conducts unparalleled military testing;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range is increasingly partnering with Holloman Air 
        Force Base and Fort Bliss to ensure that the unique assets of the region 
        are used to the utmost extent to contribute to national security, 
        including support of testing and training that is realistic, large-
        scale, and joint or combined;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range is a home site of the Network Integration 
        Evaluation, which is a series of semiannual evaluations led by members 
        of the Armed Forces that are designed to further integrate and rapidly 
        progress the tactical network of the Army;
Whereas the most recent iteration of the Network Integration Evaluation occurred 
        in October and November of 2014 and involved 3,900 members of the Armed 
        Forces, allowing the Army to stay on the cutting edge of technology and 
        providing an invaluable resource to national defense;
Whereas the Southern New Mexico-El Paso Joint Land Use Study demonstrates the 
        strong relationship that White Sands Missile Range shares with Holloman 
        Air Force Base and Fort Bliss in western Texas and indicates that the 
        range has an annual economic impact of $1,717,289 on the region;
Whereas White Sands Missile Range has the distinguished honor of hosting the 
        annual Bataan Memorial Death March, which commemorates members of the 
        Armed Forces, and forces from the Philippines, who fought and died 
        defending the Philippines only hours after the start of the Japanese 
        attack on Pearl Harbor, and who, after a valiant defense of the 
        Philippines, were captured by the Japanese and forced to march 65 miles 
        without any food, water, or medical care, while the Japanese 
        systematically abused them, leading to the deaths of many of them; and
Whereas the mission of White Sands Missile Range remains as pertinent to 
        national security in 2015 as it was in 1945, and the range should be 
        preserved and strengthened presently and for future generations: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 70th anniversary of White Sands 
        Missile Range in New Mexico;
            (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the commanders, 
        members of the Armed Forces, civilians, and other individuals 
        who have contributed to the mission and community of White 
        Sands Missile Range throughout its 70-year history;
            (3) recognizes the great impact that White Sands Missile 
        Range has made on national security in the United States, 
        particularly its contributions in missile defense and space 
        technology;
            (4) memorializes the sacrifice made by brave members of the 
        Armed Forces, and forces from the Philippines, who defended the 
        Philippines and endured the Bataan Death March; and
            (5) encourages the preservation and strengthening of White 
        Sands Missile Range presently and for future generations.
