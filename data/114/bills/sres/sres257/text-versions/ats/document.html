Congratulating Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver 
                on their graduation from Ranger School.

Whereas United States Army Rangers ``Lead the Way!'' and have played a decisive 
        role in military engagements since before the Revolutionary War;
Whereas Ranger School prepares members of the Armed Forces to serve as leaders 
        and members of elite combat forces tasked with dismounted infantry, 
        airborne, airmobile, amphibious, and independent squad and platoon-size 
        operations;
Whereas Ranger School is one of the toughest training courses for which a member 
        can volunteer, with three phases testing a member's ability to patrol, 
        navigate, mountaineer, and execute combat arms functional skills;
Whereas students in Ranger School train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of 
        their minds and bodies;
Whereas although many members apply to Ranger School, fewer than 45 percent, on 
        average, possess the mental and physical toughness required to earn the 
        highly coveted Ranger tab signifying graduation from the School;
Whereas Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver braved the 
        rigors of Ranger School, becoming the first women to successfully earn 
        the Ranger tab;
Whereas they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their fellow members, carrying 
        their own weight and, at times, the weight of others;
Whereas their personal courage, sacrifices, and extraordinary leadership skills 
        establish them as role models for women and men alike, proving that 
        skill, not gender, determines military aptitude and success; and
Whereas, as graduates of the United States Military Academy, they exemplify the 
        time-honored creed of ``Duty, Honor, Country'', and will continue to 
        shape the future of our military and the Rangers in the years to come: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors and recognizes the patriotism and historic 
        contributions to the United States by Captain Kristen Griest 
        and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver;
            (2) commends their character, courage, and tenacity as the 
        first women to earn the Ranger tab signifying graduation from 
        Ranger School;
            (3) recognizes that our military and our country are more 
        battle ready as a result of their accomplishments;
            (4) celebrates their service as they continue to ``Lead the 
        Way!'' as our Nation's newest United States Army Rangers; and
            (5) congratulates them for their inspiring and 
        groundbreaking accomplishments.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
