                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 14, 2016

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating September 2016 as ``National Child Awareness Month'' to 
 promote awareness of charities benefiting children and youth-serving 
organizations throughout the United States and recognizing the efforts 
  made by those charities and organizations on behalf of children and 
  youth as critical contributions to the future of the United States.

Whereas millions of children and youth in the United States represent the hopes 
        and future of the United States;
Whereas numerous individuals, charities benefiting children, and youth-serving 
        organizations that work with children and youth collaborate to provide 
        invaluable services to enrich and better the lives of children and youth 
        throughout the United States;
Whereas raising awareness of, and increasing support for, organizations that 
        provide access to health care, social services, education, the arts, 
        sports, and other services will result in the development of character 
        and the future success of the children and youth of the United States;
Whereas the month of September, as the school year begins, is a time--

    (1) when parents, families, teachers, school administrators, and 
communities increase focus on children and youth throughout the United 
States; and

    (2) for the people of the United States to highlight and be mindful of 
the needs of children and youth;

Whereas private corporations and businesses have joined with hundreds of 
        national and local charitable organizations throughout the United States 
        in support of a month-long focus on children and youth; and
Whereas designating September 2016 as ``National Child Awareness Month'' would 
        recognize that a long-term commitment to children and youth is in the 
        public interest and will encourage widespread support for charities and 
        organizations that seek to provide a better future for the children and 
        youth of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2016 as ``National 
Child Awareness Month''--
            (1) to promote awareness of charities benefiting children 
        and youth-serving organizations throughout the United States; 
        and
            (2) to recognize the efforts made by the charities and 
        organizations on behalf of children and youth as critical 
        contributions to the future of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
