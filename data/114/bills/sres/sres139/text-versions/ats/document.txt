   Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the attack on the Alfred P. 
                        Murrah Federal Building.

Whereas on April 19, 1995, at 9:02 a.m. central daylight time, in Oklahoma City, 
        Oklahoma, the United States was attacked in 1 of the worst terrorist 
        attacks on United States soil, which killed 168 people and injured more 
        than 850 others;
Whereas this dishonorable act of domestic terrorism affected thousands of 
        families and horrified millions of people across the State of Oklahoma 
        and the United States;
Whereas the people of Oklahoma and the United States responded to this tragedy 
        through the remarkable efforts of local, State, and Federal law 
        enforcement, firefighters, and emergency services, search and rescue 
        teams from across the United States, public and private medical 
        personnel, and thousands of volunteers from the community who saved 
        lives, assisted the injured and wounded, comforted the bereaved, and 
        provided meals and support to those who came to Oklahoma City to help 
        the those endangered and affected by that terrorist act;
Whereas the people of Oklahoma and the United States pledged themselves to build 
        and maintain a permanent national memorial to remember those who were 
        killed, those who survived, and those changed forever;
Whereas that pledge was fulfilled by creating the Oklahoma City National 
        Memorial, which draws hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the 
        world every year to the site of that tragic event in United States 
        history;
Whereas the Oklahoma City National Memorial brings comfort, strength, peace, 
        hope, and serenity to the many visitors who come to the memorial and the 
        museum of the memorial each year to remember and to learn; and
Whereas the 20th anniversary of the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
        Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is on April 19, 2015: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) joins with the people of the United States in sending 
        best wishes and prayers to the families, friends, and neighbors 
        of the 168 people killed in the terrorist bombing of the Alfred 
        P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma;
            (2) sends the best wishes and thoughts of Congress to those 
        injured in the bombing;
            (3) expresses the gratitude of Congress for the recovery of 
        those injured;
            (4) thanks the thousands of first responders, rescue 
        workers, medical personnel, and volunteers from the Oklahoma 
        City community and across the United States who answered the 
        call for help that April morning and in the days and weeks that 
        followed;
            (5) resolves to work with the people of the United States 
        to promote the goals and mission established by the Oklahoma 
        City National Memorial on the 20th anniversary of that fateful 
        day;
            (6) supports the resolve for the future, written on the 
        wall of the memorial, ``We come here to remember those who were 
        killed, those who survived, and those changed forever. May all 
        who leave here know the impact of violence. May this memorial 
        offer comfort, strength, peace, hope, and serenity.'';
            (7) congratulates the people of Oklahoma City for making 
        tremendous progress over the past 2 decades and demonstrating 
        their steadfast commitment to the ability of hope to triumph 
        over violence;
            (8) applauds the people of Oklahoma City as they continue 
        to persevere and to stand as a beacon to the rest of the United 
        States and the world attesting to the strength of goodness in 
        overcoming evil wherever it arises in our midst; and
            (9) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an 
        enrolled copy of this resolution to the Memorial Foundation, as 
        an expression of appreciation.
