                               RESOLUTION


 
      Expressing the sense of the Senate on the conflict in Yemen.

Whereas the enduring security partnership between the United States Government 
        and the Government of Saudi Arabia has historically served to preserve 
        the stability of the Middle East;
Whereas the United States Armed Forces provide support to the armed forces of 
        Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners to support their military 
        operations in Yemen, including over 700 air-to-air refueling sorties, 
        and to assist with effectiveness and reduction of collateral damage;
Whereas the United States Government has consistently urged all sides of the 
        conflict in Yemen to take all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of 
        harm to civilians and to comply with their obligations under 
        international humanitarian law, which includes minimizing harm to 
        civilians and differentiating between civilian infrastructure and 
        military objectives; and
Whereas designated foreign terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda in the 
        Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which 
        pose a grave threat to the national security of the United States, have 
        significantly expanded the territory under their control in Yemen since 
        the Government of Saudi Arabia began military operations in Yemen on 
        March 26, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) all sides to the current conflict in Yemen should--
                    (A) abide by international obligations to protect 
                civilians;
                    (B) facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief 
                throughout the country; and
                    (C) respect negotiated cease-fires and work toward 
                a lasting political settlement;
            (2) United States-supported Saudi military operations in 
        Yemen should--
                    (A) take all feasible precautions to reduce the 
                risk of harm to civilians and civilian objects, in 
                compliance with international humanitarian law; and
                    (B) increase prioritization of targeting of 
                designated foreign terrorist organizations, including 
                al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and affiliates of the 
                Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant;
            (3) the Houthi-Saleh forces engaged in the conflict in 
        Yemen should--
                    (A) cease indiscriminate shelling of areas 
                inhabited by civilians; and
                    (B) allow free access by humanitarian relief 
                organizations seeking to deliver aid to civilian 
                populations under siege; and
            (4) a reconstruction and stabilization plan should be 
        developed alongside a negotiated political framework, in 
        consultation with local stakeholders and with robust financing 
        from the international community, including Gulf Cooperation 
        Council countries that have previously made pledges to fund 
        Yemen's post-conflict reconstruction.
