                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the people of Burma on their commitment to peaceful 
                               elections.

Whereas Burma conducted general elections on November 8, 2015, the country's 
        first national vote since a civilian government was introduced in 2011 
        that ended nearly 50 years of military rule;
Whereas the people of Burma have, by their vigorous participation in electoral 
        campaigning and public debate, strengthened the foundations of a free 
        and democratic way of life;
Whereas preliminary reports indicate that voter turnout exceeded 80 percent;
Whereas international observers have reported that election day was largely free 
        and fair and conducted in an orderly and peaceful fashion despite 
        broader structural concerns such as the disenfranchisement of the 
        Rohingya;
Whereas the ruling military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party suffered a 
        dramatic loss at the polls, and the National League for Democracy won a 
        sizable majority in both chambers of Burma's Union Parliament, the 
        Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, and will select Burma's next President;
Whereas Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has symbolized the struggle 
        for freedom and democracy in Burma and has actively supported democratic 
        reform through her leadership of the National League for Democracy;
Whereas the National League for Democracy espouses a policy of nonviolent 
        movement towards multi-party democracy in Burma, supports national 
        reconciliation, and endorses strengthening democratic institutions, 
        protecting human rights, implementing free market economic reforms, and 
        reinforcing rule of law;
Whereas President Thein Sein and Commander-in-Chief Min Aug Hlaing made public 
        commitments to respect the election results and vowed to abide by the 
        law to ensure an orderly and prompt transition to a new government; and
Whereas the continued democratic development of Burma is a matter of fundamental 
        importance to the advancement of United States interests in Southeast 
        Asia and is supported by the United States Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the people of Burma for embracing 
        democracy through their participation in the November 8, 2015, 
        general elections and for their continuing efforts in 
        developing a free, democratic society that respects 
        internationally recognized human rights;
            (2) recognizes the National League for Democracy's victory 
        as a reflection of the will of the Burmese people;
            (3) calls on the Union Solidarity Development Party to 
        undertake a peaceful transfer of power and abide by the law to 
        ensure an orderly and prompt transition to a new government;
            (4) encourages all parties to pursue national 
        reconciliation talks and work together in the spirit of 
        national unity to seek what is best for the country;
            (5) recognizes that while the Government of Burma has made 
        important progress towards democratization, there remain 
        important impediments to the realization of full democratic and 
        civilian government, including the reservation of unelected 
        seats for the military and the disenfranchisement of groups of 
        people including the Rohingya;
            (6) expresses hope that newly elected members of parliament 
        and a prompt and orderly transition to a new government will 
        herald a new generation of responsible leadership in Burma;
            (7) calls on the Government of Burma to support meaningful 
        efforts to reform the 2008 Constitution of Burma, with the full 
        and unfettered participation of the people of Burma and in a 
        manner that promotes and protects democratic development of 
        Burma and safeguards against arbitrary interference by the 
        military;
            (8) supports negotiations between the Government of Burma 
        and ethnic-based peoples and organizations;
            (9) encourages the President of the United States to take 
        further steps toward normalization of relations with Burma and 
        consider the potential relaxation of restrictions should the 
        Union Solidarity Development Party respect the election results 
        and proceed with a prompt and orderly transition in power; and
            (10) reaffirms that the people of the United States will 
        continue to stand with the people of Burma in support of 
        democracy, partnership, and peace.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
