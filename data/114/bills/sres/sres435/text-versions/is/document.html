Whereas, on Kids to Parks Day, individuals from rural and urban areas of the 
        United States can be reintroduced to the splendid national, State, and

Whereas communities across the United States offer a variety of natural 
        resources and public land, often with free access, to individuals 
        seeking outdoor recreation;
Whereas the people of the United States, young and old, should be encouraged to 
        lead more healthy and active lifestyles;
Whereas Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for families to take a break from 
        their busy lives and come together for a day of active, wholesome fun; 
        and
Whereas Kids to Parks Day will broaden an appreciation for nature and the 
        outdoors in young people, foster a safe setting for independent play and 
        healthy adventure in neighborhood parks, and facilitate self-reliance 
        while strengthening communities: Now, therefore, be it
