                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing a commitment by the Senate to never forget the service of 
                      aviation's first responders.

Whereas the events of September 11, 2001, forever changed the United States as 
        the people of the United States faced unspeakable destruction and grief 
        that touched millions of lives;
Whereas 4 commercial aircraft were turned into weapons of mass destruction, 
        killing nearly 3,000 innocent people at the World Trade Center, the 
        Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania;
Whereas the crewmembers of United Flight 175, American Flight 11, American 
        Flight 77, and United Flight 93 acted as first responders, providing the 
        first information about the unfolding attacks and selflessly protecting 
        the United States and the lives of countless others;
Whereas ever since 9/11, pilots and flight attendants in the United States 
        report to work with heightened responsibilities as first responders and 
        as the last line of defense in aviation security; and
Whereas the bravery of the crewmembers 15 years ago and our crewmember heroes 
        are prominent in the hearts and minds of the people of the United 
        States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) forever memorializes the service of aviation's first 
        responders on that fateful day; and
            (2) will always seek to honor the sacrifice of aviation's 
        first responders, who continue to keep the United States safe 
        today.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
