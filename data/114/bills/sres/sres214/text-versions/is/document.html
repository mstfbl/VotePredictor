  Commemorating the 85th anniversary of the Daughters of Penelope, a 
     preeminent international women's association and an affiliate

                              Association.

Whereas the Daughters of Penelope is a leading international organization of 
        women of Hellenic descent and of Philhellenes, that was founded on 
        November 16, 1929, in San Francisco, California, to improve the status 
        and well-being of women and their families and to provide women the 
        opportunity to make significant contributions to their communities and 
        country;
Whereas the mission of the Daughters of Penelope is to promote philanthropy, 
        education, civic responsibility, good citizenship, family and individual 
        excellence, and the ideals of ancient Greece, through community service 
        and volunteerism;
Whereas Daughters of Penelope chapters sponsor affordable and dignified housing 
        to the senior citizen population of the United States by participating 
        in the supportive housing for the elderly program established under 
        section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q);
Whereas Penelope House, a domestic violence shelter for women and their children 
        sponsored by the Daughters of Penelope in Mobile, Alabama, is the first 
        of its kind in the State of Alabama and is recognized as a model shelter 
        for others to emulate throughout the United States;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope also sponsors Penelope's Place, a domestic 
        violence shelter in Brockton, Massachusetts;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope Foundation, Inc., supports the educational 
        objectives of the Daughters of Penelope by providing tens of thousands 
        of dollars annually for scholarships, sponsoring educational seminars, 
        and donating children's books to libraries, schools, shelters, and 
        churches through the Penelope's Books program;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope is the first ethnic organization to submit to 
        the Library of Congress oral history tapes, which provide an oral 
        history of first generation Greek American women in the United States;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope promotes awareness of and provides financial 
        support to charitable organizations, including the University of Miami 
        Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (formerly the Papanicolaou Cancer 
        Center), the Alzheimer's Foundation, and the American Heart Association;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope also promotes awareness of and provides 
        financial support to medical research for breast cancer and other 
        cancers, Thalassemia (also known as Cooley's Anemia), 
        Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and Muscular Dystrophy;
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope provides support and financial assistance to 
        victims and communities affected by natural disasters such as 
        hurricanes, earthquakes, and forest fires; and
Whereas the Daughters of Penelope has supported and contributed to organizations 
        such as the Special Olympics, the Barbara Bush Foundation for Literacy, 
        the Children's Wish Foundation, UNICEF, Habitat for Humanity, St. Basil 
        Academy, and countless other organizations that help families and 
        communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the significant contributions of American 
        citizens of Greek ancestry and of Philhellenes to the United 
        States; and
            (2) commemorates the 85th anniversary of the Daughters of 
        Penelope in 2015, applauds its mission, and commends the many 
        charitable contributions of its members to organizations and 
        communities worldwide.
