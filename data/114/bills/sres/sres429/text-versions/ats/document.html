                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 14, 2016

    Mr. Perdue (for himself and Mr. Carper) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of April 11 through 
       April 15, 2016, as ``National Assistant Principals Week''.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP), the 
        National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), and the 
        American Federation of School Administrators (AFSA) have designated the 
        week of April 11 through April 15, 2016, as ``National Assistant 
        Principals Week'';
Whereas an assistant principal, as a member of the school administration, 
        interacts with many sectors of the school community, including support 
        staff, instructional staff, students, and parents;
Whereas assistant principals are responsible for establishing a positive 
        learning environment and building strong relationships between school 
        and community;
Whereas assistant principals play a pivotal role in the instructional leadership 
        of their schools by supervising student instruction, mentoring teachers, 
        recognizing the achievements of staff, encouraging collaboration among 
        staff, ensuring the implementation of best practices, monitoring student 
        achievement and progress, facilitating and modeling data-driven 
        decision-making to inform instruction, and guiding the direction of 
        targeted intervention and school improvement;
Whereas the day-to-day logistical operations of schools require assistant 
        principals to monitor and address facility needs, attendance, 
        transportation issues, and scheduling challenges, as well as supervise 
        extra- and co-curricular events;
Whereas assistant principals are entrusted with maintaining an inviting, safe, 
        and orderly school environment that supports the growth and achievement 
        of each and every student by nurturing positive peer relationships, 
        recognizing student achievement, mediating conflicts, analyzing behavior 
        patterns, providing interventions, and, when necessary, taking 
        disciplinary actions;
Whereas since its establishment in 2004, the NASSP National Assistant Principal 
        of the Year Program recognizes outstanding middle and high school 
        assistant principals who demonstrate success in leadership, curriculum, 
        and personalization; and
Whereas the week of April 11 through April 15, 2016, is an appropriate week to 
        designate as National Assistant Principals Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of April 11 through April 15, 
        2016, as ``National Assistant Principals Week'';
            (2) honors the contributions of assistant principals to the 
        success of students in the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Assistant Principals Week with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities that promote awareness of the role played by 
        assistant principals in school leadership and ensuring that 
        every child has access to a high-quality education.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
