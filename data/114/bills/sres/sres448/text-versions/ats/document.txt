 Recognizing the roles and contributions of the teachers of the United 
  States in building and enhancing the civic, cultural, and economic 
                    well-being of the United States.

Whereas education and knowledge form the foundation of the current and future 
        strength of the United States;
Whereas teachers and other education staff have earned and deserve the respect 
        of their students and communities for the selfless dedication of the 
        teachers and staff to community service and the futures of the children 
        of the United States;
Whereas the purposes of National Teacher Appreciation Week, held from May 2, 
        2016, through May 6, 2016, are to raise public awareness of the 
        unquantifiable contributions of teachers and to promote greater respect 
        and understanding for the teaching profession; and
Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations 
        representing educators are hosting teacher appreciation events in 
        recognition of National Teacher Appreciation Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) thanks the teachers of the United States; and
            (2) promotes the profession of teaching by encouraging 
        students, parents, school administrators, and public officials 
        to participate in teacher appreciation events during National 
        Teacher Appreciation Week.
                                 <all>
