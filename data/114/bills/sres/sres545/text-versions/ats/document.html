                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 14, 2016

 Ms. Stabenow submitted the following resolution; which was considered 
                             and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the designation of July 15, 2016, as ``Leiomyosarcoma 
                            Awareness Day''.

Whereas a soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer, accounting for 
        approximately 1 percent of newly diagnosed cancers;
Whereas Leiomyosarcoma (referred to in this preamble as ``LMS'') is a malignant 
        subtype of soft tissue sarcoma that originates in smooth muscle, often 
        in the walls of blood vessels;
Whereas LMS is highly aggressive and can be found throughout the body, but is 
        especially concentrated in the uterus, abdominal cavity, and 
        extremities;
Whereas the National Institutes of Health classifies LMS as a rare disease;
Whereas most oncologists will only see a few cases of LMS throughout a career;
Whereas the causes of LMS are still unknown;
Whereas LMS is largely resistant to standard chemotherapeutic agents, radiation 
        treatment, and current immunotherapies;
Whereas multidisciplinary care coordination teams, because of their expertise 
        and experience, are critical to the health of LMS patients;
Whereas LMS research will allow medical professionals to improve the quality of 
        care for LMS patients, lead to better clinical outcomes, and promote 
        longer survival for LMS patients; and
Whereas increased education and awareness about LMS will contribute to the well-
        being of the communities of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of July 15, 2016, as 
        ``Leiomyosarcoma Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes the challenges faced by Leiomyosarcoma 
        patients; and
            (3) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, 
        researchers, and caregivers across the country working to 
        improve the quality of life of Leiomyosarcoma patients and the 
        families of Leiomyosarcoma patients.
