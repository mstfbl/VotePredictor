                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency 
               Response program on its 30th anniversary.

Whereas the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response program 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``TRANSCAER'') is a voluntary national 
        outreach effort that focuses on assisting communities to prepare for and 
        respond to a possible hazardous material transportation incident;
Whereas TRANSCAER was founded in 1986;
Whereas TRANSCAER members consist of--

    (1) volunteer representatives from the chemical manufacturing, 
transportation, distribution, and emergency response industries;

    (2) volunteer representatives from industry associations;

    (3) volunteer personnel of those industries and industry associations; 
and

    (4) government representatives;

Whereas TRANSCAER offers hundreds of training events each year;
Whereas TRANSCAER offered training to tens of thousands of responders between 
        1986 and 2016;
Whereas TRANSCAER is a unified industry initiative that promotes the safe 
        transportation and handling of hazardous materials;
Whereas TRANSCAER aids community emergency response planning for hazardous 
        material transportation incidents;
Whereas TRANSCAER builds strong relationships and trust with communities located 
        along transportation routes, and those relationships and trust could 
        help to ensure that an incident is handled safely, appropriately, and 
        efficiently; and
Whereas TRANSCAER demonstrates the continuing commitment of chemical 
        manufacturers and transporters to the safe transportation of hazardous 
        materials: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the Transportation Community 
Awareness and Emergency Response program (commonly referred to as 
``TRANSCAER'') on its 30th anniversary.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
