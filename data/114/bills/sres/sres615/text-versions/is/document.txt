                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           November 16, 2016

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of November 16, 2016, as 
                    ``American Special Hockey Day''.

Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 15 
        percent of children in the United States have a developmental 
        disability;
Whereas the United States needs innovative, high-quality programs that seek to 
        create productive and independent futures for children and adults with 
        developmental disabilities;
Whereas the American Special Hockey Association was created in 2000 to give 
        individuals of all ages with developmental disabilities an opportunity 
        to learn and grow by playing ice hockey;
Whereas team sports provide opportunities for children to develop independence, 
        confidence, and fitness and the programs of the American Special Hockey 
        Association provide the chance for individuals with disabilities to play 
        sports in an accessible environment so that all athletes are able to 
        participate;
Whereas the American Special Hockey Association is the largest special hockey 
        organization in the world with more than 54 member programs in more than 
        45 cities in the United States;
Whereas special hockey exists to enrich athletes with developmental disabilities 
        and, in addition to physical hockey skills, the program helps children 
        develop critical skills such as dependability, self-reliance, 
        concentration, willingness to share, and personal accountability; and
Whereas ``American Special Hockey Day'' will help recognize the important role 
        that special hockey plays in empowering individuals with disabilities 
        and developing the characteristics that will help players to be more 
        successful both on and off the ice: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of November 16, 2016, as 
        ``American Special Hockey Day'';
            (2) strongly affirms the goals and purpose of special 
        hockey; and
            (3) encourages more individuals to volunteer and help 
        create similarly innovative and beneficial programs for 
        individuals with disabilities.
                                 <all>
