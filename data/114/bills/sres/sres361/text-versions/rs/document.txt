                               RESOLUTION


 
        Urging robust funding for humanitarian relief for Syria.

Whereas the conflict in Syria, which is in its fifth year, has taken the lives 
        of over 250,000 Syrians and displaced millions more;
Whereas the humanitarian needs for Syria are overwhelming and require a 
        sustained, tangible response from the entire international community to 
        ensure that the short- and long-term needs of the Syrian people are 
        addressed;
Whereas, as the short- and long-term needs of the Syrian people increase, the 
        availability of basic services for the almost 4,600,000 Syrians 
        sheltering in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, and other neighboring countries, 
        which are already under severe strain, is diminishing;
Whereas addressing the humanitarian situation in Syria and in Syrian refugee-
        hosting countries is an essential component to providing stability to 
        the region;
Whereas the Government of Kuwait, notably, hosted pledging conferences in 2013, 
        2014, and 2015 to raise funds for United Nations humanitarian appeals 
        for Syria;
Whereas the pledges to previous United Nations humanitarian appeals for Syria 
        have failed to meet the humanitarian needs of the Syrian crisis, as 
        determined by the United Nations;
Whereas not all pledges are fully converted into donations, further adding to 
        the difficulty in meeting the humanitarian needs of Syria;
Whereas, on February 4, 2016, the Governments of the United Kingdom, Germany, 
        Kuwait, and Norway will host hosted a fourth Syria conference in London 
        to raise funds and support for the United Nations humanitarian appeal 
        for Syria;
Whereas the fourth Syria conference aims aimed to significantly increase 
        funding--

    (1) to address the immediate and long-term needs of individuals 
affected by the Syrian conflict; and

    (2) to maintain pressure on parties to the conflict to protect 
civilians affected by the conflict;

Whereas, as of February 2016, the United States is the largest single 
        humanitarian donor to the Syrian crisis and has given over 
        $4,500,000,000 in humanitarian relief for Syria; and
Whereas the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, and Norway are allies of the United 
        States and have demonstrated commitment to addressing the humanitarian 
        crisis in Syria: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the Governments of the United Kingdom, Kuwait, 
        Germany, and Norway for their efforts to address the 
        humanitarian crisis in Syria, including the substantial 
        financial commitments made by the Governments of the United 
        Kingdom, Kuwait, Germany, and Norway;
            (2) encourages the international community to act with 
        urgency--
                    (A) to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Syria 
                and in Syrian refugee-hosting countries in the region; 
                and
                    (B) to support the upcoming efforts undertaken as a 
                result of the fourth Syria conference in London by 
                joining the United States and other countries with 
                substantial pledges of assistance; and
            (3) urges each donor country to fulfill the United Nations 
        pledging commitments to Syria to address the short- and long-
        term humanitarian needs of the Syrian people.
