                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the first week of April 2016 as ``National Asbestos 
                           Awareness Week''.

Whereas dangerous asbestos fibers are invisible and cannot be smelled or tasted;
Whereas the inhalation of airborne asbestos fibers can cause significant damage;
Whereas asbestos fibers can cause cancer, such as mesothelioma and asbestosis, 
        and other health problems;
Whereas symptoms of asbestos-related diseases can take between 10 and 50 years 
        to present themselves;
Whereas the projected life expectancy for an individual diagnosed with 
        mesothelioma is between 6 and 24 months;
Whereas generally, little is known about late-stage treatment of asbestos-
        related diseases and there is no cure for asbestos-related diseases;
Whereas early detection of asbestos-related diseases may give some patients 
        increased treatment options and might improve the prognoses of those 
        patients;
Whereas the United States has substantially reduced the consumption of asbestos 
        in the United States, yet the United States continues to consume about 
        400 metric tons of the fibrous mineral each year for use in certain 
        products throughout the United States;
Whereas asbestos-related diseases have killed thousands of people in the United 
        States;
Whereas while exposure to asbestos continues, safety and prevention of asbestos 
        exposure--

    (1) has significantly reduced the incidence of asbestos-related 
diseases; and

    (2) can further reduce the incidence of asbestos-related diseases;

Whereas thousands of workers in the United States face significant asbestos 
        exposure, which has been a cause of occupational cancer;
Whereas thousands of people in the United States die from asbestos-related 
        diseases every year;
Whereas a significant percentage of all asbestos-related disease victims were 
        exposed to asbestos on naval ships and in shipyards;
Whereas before 1975, asbestos was used in the construction of a significant 
        number of office buildings and public facilities, including schools;
Whereas people in the small community of Libby, Montana, suffer from asbestos-
        related diseases, including mesothelioma, at a significantly higher rate 
        than people in the United States as a whole; and
Whereas the designation of a ``National Asbestos Awareness Week'' will raise 
        public awareness about the prevalence of asbestos-related diseases and 
        the dangers of asbestos exposure: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the first week of April 2016 as ``National 
        Asbestos Awareness Week'';
            (2) urges the Surgeon General of the United States to warn 
        and educate people about the public health issue of asbestos 
        exposure, which may be hazardous to their health; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Office of the Surgeon 
        General.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
