                               RESOLUTION


 
    Commemorating October 22, 2015, as the 50th anniversary of the 
          enactment of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965.

Whereas, on October 22, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Highway 
        Beautification Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-285; 79 Stat. 1028), also 
        known as ``Lady Bird's Bill'', ``to protect the public investment in 
        [public] highways, to promote the safety and recreational value of 
        public travel, and to preserve natural beauty'';
Whereas, earlier in 1965, President Johnson convened a White House Conference on 
        Natural Beauty that recommended, among other things, certain highway 
        beautification actions;
Whereas, at the signing of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (Public Law 
        89-285; 79 Stat. 1028), President Johnson stated: ``This bill does not 
        represent everything that we wanted. It does not represent what we need. 
        It does not represent what the national interest requires. But it is a 
        first step, and there will be other steps. For though we must crawl 
        before we walk, we are going to walk.'';
Whereas, since inception, the National Highway System has expanded to, as of 
        October 2015, over 220,000 miles stretching across the United States; 
        and
Whereas the national vision led by President Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson for a 
        more beautiful highway system should be remembered and renewed: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the legacy and vision of President Lyndon B. 
        Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson on the 50th anniversary of the 
        enactment of the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (Public Law 
        89-285; 79 Stat. 1028);
            (2) commends the organizations, volunteers, and businesses 
        that work to support the vision of a more beautiful United 
        States;
            (3) recognizes that beautiful highways and scenic byways--
                    (A) promote--
                            (i) economic development; and
                            (ii) national and international tourism; 
                        and
                    (B) reflect the best of the United States; and
            (4) renews the previous commitment of the Senate to--
                    (A) protect the public investment in public 
                highways;
                    (B) promote the safety and recreational value of 
                public travel; and
                    (C) preserve the natural beauty of the United 
                States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
