Whereas, since the 1960s, the Perelman School of Medicine has been home to many 
        major medical innovations, including--

    (1) the identification of the ``Philadelphia Chromosome'', which 
demonstrated the genetic basis of cancer;

    (2) the development of cognitive psychotherapy;

    (3) pioneering work in transplant surgery;

    (4) the development of intravenous nutrition;

        or Medicine and numerous Lasker Award winners;

        post-doctoral students and more than 5,200 faculty and staff;

        departments, as well as 24 interdisciplinary centers and institutes; and

        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 250th anniversary of the Perelman School 
        of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania;
            (2) commends the faculty, staff, and students at the 
        Perelman School of Medicine for their continued hard work and 
        devotion to advancing science and medicine; and
            (3) congratulates the Perelman School of Medicine for its 
        distinguished history and long record of supporting medical
