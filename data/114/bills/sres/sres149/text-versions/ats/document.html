                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the importance and inspiration of the Hubble Space 
                               Telescope.

Whereas the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope on April 24, 1990, from the 
        Kennedy Space Center marked a historic moment in space discovery and 
        observation;
Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration designed, built, and 
        placed the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit;
Whereas the Space Shuttle Discovery transported the Hubble Space Telescope on 
        the STS-31 mission and placed the Telescope into orbit at 380 statute 
        miles;
Whereas the crew on the Space Shuttle Discovery consisted of Commander Loren J. 
        Shriver, Pilot Charles F. Bolden, Jr., Mission Specialist Bruce 
        McCandless II, Mission Specialist Kathryn D. Sullivan, and Mission 
        Specialist Steven A. Hawley;
Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope weighed more than 24,000 pounds at launch, 
        currently weighs 27,000 pounds following the final servicing mission in 
        2009, and measures more than 43 feet in length;
Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope orbits the Earth at 17,000 miles per hour and 
        has completed more than 3,000,000,000 miles of orbit around the Earth;
Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope continues to provide more than 10 Terabytes 
        of data annually and has been heralded as one of the most productive 
        scientific instruments known to man;
Whereas the spirit of discovery, innovation, and exploration is enshrined in the 
        productivity of the Hubble Space Telescope; and
Whereas the Hubble Space Telescope has made significant advancements and 
        discoveries in planetary sciences, cosmology, and galactic sciences: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration on the 25th anniversary of the Hubble Space 
        Telescope launch;
            (2) recognizes the scientists, crew, engineers, and staff 
        who contributed to the success of the Hubble Space Telescope;
            (3) notes the significance of the discoveries and 
        contributions to science of the Hubble Space Telescope as well 
        as the subsequent innovations that were derived from the data 
        collected from the Hubble Space Telescope; and
            (4) acknowledges that the Hubble Space Telescope has 
        captured images from and answered questions about space and has 
        inspired generations of young people to go into the fields of 
        science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and research.
