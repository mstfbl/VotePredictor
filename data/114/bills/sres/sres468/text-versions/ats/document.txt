                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week of May 15 through May 21, 2016, as ``National 
                             Police Week''.

Whereas, in 1962, John Fitzgerald Kennedy signed the Joint Resolution entitled 
        ``Joint Resolution to authorize the President to proclaim May 15 of each 
        year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week of each year 
        during which such May 15 occurs as Police Week'' (36 U.S.C. 136);
Whereas Federal, State, local, and tribal police officers, sheriffs, and other 
        law enforcement officers across the United States serve with valor, 
        dignity and integrity;
Whereas law enforcement officers are charged with pursuing justice for all 
        individuals and performing their duties with fidelity to the 
        constitutional and civil rights of the individuals that the law 
        enforcement officers serve;
Whereas, in 2016, the Senate solemnly commemorates the 25th anniversary of the 
        National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, a national monument that 
        pays homage to the more than 20,000 law enforcement heroes who made the 
        ultimate sacrifice for the safety and protection of the United States 
        and its people;
Whereas, in 2016, on the 15th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist 
        attacks against the United States, the Senate honors the memory of those 
        who perished, including the 72 law enforcement officers who were lost on 
        that fateful day, and recognizes the tireless efforts of the law 
        enforcement community to protect the citizenry and homeland through 
        diligent investigations that disrupt terrorist plots, stem the flow of 
        financing to terrorist networks, and bring evildoers to justice;
Whereas law enforcement officers selflessly serve their neighborhoods, often at 
        the risk of their own personal safety, and remain resolute in responding 
        to calls for help despite their badges, at times, serving as a target 
        for senseless acts of violence;
Whereas the vigilance, compassion, and decency of law enforcement officers are 
        the best defense of society against individuals who prowl communities 
        seeking to do harm;
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 2016, honors 123 law enforcement officers 
        recently killed in the line of duty, including Joseph James Abdella, 
        Gregory Thomas Alia, Darrell Lamond Allen, Adrian Arellano, James 
        Matthew Bava, Gregg Anthony Benner, James Arthur Bennett, Jr., Sean 
        Michael Bolton, Louis Michael Bonacasa, Robert James Bowling, Michael

Whereas 35 law enforcement officers across the United States have made the 
        ultimate sacrifice during the first 4 months of 2016: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of May 15 through May 21, 2016, as 
        ``National Police Week'';
            (2) expresses strong support for law enforcement officers 
        across the United States for their efforts to build safer and 
        more secure communities;
            (3) recognizes the need to ensure that law enforcement 
        officers have the equipment, training, and resources necessary 
        to protect their health and safety while the law enforcement 
        officers are protecting the public;
            (4) recognizes the members of the law enforcement community 
        for their selfless acts of bravery;
            (5) acknowledges that police officers and other law 
        enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
        should be remembered and honored; and
            (6) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
        that promote awareness of the vital role of law enforcement 
        officers in building safer and more secure communities across 
        the United States.
