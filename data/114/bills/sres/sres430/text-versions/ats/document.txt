                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 14, 2016

   Mr. Gardner (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of April 20, 2016, as ``Cheyenne Mountain 
                                 Day''.

Whereas, since 1966, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (in this preamble 
        referred to as ``Cheyenne Mountain'') in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has 
        been a synergistic hub for tracking security threats worldwide, serving 
        as an essential component to the defense of North America and to global 
        security;
Whereas countless space and ground sensor data collections are synthesized at 
        Cheyenne Mountain, providing vital information for the key threat 
        assessments needed to ensure the safety and security of millions of 
        people throughout North America;
Whereas the 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, 
        Colorado, provides operational support and infrastructure 
        sustainability;
Whereas the 721st Mission Support Group at Cheyenne Mountain provides dedicated 
        daily sustainment to more than 13 mission partners performing the 
        national security mission inside of the Cheyenne Mountain Complex;
Whereas, every day, more than 1,000 military and civilian personnel of the 
        United States and Canada, residing in Colorado and working at Cheyenne 
        Mountain, are ever vigilant in ensuring the collective common defense of 
        North America;
Whereas Cheyenne Mountain is--

    (1) a valuable national security asset;

    (2) seen as one of the greatest engineering marvels of its time; and

    (3) relevant both now and in the future;

Whereas Colorado is proud to be a nexus of capabilities that provide for the 
        defense of North America, which is critical to global security not only 
        today but also in the future; and
Whereas April 20, 2016, is the 50th anniversary of Cheyenne Mountain achieving 
        full operational capability and would be an appropriate date to 
        designate as ``Cheyenne Mountain Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of April 20, 2016, as 
        ``Cheyenne Mountain Day'';
            (2) recognizes the strategic importance of Cheyenne 
        Mountain Air Force Station to the defense of North America; and
            (3) commends the efforts of the 21st Space Wing, the 721st 
        Mission Support Group, and the 1,000 military and civilian 
        personnel of the United States and Canada working at the 
        Cheyenne Mountain Complex to support the collective common 
        defense of North America.
