                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the terrorist attacks in Brussels and honoring the memory of 
  the United States citizens murdered in those attacks, and offering 
    thoughts and prayers for all the victims, condolences to their 
  families, resolve to support the Belgian people, and the pledge to 
 defend democracy and stand in solidarity with the country of Belgium 
   and all our allies in the face of continuing terrorist attacks on 
                          freedom and liberty.

Whereas, on March 22, 2016, three suicide bombers and their accomplices 
        conducted three coordinated terrorist attacks across the city of 
        Brussels, Belgium, killing at least 32 civilians and wounding over 340 
        innocent men, women, and children;
Whereas these terrorist attacks were conducted in order to maximize casualties, 
        the 7:58 a.m. explosions targeted the Brussels-Zaventem Airport morning 
        rush and the 9:10 a.m. metro attack targeted those commuting to and from 
        the Maelbeek metro station, which is near the United States Embassy and 
        the European Union headquarters buildings;
Whereas evidence suggests that these attacks explicitly targeted United States 
        interests by placing explosive devices in front of the American 
        Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines check-in counters;
Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has claimed responsibility 
        for these attacks, which marks the second time in just over four months 
        that ISIS has used suicide bombers to attack innocent civilians in a 
        Western European capital;
Whereas the world still grieves for those innocent lives lost and injured in 
        Paris, the 129 murdered civilians and the 350 injured men, women, and 
        children;
Whereas Charles Michel, the Prime Minister of Belgium, has responded to these 
        horrors by calling for solidarity: ``[W]hat we feared has happened. Our 
        country and citizens have been hit by a terrorist attack, in a violent 
        and cowardly way . . . To those who have chosen to be the barbaric 
        enemies of liberty, of democracy, of fundamental values, I want to say 
        with the greatest strength that we will remain assembled and united.'';
Whereas President Barack Obama has called these attacks ``yet another reminder 
        that the world must unite; we must be together, regardless of 
        nationality or race or faith, in fighting against the scourge of 
        terrorism'';
Whereas Justin and Stephanie Shults, an American married couple, were murdered 
        at the airport, where they had just taken Stephanie's mother for her 
        flight back to the United States after visiting the Shults' home in 
        Belgium;
Whereas Justin and Stephanie Shults met at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, 
        Tennessee, close to both where Justin grew up in Gatlinburg, Tennessee 
        and Stephanie grew up in Lexington, Kentucky;
Whereas Justin and Stephanie lived in Brussels and worked for CLARCOR and Mars, 
        respectively, both United States corporations;
Whereas Alexander and Sascha Pinczowski, Dutch siblings who called New York 
        home, were murdered at the airport while speaking on the phone with 
        their mother;
Whereas Mayor Bill de Blasio called Alexander and Sascha ``two of our own'';
Whereas Gail Minglana Martinez, wife of United States' Air Force Lieutenant 
        Colonel Kato Martinez, was injured in the airport attack with her 
        husband of 21 years and their four children;
Whereas that blast ultimately claimed the life of Gail Minglana Martinez, a 
        native of Corpus Christi, Texas;
Whereas the Governments of Belgium, France, and Germany have expanded 
        counterterrorism operations, resulting in the arrest of over twelve 
        suspected terrorists across their countries between March 24 and 25, 
        2016; and
Whereas these attacks represent a continued assault on freedom and democracy and 
        an unmitigated evil that plagues the Middle East and the wider world, 
        against which the United States and our allies must stand united in 
        fighting: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the terrorist attacks on March 22, 2016, in 
        Brussels, Belgium that killed 32 people and injured hundreds;
            (2) honors the memories of Justin and Stephanie Shults, 
        Alexander and Sascha Pinczowski, and Gail Martinez, who were 
        murdered by the Islamic State in these heinous terrorist 
        attacks;
            (3) expresses its heartfelt condolences and deepest 
        sympathies for the victims of these attacks and their families;
            (4) renews the solidarity of the Government and people of 
        the United States with the people and the leadership of 
        Belgium, as well as those throughout the world who work to 
        eliminate terrorism;
            (5) pledges United States support to Belgium, Europe, and 
        all United States allies in the effort to defeat ISIS and 
        associated groups; and
            (6) reaffirms its commitment to the transatlantic 
        relationship and the shared values of freedom, democracy, and 
        human rights.
