                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the month of October 2015 as ``National Women's Small 
                           Business Month''.

Whereas the Small Business Administration has declared the month of October 2015 
        to be ``National Women's Small Business Month'' along with the 
        celebration of the anniversary of the signing of the Women's Business 
        Ownership Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-533; 102 Stat. 2689) that 
        established the National Women's Business Council and the Women's 
        Business Center program;
Whereas there are over 9,900,000 women-owned small businesses in the United 
        States;
Whereas women-owned small businesses collected $1,600,000,000,000 in total 
        receipts in 2012, which is an increase of 35 percent since 2007;
Whereas the rate of growth for women-owned employer firms is 3 times that of 
        men-owned employer firms;
Whereas, since 2007, the number of women-owned small businesses in the United 
        States has increased by 2,100,000 and women-owned small businesses have 
        added nearly 1,500,000 more jobs;
Whereas Congress continues to support the National Women's Business Council and 
        the focus of the National Women's Business Council on alleviating 
        obstacles faced by women small business owners and women entrepreneurs; 
        and
Whereas the celebration of ``National Women's Small Business Month'' would honor 
        women small business owners and women entrepreneurs and recognize the 
        significance of their contributions to the small business community: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the month of October 2015 as ``National 
        Women's Small Business Month'';
            (2) honors the vital role of women small business owners 
        and women entrepreneurs in the United States during ``National 
        Women's Small Business Month'';
            (3) recognizes the significant contributions of women small 
        business owners and women entrepreneurs to the small business 
        community;
            (4) supports and encourages young women entrepreneurs to 
        pursue their passions and create more start-up businesses;
            (5) recognizes the importance of creating policies that 
        promote a business-friendly environment for small business 
        owners that is free of unnecessary regulations and red tape; 
        and
            (6) supports efforts to increase awareness of the value of 
        women-owned small businesses on the economy of the United 
        States.
