                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week.

Whereas multiple sclerosis (referred to in this preamble as ``MS'') can impact 
        individuals of all ages, races, and ethnicities but is at least 2 to 3 
        times more common in women than in men;
Whereas there are approximately 2,300,000 individuals worldwide who have been 
        diagnosed with MS;
Whereas MS is typically diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 50, 
        but it is estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and 
        adolescents are living with MS in the United States;
Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that interrupts the flow of 
        information both within the brain and between the brain and the rest of 
        the body;
Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in the extremities to 
        blindness and paralysis, and the progress, severity, and specific 
        symptoms of MS in any 1 person cannot yet be predicted;
Whereas there is no laboratory test available that can definitively diagnose MS;
Whereas, while MS is not directly inherited, studies show that there are genetic 
        and, most likely, environmental factors that make certain individuals, 
        such as Caucasians of Northern European ancestry, more susceptible to 
        the disease than others;
Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown and there is no cure;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national network of independent MS 
        organizations dedicated to the enhancement of the quality of life for 
        all those affected by MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis 
        Awareness Week;
Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is to increase 
        opportunities for cooperation among MS organizations and to provide 
        greater opportunity for the effective use and development of resources 
        for the benefit of individuals and families affected by MS;
Whereas the United States plays a critical role in coordinating MS research 
        globally and amplifies the impact of research in the United States 
        through which results are delivered to MS patients;
Whereas, in 2012, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society was a founding member 
        of the Progressive MS Alliance, which coordinates research to accelerate 
        the development of treatments for progressive MS by removing 
        international scientific and technological barriers and which now 
        includes MS societies from 15 countries;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and supports Multiple 
        Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of every calendar year;
Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are to invite people to 
        join the movement to end MS, encourage everyone to do something to 
        demonstrate a commitment to moving toward a world free of MS, and 
        acknowledge those who have dedicated time and talent to help promote MS 
        research and programs; and
Whereas, in 2016, Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is recognized during the 
        week of March 7 through March 11: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
        Awareness Week;
            (2) encourages States, localities, and the territories and 
        possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
        ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing 
        proclamations designating Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (3) encourages media organizations to--
                    (A) participate in Multiple Sclerosis Awareness 
                Week; and
                    (B) help provide education to the public about 
                multiple sclerosis;
            (4) commends the efforts of States, localities, and the 
        territories and possessions of the United States to support the 
        goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
        States to ending multiple sclerosis by--
                    (A) promoting awareness about individuals that are 
                affected by multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) supporting multiple sclerosis research and 
                education programs;
            (6) recognizes all individuals in the United States living 
        with multiple sclerosis;
            (7) expresses gratitude to the family members and friends 
        of individuals living with multiple sclerosis, who are a source 
        of love and encouragement to those individuals; and
            (8) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
        researchers who--
                    (A) provide assistance to individuals affected by 
                multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) continue to work to find ways to stop the 
                progression of the disease, restore nerve function, and 
                end multiple sclerosis forever.
                                 <all>
