                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing Connecticut's Submarine Century, the 100th anniversary of 
the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New London, and Connecticut's 
  historic role in supporting the undersea capabilities of the United 
                                States.

Whereas, on March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval appropriations Act that 
        authorized the Secretary of the Navy to ``receive and accept a deed of 
        gift, when offered by the State of Connecticut, of a tract of land with 
        not less than one mile of shore front on the Thames River near New 
        London, Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval 
        purposes'';
Whereas the people of Connecticut and the towns and cities in the southeastern 
        region of Connecticut subsequently gifted land to establish a military 
        installation to fulfil the Nation's need for a naval facility on the 
        Atlantic coast;
Whereas, on April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of gift of land from 
        Connecticut to establish a naval yard and storage depot along the 
        eastern shore of the Thames River in Groton, Connecticut;
Whereas, between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard supported a diverse 
        range of missions, including berthing inactive Civil War era ironclad 
        warships and serving as a coaling station for refueling naval ships 
        traveling in New England waters;
Whereas Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New London Navy Yard in 
        1912, following an impassioned effort by Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, 
        who stated that this ``action proposed is not only unjust but 
        unreasonable and unsound as a military proposition'';
Whereas the outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of submarines to sink 
        allied military and civilian ships in the Atlantic sparked a new focus 
        on developing submarine capabilities in the United States;
Whereas October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New London Navy Yard of the 
        submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under the care of the tender USS OZARK, 
        soon followed by the arrival of submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the 
        care of the tender USS TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of 
        the first ship built as a submarine tender, the USS FULTON (AS-1);
Whereas, on June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling assumed the command of the 
        newly designated Naval Submarine Base New London, the New London 
        Submarine Flotilla, and the Submarine School;
Whereas in the 100 years since the arrival of the first submarines to the base, 
        Naval Submarine Base New London has grown to occupy more than 680 acres 
        along the east side of the Thames River, with more than 160 major 
        facilities, 15 nuclear submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and 
        activities, including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval Submarine 
        School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, the Naval 
        Undersea Medical Institute, and the newly established Undersea 
        Warfighting Development Center;
Whereas in addition to being the site of the first submarine base in the United 
        States, Connecticut was home to the foremost submarine manufacturers of 
        the time, the Lake Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport and the Electric 
        Boat Company in Groton, which later became General Dynamics Electric 
        Boat;
Whereas General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented workforce, and its 
        Connecticut-based and nationwide network of suppliers have delivered 
        more than 200 submarines from its current location in Groton, 
        Connecticut, including the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS 
        NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built 
        by the United States;
Whereas the Submarine Force Library and Museum, located adjacent to Naval 
        Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, is the only submarine 
        museum operated by the United States Navy and today serves as the 
        primary repository for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to 
        the bold and courageous history of the Submarine Force and highlights as 
        its core exhibit the Historic Ship NAUTILUS (SSN 571) following her 
        retirement from service;
Whereas reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and the Navy that began 
        with the gift of land that established the base, the State of 
        Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 in funding for critical 
        infrastructure investments to support the mission of the base, including 
        construction of a new dive locker building, expansion of the Submarine 
        Learning Center, and modernization of energy infrastructure;
Whereas, on September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy designated 
        October 2015 through October 2016 as Connecticut's Submarine Century, a 
        year-long observance that celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in 
        Connecticut, including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine 
        Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial anniversary of the 
        establishment of Naval Submarine Base New London and the Naval Submarine 
        School;
Whereas Naval Submarine Base New London still proudly proclaims its motto of 
        ``The First and Finest''; and
Whereas Congressman Higgins' statement before Congress in 1912 that 
        ``Connecticut stands ready, as she always has, to bear her part of the 
        burdens of the national defense'' remains true today: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution 
        to the Navy and submarine force by the people of Connecticut, 
        both through the initial deed of gift that established what 
        would become Naval Submarine Base New London and through their 
        ongoing commitment to support the mission of the base and the 
        Navy personnel assigned to it;
            (2) honors the submariners who have trained and served at 
        Naval Submarine Base New London throughout its history in 
        support of the Nation's security and undersea superiority;
            (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and 
        workforce of Connecticut in designing, building, and sustaining 
        the Navy's submarine fleet; and
            (4) encourages the recognition of Connecticut's Submarine 
        Century by Congress, the Navy, and the American people by 
        honoring the contribution of the people of Connecticut to the 
        defense of the United States and the important role of the 
        submarine force in safeguarding the security of the United 
        States for more than a century.
