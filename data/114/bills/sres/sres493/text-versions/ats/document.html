  Relative to the death of George V. Voinovich, former United States

Whereas George Voinovich was born in Cleveland, Ohio, attended Ohio University 
        and Ohio State University College of Law;
Whereas George Voinovich began his career faithfully serving the State and the 
        people of Ohio as an assistant attorney general of Ohio in 1963; served 
        as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1967 to 1971; 
        served as Cuyahoga County auditor from 1971 to 1976; served as a member 
        of the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners from 1977 to 1978; was 
        elected lieutenant governor in 1978; and served as mayor of Cleveland 
        from 1979 to 1989;
Whereas, George Voinovich was elected governor of Ohio in 1991 and was elected 
        to a second term by a landslide, securing 72% of the vote, the highest 
        percentage of the vote ever won by gubernatorial candidate in Ohio 
        history;
Whereas, during his time as governor, he was known for his advocacy and practice 
        of fiscal responsibility, embodied in his call to ``working harder and 
        smarter, doing more with less'';
Whereas, under his tenure as Governor, Ohio's unemployment rate fell to a 25-
        year low and he restored the state's budget to financial health;
Whereas, in 1998, George Voinovich was elected to the United States Senate and 
        served until 2011, during which time he was Chairman of the Select 
        Committee on Ethics and a member of the Appropriations Committee;
Whereas, in 2004, George Voinovich was re-elected to the United States Senate 
        with more votes than any other Senate candidate in Ohio history;
Whereas, for every public office he held, George Voinovich improved government 
        operations, accountability and financial management; he worked to 
        improve the environment, with particular attention to Lake Erie, and 
        making America more secure;
Whereas, throughout his life, George Voinovich was guided by his deep faith, 
        personal integrity, fiscal responsibility, respect and service to his 
        fellow citizens, and above all, his abiding love of his family, state 
        and nation;
Whereas the people of Ohio have demonstrated their appreciation and affection 
        for Senator Voinovich by the naming of numerous landmarks after him, 
        including Voinovich Centennial Park, the Voinovich Innerbelt Bridge, and 
        The George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio 
        University;
Whereas, in his two terms in the United States Senate and in his other public 
        service, George Voinovich reached across the aisle and sought common 
        ground to solve problems: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep 
regret the announcement of the death of George Voinovich, former member 
of the United States Senate.
    Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate these 
resolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled 
copy thereof to the family of the deceased.
    Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned 
as a further mark of respect to the memory of the late George V. 
Voinovich.
