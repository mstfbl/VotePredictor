   Honoring Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, as Rutgers 
                   celebrates its 250th anniversary.

Whereas, on November 10, 1766, the Royal Governor of New Jersey, William 
        Franklin, granted a charter in the name of King George III for the 
        establishment of Queen's College;
Whereas in 1825, Queen's College was renamed Rutgers in honor of Colonel Henry 
        Rutgers, a university trustee and Revolutionary War veteran;
Whereas in 1864, Rutgers was designated as a land-grant college, offering 
        educational access to a wide range of students who would become the new 
        workforce for expanding businesses, factories, and farms of the United 
        States;
Whereas in 1869, Rutgers became the birthplace of college football by hosting a 
        game against Princeton University and winning 6 to 4;
Whereas in 1946, the University of Newark became part of Rutgers, laying the 
        foundation for Rutgers University-Newark;
Whereas in 1950, the College of South Jersey became part of Rutgers, giving rise 
        to Rutgers University-Camden;
Whereas in 1945 and 1956, the New Jersey State legislature designated Rutgers as 
        the State University of New Jersey;
Whereas in 1989, Rutgers became a member of the Association of American 
        Universities, an association of the top research universities in the 
        United States and Canada;
Whereas with the integration of most of the University of Medicine and Dentistry 
        of New Jersey into Rutgers School of Biomedical and Health Sciences in 
        2013, Rutgers undertook the largest merger in the history of higher 
        education in the United States;
Whereas in 2014, Rutgers joined the Big Ten Conference, bringing the long 
        history of collegiate athletics at Rutgers into the storied conference 
        comprised of highly regarded, research-intensive flagship universities;
Whereas in 2014, Rutgers joined the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, the 
        premier consortium of top-tier research institutions in the United 
        States;
Whereas, as of November 2015, Rutgers--

    (1) educates more than 65,000 students at 31 schools;

    (2) employs more than 22,000 faculty and staff;

    (3) records more than 1,700,000 patient visits annually; and

    (4) boasts more than 460,000 living alumni worldwide;

Whereas the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Rutgers is November 10, 
        2016;
Whereas the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Rutgers 
        begins on November 10, 2015, with Charter Day festivities on the lawn of 
        Old Queens and will continue through November 10, 2016; and
Whereas Rutgers exemplifies all of the traditions of higher education in the 
        United States because Rutgers is the only university in the United 
        States that is--

    (1) a colonial college;

    (2) a land-grant college; and

    (3) a comprehensive public research university: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate honors Rutgers, the State University of 
New Jersey, as Rutgers celebrates 250 years of rich history as a 
colonial college, a land-grant institution, and a great State 
university that has been a source of pride for New Jersey and the 
people of the United States since 1766.
