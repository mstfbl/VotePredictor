                               RESOLUTION


 
          Recognizing June 20, 2016, as ``World Refugee Day''.

Whereas World Refugee Day is a global day to acknowledge the courage, strength, 
        and determination of women, men, and children who are forced to flee 
        their homes due to conflict, violence, and persecution;
Whereas according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (referred 
        to in this preamble as ``UNHCR'')--

    (1) there are more than 65,300,000 displaced people worldwide, the 
highest levels ever recorded, including almost 21,300,000 refugees, 
40,800,000 internally displaced people, and 3,200,000 people seeking 
asylum;

    (2) children account for 51 percent of the refugee population in the 
world, millions of whom are unable to access basic services including 
education;

    (3) nearly 4,800,000 refugees have fled Syria since the start of the 
Syrian conflict and more than 6,600,000 people are internally displaced 
within Syria;

    (4) since January 2014, more than 3,300,000 Iraqis fleeing violence 
have been internally displaced, and 277,000 refugees have fled to 
neighboring countries;

    (5) ongoing conflict, violence, and persecution have resulted in the 
displacement of millions across South Sudan, Ukraine, Colombia, and the 
Central African Republic;

    (6) since April 2015, sporadic outbursts of violence in Burundi have 
prompted more than 265,000 Burundians to flee to the neighboring countries 
of Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo;

    (7) violent insurgent attacks in Nigeria have forced 220,000 people to 
flee to the neighboring countries of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger, and have 
internally displaced nearly 2,200,000 people;

    (8) between January and June of 2016, more than 206,000 refugees and 
migrants have crossed the Mediterranean Sea attempting to reach Europe and 
at least 2,800 women, men, and children have died during such crossings or 
are missing after such attempts; and

    (9) approximately 95,000 women, men, and children, including many 
persecuted Rohingya refugees from Burma, have departed on the boats of 
smugglers in the Bay of Bengal since 2014, more than 1,100 of whom have 
died at sea;

Whereas refugees who are women and girls are often at a greater risk of sexual 
        violence and exploitation, forced or early marriage, human trafficking, 
        and other forms of gender-based violence;
Whereas the United States is the largest donor to UNHCR and provides critical 
        resources and support to international and nongovernmental organizations 
        working with refugees around the world; and
Whereas since 1975, the United States has welcomed more than 3,000,000 refugees 
        who are resettled in communities across the country: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to 
        promote the safety, health, and well-being of the millions of 
        refugees, including the education of refugee children and 
        displaced persons who flee war, persecution, or torture in 
        search of peace, hope, and freedom;
            (2) calls upon the United States Government--
                    (A) to continue its international leadership role 
                in response to those who have been displaced, including 
                the most vulnerable populations who may endure sexual 
                violence, human trafficking, forced conscription, 
                persecution, or exploitation;
                    (B) to find solutions to existing conflicts and 
                prevent new conflicts from beginning;
                    (C) to provide humanitarian and development support 
                to countries around the world that are hosting millions 
                of refugees to alleviate social and economic strains 
                placed on host communities; and
                    (D) to encourage the international community to 
                increase resources to address current and projected 
                refugee crises;
            (3) commends those who have risked their lives working 
        individually and for nongovernmental organizations and 
        international agencies such as UNHCR who have provided life-
        saving assistance and helped protect those displaced by 
        conflict around the world; and
            (4) reiterates the strong commitment of the United States 
        to protect and assist millions of refugees and other forcibly 
        uprooted persons worldwide, consistent with the values of the 
        United States and with the interests of national security.
