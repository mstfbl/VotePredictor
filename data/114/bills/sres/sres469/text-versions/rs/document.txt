   Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a 
       seminal moment in the journey of Ireland to independence.

Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising has a particular 
        resonance in the United States;
Whereas since the founding of the United States, Irish people and the millions 
        of United States citizens of Irish descent have helped to shape the 
        history of the United States;
Whereas, in the words of President John F. Kennedy, ``No people ever believed 
        more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United 
        States.'';
Whereas 5 of the 7 signatories of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence spent 
        periods of time in the United States that significantly influenced the 
        thinking and actions of those signatories;
Whereas the United States is the only foreign country specifically mentioned in 
        the 1916 Proclamation of Independence;
Whereas the contemporary ties between the United States and Ireland are of 
        extraordinary depth and breadth;
Whereas continued United States engagement in the Northern Ireland peace process 
        is vital to safeguarding the gains made since the Good Friday Agreement;
Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising offers an opportunity 
        for remembrance, reconciliation, and reimagining of the future;
Whereas, on May 17 and 18, 2016, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of Ireland, 
        will visit Washington, DC, for events commemorating the 100th 
        anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising; and
Whereas more than 200 other commemorative events will take place across the 
        United States to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recalls the special ties between Ireland and the United 
        States, continually sustained and strengthened throughout the 
        intertwined history of both countries;
            (2) welcomes the program of commemorations in the United 
        States marking the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising 
        of Ireland, including the events taking place in Washington, 
        DC; and
            (3) recognizes the importance of nurturing and renewing the 
        unique relationship between the United States and Ireland, and 
        the people of the United States and Ireland, into the future.
