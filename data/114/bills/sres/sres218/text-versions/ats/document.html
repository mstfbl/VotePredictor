Congratulating the United States Women's National Team for winning the 
                          2015 FIFA World Cup.

Whereas on July 5, 2015, in Vancouver, Canada, the United States Women's 
        National Team won the FIFA Women's World Cup;
Whereas during the FIFA World Cup the United States Women's National Team 
        finished first in its group before eliminating teams representing the 
        Republic of Colombia, the People's Republic of China, and the Federal 
        Republic of Germany in the knockout stages to reach the final;
Whereas the United States secured a resounding 5 to 2 victory over Japan in the 
        highest scoring Women's World Cup Final in history, which included the 
        fastest hat trick in World Cup history by Carli Lloyd by the 16th minute 
        of the game;
Whereas the run of the United States Women's National Team in the 2015 World Cup 
        included a record-tying 540 consecutive minutes without conceding a 
        goal;
Whereas the United States Women's National Team became the first team to win the 
        FIFA Women's World Cup 3 times;
Whereas all 23 players on the roster should be congratulated, including captains 
        Christie Rampone and Abby Wambach, Golden Ball winner Carli Lloyd, 
        Golden Glove winner Hope Solo, as well as Shannon Boxx, Morgan Brian, 
        Lori Chalupny, Whitney Engen, Ashlyn Harris, Tobin Heath, Lauren 
        Holiday, Julie Johnston, Meghan Klingenberg, Ali Krieger, Sydney Leroux, 
        Alex Morgan, Alyssa Naeher, Kelley O'Hara, Heather O'Reilly, Christen 
        Press, Megan Rapinoe, Amy Rodriguez, and Becky Sauerbrunn;
Whereas head coach Jill Ellis displayed extraordinary leadership, adjusting the 
        team's starting lineup as the FIFA Women's World Cup progressed in order 
        to promote teamwork and capitalize on the talents of each player; and
Whereas dedicated fans, including a group of supporters known as the American 
        Outlaws, and citizens across the United States showed their unmitigated 
        support for the United States Women's National Team as the team competed 
        in Canada, and can now celebrate because the United States women are 
        world champions again: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the United States Women's National Team 
        for winning the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup through teamwork 
        and determination;

        coaches, and staff who contributed to the FIFA World Cup 
        winning team; and
            (3) celebrates the contributions of the millions of fans 
        across the Nation who cheered the United States Women's 
        National Team to victory, and made the players the best 
        supported team in the world.
