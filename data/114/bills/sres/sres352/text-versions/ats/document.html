                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the 30th anniversary of the loss of the Space Shuttle 
Challenger and of Teacher in Space S. Christa McAuliffe of Concord, New 
                               Hampshire.

Whereas, on January 28, 1986, the 7 crew members of the Space Shuttle 
        Challenger, Commander Francis R. Scobee, Pilot Michael J. Smith, Mission 
        Specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, Mission Specialist Ronald E. McNair, 
        Mission Specialist Judith A. Resnik, Payload Specialist Gregory B. 
        Jarvis, and Teacher in Space and Payload Specialist S. Christa 
        McAuliffe, were killed in a tragic explosion shortly after liftoff;
Whereas, for as long as there has been human consciousness, human beings have 
        looked to the stars in curiosity, delight, and awe;
Whereas, throughout the course of human history, humankind was Earth-bound, yet 
        spoke of visiting the celestial bodies;
Whereas the foundation and development of the United States were driven by a 
        pioneering spirit;
Whereas reaching out into space exhibits the strength of the human capacity to 
        engineer and persevere;
Whereas the people of the United States who have journeyed into space have 
        personified the national pride of the United States;
Whereas, in 1986, a crew of individuals representing the best of the United 
        States stepped forward to ride a rocket into space, knowing that 
        explorers throughout the ages have put the need for knowledge above 
        their own welfare;
Whereas, on January 28, 1986, the United States cried out in grief at the loss 
        of those 7 most brave voyagers;
Whereas Christa McAuliffe, a teacher with an infectious spirit and tremendous 
        bravery, not content to make the world her classroom, prepared to expand 
        her schoolroom to the stars;
Whereas Christa McAuliffe, through her educational endeavor, sought to inspire 
        adults and children alike by pushing the bounds of the human experience 
        and by rousing all people to imagine the most of human potential;
Whereas the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, New Hampshire is a 
        living memorial to embody the legacy of this intrepid woman; and
Whereas January 28, 2016, is a day on which the people of the United States 
        should pause to remember those pioneers who lost their lives 30 years 
        ago: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the loss of the 
        Space Shuttle Challenger;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to preserve 
        the legacy of the crew of the Challenger; and
            (3) recognizes the inspiration provided by a teacher for 
        all Earth, Christa McAuliffe.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
