                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Portland Cement Association, 
  the national organization for the cement manufacturing and concrete 
                               industry.

Whereas the first concrete road in the United States was built in 1890, and a 
        portion of the original pavement of that road is still in use as of May 
        2016;
Whereas, in 1916--

    (1) the Portland Cement Association was established as the national 
organization for the cement manufacturing and concrete industry; and

    (2) Congress passed the first Federal-aid highway legislation, setting 
in motion the development of a network of national highways;

Whereas, in 1921, the Portland Cement Association joined the Bureau of Public 
        Roads and various State agencies to determine the best ways to design 
        and build concrete roads, resulting in the Illinois Division of Highways 
        Bates Test Road, a landmark project that established the most economical 
        design for concrete pavements;
Whereas the Portland Cement Association participated in design and testing for 
        the Hoover Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam, and many other concrete projects;
Whereas 60 percent of the 41,000-mile highway system authorized under the 
        Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (70 Stat. 374), which established the 
        Highway Trust Fund, was constructed using concrete, based on research 
        and performance data identifying the significance of using concrete 
        throughout the interstate highway system;
Whereas due to new and increasing uses of concrete that required specialized 
        research, the Portland Cement Association added 2 new laboratory 
        facilities in 1958, a structural laboratory and a fire research center, 
        which resulted in the development of more durable and economical 
        buildings and improvements in fire safety for concrete structures and 
        transportation facilities;
Whereas 2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Portland 
        Cement Association; and
Whereas the Portland Cement Association advocates in support of sustainability, 
        resiliency, economic growth, infrastructure investment, and overall 
        innovation and excellence in construction throughout the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the Portland Cement 
        Association;
            (2) commends the Portland Cement Association for its work 
        and dedication to--
                    (A) the infrastructure of the United States; and
                    (B) innovative developments;
            (3) recognizes the strong initiatives of the Portland 
        Cement Association to improve the state of the cement industry; 
        and
            (4) recognizes the members of the Portland Cement 
        Association and all cement manufacturers on the centennial 
        celebration of the establishment of the Portland Cement 
        Association.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
