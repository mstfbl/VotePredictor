                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the ongoing sexual violence against women and children from 
Yezidi, Christian, Shabak, Turkmen, and other religious communities by 
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria militants and urging the prosecution of 
         the perpetrators and those complicit in these crimes.

Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has publicly and 
        systematically targeted communities on the basis of their religious 
        identities, including Yezidis, Christians, Shi'a Muslims, Shabaks, 
        Turkmens, and Kaka'i, in a campaign of violence that includes summary 
        executions, beheadings, torture, arbitrary detainment, forced 
        displacement, rape and sexual violence, and enslavement;
Whereas enslavement and sexual violence against women is a widespread practice 
        among ISIS militants, who have, according to the Yezidi Affairs 
        Directory, captured and enslaved as many as 5,500 Yezidis, including as 
        many as 3,000 women, since August 2014;
Whereas ISIS has established a formal slave trade in which women and girls as 
        young as 5 years old are systematically abducted, transported, 
        categorized according to physical traits and perceived value, and traded 
        among ISIS militants or sold for as little as $10;
Whereas the Research and Fatwa Department of ISIS has issued guidelines and 
        directions for the enslavement of Yezidi women and children and has 
        justified the actions on the basis of religious teachings;
Whereas the New York Times reported that ``the Islamic State has developed a 
        detailed bureaucracy of sex slavery, including sales contracts notarized 
        by the ISIS-run Islamic courts'';
Whereas, according to various reports, including testimony before Congress by 
        Khidher Domle, a Yezidi activist and Director of the Media Department at 
        the University of Dohuk, the enslavement and sexual violence used 
        against Yezidi women and children by ISIS militants in their attack on 
        Mount Sinjar was premeditated;
Whereas ISIS has initiated the mass killing of Yezidi men and boys, the sexual 
        violence and enslavement of Yezidi women and children, and the forced 
        displacement of Christians and other religious communities;
Whereas the threat and reach of ISIS extends beyond Iraq and Syria into the rest 
        of the world, as demonstrated by ISIS-affiliated attacks and recruitment 
        of foreign fighters from the United States, Europe, Central Asia, and 
        Africa;
Whereas, according to testimony presented before the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 29, 2015, it is 
        possible that one of the ISIS militants involved in the sexual slavery 
        of Yezidi women and children is a United States citizen; and
Whereas the United States Government should investigate and urge prosecution of 
        American citizens who are perpetrators of or complicit in such crimes: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the ongoing sexual violence against women and 
        children from Yezidi, Christian, Shabak, Turkmen, and other 
        religious communities;
            (2) calls on the Attorney General to commence the 
        investigation and prosecution of any United States citizens 
        alleged to be perpetrators of or complicit in these crimes and 
        to report back to Congress what steps are being taken to 
        investigate and urge the prosecution of those involved; and
            (3) calls on the Government of Iraq and the governments of 
        other countries to identify individual perpetrators and 
        individuals involved in these crimes and take appropriate 
        measures to arrest and urge the prosecution of those 
        individuals.
