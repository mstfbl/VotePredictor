                               RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize deposition testimony and representation in Care One 
Management LLC, et al. v. United Healthcare Workers East, SEIU 1199, et 
                                  al.

Whereas, in the case of Care One Management LLC, et al. v. United Healthcare 
        Workers East, SEIU 1199, et al., No. 2:12-cv-06371, pending in the 
        United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, testimony 
        has been sought from Rachel Pryor, a former employee in the office of 
        Senator Richard Blumenthal, relating to her official responsibilities;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent former employees of the Senate with 
        respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to 
        their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Rachel Pryor, former employee in the Office of 
Senator Richard Blumenthal, is authorized to testify in a deposition in 
the case of Care One Management LLC, et al. v. United Healthcare 
Workers East, SEIU 1199, et al., except concerning matters for which a 
privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Ms. 
Pryor in connection with the testimony authorized in section one of 
this resolution.
                                 <all>
