                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the American Tree Farm System.

Whereas forests, covering one-third of the land in the United States, provide 
        clean air and drinking water, abundant wildlife habitats, recreation 
        spaces, and renewable resources for buildings, furniture, energy, and 
        paper needs, and also serve as an economic driver supporting well-paying 
        jobs across the country;
Whereas most of the forests of the United States are owned by families and 
        individuals who reside in and steward rural regions;
Whereas, in 1941, the American Tree Farm System (in this preamble referred to as 
        the ``ATFS'') was founded to help family and individual woodland owners 
        sustain forests and the benefits that the forests provide;
Whereas the ATFS is composed of more than 79,000 individuals and families, who 
        together manage more than 20,500,000 acres of forest;
Whereas the ATFS remains a strong and essential program to conserve and manage 
        the forests of the United States and the benefits forests provide, 
        especially in the face of challenges like wildfires, invasive insects 
        and diseases, and growing development pressures;
Whereas tree farmers invest time, manpower, and personal funds to practice 
        sustainable forest management so that people across the United States 
        can enjoy the benefits forests provide;
Whereas the ATFS is made possible by volunteers from local small woodlands 
        associations, conservation organizations, State forestry agencies, 
        forest products companies, and the Cooperative Extension System;
Whereas, to support family forests, family woodland owners, and continued 
        voluntary conservation of working forests, it is important to expand the 
        reach of ATFS to additional woodland owners; and
Whereas 14 States in the United States have approved similar resolutions 
        recognizing the importance of the ATFS: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 75th anniversary of the American Tree 
        Farm System;
            (2) encourages the public to participate in activities that 
        celebrate the anniversary and highlight the importance of this 
        vital program, working family-owned forests, and the clean 
        water, wildlife habitats, and wood supply that forests provide 
        for all people in the United States; and
            (3) supports conservation and management of the trees and 
        forests of the United States through landowner participation 
        in--
                    (A) the conservation reserve program established 
                under subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle D of title 
                XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et 
                seq.);
                    (B) the environmental quality incentives program 
                established under chapter 4 of subtitle D of title XII 
                of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3839aa et 
                seq.);
                    (C) the conservation stewardship program 
                established under subchapter B of chapter 2 of subtitle 
                D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 
                U.S.C. 3838d et seq.);
                    (D) the agricultural conservation easement program 
                established under subtitle H of title XII of the Food 
                Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3865 et seq.); and
                    (E) the forest stewardship program established 
                under section 5 of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance 
                Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103a).
