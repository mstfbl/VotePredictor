                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 29, 2016

 Ms. Collins (for herself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating September 22, 2016, as ``National Falls Prevention 
  Awareness Day'' to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of 
                       falls among older adults.

Whereas individuals who are 65 years of age or older (in this preamble referred 
        to as ``older adults'') are the fastest growing segment of the 
        population in the United States and the number of older adults in the 
        United States will increase from 46,200,000 in 2014 to 82,300,000 in 
        2040;
Whereas more than 1 out of 4 older adults in the United States falls each year;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries among 
        older adults;
Whereas, in 2014, approximately 2,800,000 older adults were treated in hospital 
        emergency departments for fall-related injuries and more than 812,000 of 
        those older adults were subsequently hospitalized;
Whereas, in 2014, more than 27,000 older adults died from injuries related to 
        unintentional falls and the death rates from falls of older adults in 
        the United States have risen sharply in the last decade;
Whereas, in 2015, the total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for 
        older adults, adjusted for inflation, was $31,000,000,000;
Whereas, if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, the annual cost of fall 
        injuries will reach $67,700,000,000 by 2020; and
Whereas evidence-based programs reduce falls by utilizing cost-effective 
        strategies, such as exercise programs to improve balance and strength, 
        medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, 
        and fall prevention education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 22, 2016, as ``National Falls 
        Prevention Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls 
        prevention programs and policies;
            (3) commends the 72 member organizations of the Falls Free 
        Coalition and the falls prevention coalitions in 43 States and 
        the District of Columbia for their efforts to work together to 
        increase education and awareness about preventing falls among 
        older adults;
            (4) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
        local governments, the public health community, and health care 
        providers to work together to raise awareness of falls in an 
        effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults in 
        the United States;
            (5) recognizes the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention for its work developing and evaluating interventions 
        for all members of health care teams to make falls prevention a 
        routine part of clinical care;
            (6) recognizes the Administration for Community Living for 
        its work to promote access to evidence-based programs and 
        services in communities across the United States;
            (7) encourages State health departments and State units on 
        aging, which provide significant leadership in reducing 
        injuries and related health care costs by collaborating with 
        organizations and individuals, to reduce falls among older 
        adults; and
            (8) encourages experts in the field of falls prevention to 
        share their best practices so that their success can be 
        replicated by others.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
