                               RESOLUTION


 
  Reaffirming the United States-Argentina partnership and recognizing 
                     Argentina's economic reforms.

Whereas, on November 22, 2015, the citizens of the Argentine Republic elected 
        Mauricio Macri as their President;
Whereas President Macri has pledged to promote greater national unity, rebuild 
        the economy, combat domestic corruption, strengthen freedom of the 
        press, defend human rights abroad, attract foreign direct investment, 
        return to international credit markets, and reassert Argentina's 
        leadership globally;
Whereas President Macri has emphasized his intention to seek closer ties with 
        the United States and restore the bilateral partnership previously 
        enjoyed by both countries;
Whereas the Argentine Republic is a major non-NATO ally of the United States;
Whereas United States-Argentina relations are historically characterized by 
        comprehensive commercial ties and strong bilateral cooperation on human 
        rights, peacekeeping, science and technology, non-proliferation, and 
        education, as well as on regional and global issues;
Whereas President Barack Obama traveled to Argentina in March 2016 to strengthen 
        engagement on trade and investment, renewable energy, climate change, 
        security, and peacekeeping issues;
Whereas, in an appearance with President Macri at the Casa Rosada in Buenos 
        Aires, President Obama said that ``our countries share profound values 
        in common--respect for human rights, for individual freedoms, for 
        democracy, for justice, and for peace'';
Whereas the United States Department of the Treasury no longer opposes 
        multilateral development banks lending to Argentina because of the 
        Government of Argentina's ``progress on key issues and positive economic 
        policy trajectory'';
Whereas President Macri prioritized Argentina resolving its 15-year standoff 
        with private creditors stemming from the 2001-2002 economic crisis;
Whereas the Macri Administration lifted controls on trade, currency, and 
        poultry, enhanced the quality and transparency of government data, and 
        eliminated subsidies on electricity, water, and gas;
Whereas, in April 2016, the Government of Argentina issued $16,500,000,000 in 
        new government bonds and paid $9,300,000,000 to holdout creditors to 
        resolve its default settlements, which facilitated Argentina's return to 
        international financial markets;
Whereas Argentina is Latin America's third largest economy and the International 
        Monetary Fund, in April 2016, claimed the Macri Administration 
        ``embarked on an ambitious, much needed transition to remove domestic 
        imbalances and distortions and correct relative prices'';
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Argentina in August 2016 to launch 
        a High-Level Dialogue to develop and sustain cooperation on bilateral, 
        regional, and global challenges, including democratic development and 
        protection of human rights in Latin America; and
Whereas Secretary Kerry, during his visit, stated that ``the United States 
        strongly supports President Macri's effort to deepen Argentina's 
        integration with the global economy'' and that ``our governments will be 
        supporting policies that are aimed at strong, sustainable, and balanced 
        economic growth'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) upholds its commitment to the partnership between the 
        United States and Argentina and reaffirms that the Argentine 
        Republic is a major non-NATO ally of the United States;
            (2) encourages the Department of State to coordinate an 
        interagency strategy to increase cooperation with the 
        Government of Argentina on areas of bilateral, regional, and 
        global concern;
            (3) commends President Mauricio Macri and his 
        Administration for making far-reaching economic reforms that 
        will benefit the people of Argentina, stimulate economic 
        growth, and deepen Argentina's integration with the global 
        economy;
            (4) praises the Government of Argentina for resolving its 
        dispute with international creditors; and
            (5) encourages the Government of Argentina to continue to 
        investigate and prosecute those responsible for the 1994 
        bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in 
        Buenos Aires, as well as the January 2015 death of AMIA special 
        prosecutor Alberto Nisman.
