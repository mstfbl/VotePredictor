  Recognizing the 100th anniversary of Dinosaur National Monument and 
  designating October 4, 2015, as ``Dinosaur National Monument Day''.

Whereas in 1909, paleontologist Earl Douglass discovered the world-famous 
        Carnegie Quarry, a remarkable window to the dinosaurs of the late 
        Jurassic period;
Whereas on October 4, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson established Dinosaur 
        National Monument by Presidential Proclamation Number 1313 (39 Stat. 
        1752), which preserved the deposits of extraordinary dinosaur fossils;
Whereas on July 14, 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt enlarged Dinosaur 
        National Monument by Presidential Proclamation Number 2290 (53 Stat. 
        2454), to include the Green and Yampa River canyon country in order to 
        protect additional land of historical and scientific interest;
Whereas October 4, 2015, marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of 
        Dinosaur National Monument;
Whereas Dinosaur National Monument is a State and national treasure that 
        attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year and benefits 
        national, State, and local economies by generating millions of dollars 
        in revenue;
Whereas Dinosaur National Monument has the most complete geological record of 
        any unit of the National Park System;
Whereas Dinosaur National Monument protects more than 210,000 acres of 
        exceptionally diverse communities of plants and animals, including 
        bears, mountain lions, bighorn sheep, moose, elk, otters, and beavers;
Whereas Dinosaur National Monument contains the lower section of the Yampa 
        River, and the confluence of the Yampa and Green Rivers within Dinosaur 
        National Monument provides outstanding scientific opportunities to 
        observe and study the effects of the Rivers;
Whereas Dinosaur National Monument preserves and protects significant 
        archaeological evidence of the prehistoric Fremont Indians, providing an 
        excellent opportunity for research and education;
Whereas the National Park Service will continue the long tradition of preserving 
        and protecting Dinosaur National Monument for years to come, providing 
        access to the wilderness and wildlife within Dinosaur National Monument 
        for generations of Americans; and
Whereas on October 4, 2015, the National Park Service intends to celebrate the 
        start of the next century of stewardship for Dinosaur National Monument: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates and celebrates Dinosaur National Monument 
        on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the monument;
            (2) encourages all people of Colorado, Utah, and the United 
        States to visit that unique national treasure; and
