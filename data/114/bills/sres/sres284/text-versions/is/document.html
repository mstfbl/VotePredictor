                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the importance of mental health globally and highlighting 
the contributions and value of mental health, psychosocial support, and 
 human capacity, particularly in development contexts and humanitarian 
                               settings.

Whereas, on October 10, 2015, World Mental Health Day is observed;
Whereas mental health is essential to achieve the full potential of an 
        individual and mental health disorders can affect the ability of an 
        individual to carry out daily tasks, establish or maintain 
        relationships, or pursue other fundamental endeavors;
Whereas mental health disorders and substance use disorders are the leading 
        causes of disability globally;
Whereas depression is the third leading cause of disease burden globally, and by 
        2030, depression will be the highest cause of disease burden in low-
        income countries and the second highest cause of disease burden in 
        middle-income countries;
Whereas depression has a particularly negative impact on women, for whom 
        depression is the leading cause of disease burden independent of the 
        income level of their countries of residence;
Whereas approximately 3,000 suicide deaths occur each day globally;
Whereas for each completed suicide, 20 more individuals attempt to commit 
        suicide;
Whereas up to 90 percent of individuals who commit suicide have a diagnosable 
        mental health disorder;
Whereas serious and persistent mental illness, such as schizophrenia and bipolar 
        disorder, affects up to 7 percent of the population of the world and is 
        extremely debilitating;
Whereas the global cost of mental health disorders was $2,500,000,000,000 in 
        2010, and is projected to increase to more than $6,000,000,000,000 by 
        2030, but the total amount of development assistance for global mental 
        health was only $134,000,000 between 2007 and 2013, less than 1 percent 
        of all development assistance;
Whereas in high-income countries, approximately \1/2\ of individuals afflicted 
        with mental health disorders do not receive appropriate mental health 
        care;
Whereas in low-income countries, approximately 85 percent to 90 percent of 
        individuals afflicted with mental health disorders do not receive 
        appropriate mental health care;
Whereas traumatic events and losses are common experiences, especially among 
        refugees and internally displaced individuals, and may--

    (1) double the incidence of mental health disorders;

    (2) result in intense suffering and dysfunction; and

    (3) require mental health treatment;

Whereas integrating mental health and psychosocial support into health and 
        social sectors improves the health, economic development, and political 
        stability of the population, builds the capacity of staff and health 
        facilities, and creates nonstigmatizing mental health services; and
Whereas there is an urgent need to create readily accessible, high-quality 
        mental health services in line with national and global guidelines by 
        designing and implementing comprehensive programs that are culturally, 
        developmentally, and linguistically appropriate, building local human 
        resource capacity, and strengthening health systems: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the importance of World Mental Health Day;
            (2) affirms the continued support of the United States for 
        making resources available to provide mental health services 
        and build capacity across countries and income levels, in 
        particular in countries affected by conflict and crisis;
            (3) honors the importance of trained mental health workers 
        as they enhance human well-being and mental health, restore 
        functioning, and save lives by ensuring the availability of 
        high-quality, context-relevant mental health and psychosocial 
        support services;
            (4) calls on the Secretary of State, the Administrator of 
        the United States Agency for International Development, and the 
        heads of other relevant agencies to integrate mental health and 
        psychosocial support services into programs, funding 
        opportunities, and budget allocations in order to improve the 
        overall quality of life of individuals living with mental 
        health disorders; and
            (5) commends the dedication of organizations, 
        professionals, and volunteers globally who work to improve the 
        mental health of all individuals, and the important 
        contributions and bravery of individuals globally who live with 
        or have overcome mental health disorders.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
