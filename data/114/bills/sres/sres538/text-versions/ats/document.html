                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating September 2016 as ``National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas approximately 282,000 individuals in the United States live with a 
        spinal cord injury;
Whereas spinal cord injuries account for billions of dollars in health care 
        costs and lost wages in the United States;
Whereas approximately 40,000 spinal cord injury victims are veterans who 
        suffered a spinal cord injury while serving in the Armed Forces of the 
        United States;
Whereas motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of spinal cord injuries 
        and the third leading cause of traumatic brain injuries;
Whereas motor vehicle accidents account for approximately 50 percent of all 
        spinal cord injuries to children under the age of 18;
Whereas there is an urgent need to develop new neuroprotection, pharmacological, 
        and regeneration treatments to reduce and prevent future incidences of 
        paralysis and reverse current incidences of paralysis; and
Whereas increased education and investment in research are key factors in 
        improving outcomes for victims of spinal cord injuries, improving the 
        quality of life of victims of spinal cord injuries, and ultimately 
        curing paralysis: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2016 as ``National Spinal Cord 
        Injury Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Spinal Cord 
        Injury Awareness Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better 
        treatments, therapies, and a cure for spinal cord injuries;
            (4) supports clinical trials for promising new therapies 
        that offer hope to individuals living with paralysis; and
            (5) commends the dedication of national, regional, and 
        local organizations, researchers, doctors, volunteers, and 
        people of the United States that are working to improve the 
        quality of life of individuals living with a spinal cord injury 
        and the families of individuals living with a spinal cord 
        injury.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
