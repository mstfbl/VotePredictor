         To provide sufficient time for legislation to be read.

    Resolved, That (a) it shall not be in order for the Senate to 
consider any bill, resolution, message, conference report, amendment 
between the Houses, amendment, treaty, or any other measure or matter 
until 1 session day has passed since introduction for every 20 pages 
included in the measure or matter in the usual form plus 1 session day 
for any number of remaining pages less than 20 in the usual form.
    (b)(1) Any Senator may raise a point of order that consideration of 
any bill, resolution, message, conference report, amendment, treaty, or 
any other measure or matter is not in order under subsection (a). No 
motion to table the point of order shall be in order.
    (2) Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative 
vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. All motions 
to waive under this paragraph shall be debatable collectively for not 
to exceed 3 hours equally divided between the Senator raising the point 
of order and the Senator moving to waive the point of order or their 
designees. A motion to waive the point of order shall not be amendable.
    (3) This resolution is enacted pursuant to the power granted to 
each House of Congress to determine the Rules of its Proceedings in 
clause 2 of section 5 of article I of the Constitution of the United 
States.
