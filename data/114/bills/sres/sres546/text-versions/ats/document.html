                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 14, 2016

  Mr. Roberts (for himself and Ms. Stabenow) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Honoring the centennial of the United States Grain Standards Act.

Whereas before the enactment in 1916 of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 
        U.S.C. 71 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Act'') and the 
        United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 241 et seq.)--

    (1) the grading, weighing, and warehousing of grain was regulated 
exclusively by States;

    (2) there existed no uniform, nationwide system to inspect, weigh, and 
store grain; and

    (3) each State enacted laws, standards, and regulations relating to the 
inspection, weighing, and storage of grain;

Whereas, on August 11, 1916, the 64th Congress passed the Act, which established 
        national uniformity in grain standards;
Whereas, before 1916, foreign and domestic purchasers of grain were subject to 
        practices that could result in a poor quality of grain, despite 
        inspection certificates indicating higher grades, and farmers and others 
        involved in the United States grain trade suffered as a result;
Whereas, in 1916, Congress established an official inspection and certification 
        system that--

    (1) made available official inspection and certification;

    (2) prohibited conflicts of interest by personnel of the official 
inspection and certification system;

    (3) authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to use administrative 
sanctions to prevent corrupt practices; and

    (4) established prohibitions on certain acts and penalties for 
violations;

Whereas, in 1976, Congress amended the Act to require official inspection and 
        certification for grain exports and provide that any interested party 
        may request official inspection and certification for any United States 
        grain;
Whereas agricultural producers and purchasers benefitted from a system that 
        generated certainty and confidence in the uniformity of inspection 
        methods, weighing, and grading under rules and regulations protected by 
        law;
Whereas, on October 21, 1976, Congress amended the Act to establish the Federal 
        Grain Inspection Service to preserve the credibility and integrity of 
        the United States grain market;
Whereas 2016 is the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Federal Grain 
        Inspection Service to facilitate the marketing of United States grain 
        commodities;
Whereas for 100 years the Act has supported a system of marketing for United 
        States grain; and
Whereas, in 2016, the Act still provides certainty and transparency for United 
        States agriculture and consumers involved in the international grain 
        trade: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms the significance of the United States Grain 
        Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq.); and
            (2) finds that the United States Grain Standards Act (7 
        U.S.C. 71 et seq.) remains necessary to facilitate the movement 
        of United States grain into the marketplace by providing 
        agricultural producers, handlers, processors, exporters, and 
        international buyers an internationally recognized standard in 
        sampling, inspection, process verification, weighing, and 
        stowage examination services that accurately and consistently 
        describe the quality and quantity of grain commodities traded 
        domestically and internationally.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
