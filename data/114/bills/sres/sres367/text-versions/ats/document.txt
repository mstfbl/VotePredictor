                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education 
                                 Month.

Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers who are trained in skilled 
        professions;
Whereas, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, 80 percent of 
        respondents indicated a moderate to severe shortage of qualified skilled 
        production employees, including front-line workers such as machinists, 
        operators, craft workers, distributors, and technicians;
Whereas career and technical education (referred to in this preamble as ``CTE'') 
        ensures that competitive and skilled workers are ready, willing, and 
        capable of holding jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand career 
        fields such as science, technology, engineering, mathematics, nursing, 
        allied health, construction, information technology, energy 
        sustainability, and many other career fields that are vital in keeping 
        the United States competitive in the global economy;
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet the very real and immediate challenges 
        of economic development, student achievement, and global 
        competitiveness;
Whereas approximately 14,000,000 students are enrolled in CTE across the country 
        with CTE programs in nearly 1,300 public high schools and 1,700 2-year 
        colleges;
Whereas of the 20 fastest growing occupations--

    (1) 10 require an associate's degree or a degree with fewer 
requirements;

    (2) 13 with the largest numbers of new jobs projected require on-the-
job training, an associate's degree, or a certificate; and

    (3) nearly all require real-world skills that can be mastered through 
CTE;

Whereas CTE matches employability skills with workforce demand and provides 
        relevant academic and technical coursework leading to industry-
        recognized credentials for secondary, postsecondary, and adult learners;
Whereas CTE affords students the opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and 
        credentials needed to secure careers in growing, high-demand fields;
Whereas CTE students were significantly more likely than non-CTE student to 
        report having developed problem-solving, project completion, research, 
        math, college application, work-related, communication, time management, 
        and critical thinking skills during high school; and
Whereas students at schools with highly integrated rigorous academic and CTE 
        programs have significantly higher achievement in reading, mathematics, 
        and science than students at schools with less integrated programs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates February 2016 as ``Career and Technical 
        Education Month'' to celebrate career and technical education 
        across the United States;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical 
        Education month;
            (3) recognizes the importance of career and technical 
        education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce in 
        the United States; and
            (4) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to 
        promote career and technical education as an option to 
        students.
                                 <all>
