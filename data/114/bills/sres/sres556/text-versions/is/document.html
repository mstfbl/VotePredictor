 Mr. Cornyn (for himself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Peters, and

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of the week of September 12 
   through September 16, 2016, as ``National Family Service Learning 
                                Week''.

Whereas family service learning is a method under which children and families 
        learn and solve problems together in a multi-generational approach with 
        active participation in thoughtfully organized service that--

    (1) is conducted in and meets the needs of their communities;

    (2) is focused on children and families solving community issues 
together;

    (3) applies college and career readiness skills for children and 
relevant workforce training skills for adults; and

    (4) is coordinated between the community and an elementary school, 
secondary school, institution of higher education, or family community 
service program;

Whereas family service learning--

    (1) is multi-generational learning that involves parents, children, 
caregivers, and extended family members in shared learning experiences in 
physical and digital environments;

    (2) is integrated into and enhances the academic achievement of the 
children or the educational components of a family service program in which 
the families may be enrolled; and

    (3) encompasses skills, such as investigation, planning and 
preparation, action, reflection, demonstration of results, and 
sustainability;

Whereas family service learning has been shown to have positive 2-generational 
        effects and encourages families to invest in their communities to 
        improve economic and societal well-being;
Whereas, through family service learning, children and families are offered the 
        opportunity to solve community issues and learn together, thereby 
        enabling the development of life and career skills, such as flexibility 
        and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-
        cultural skills, productivity and accountability, and leadership and 
        responsibility;
Whereas family service learning activities provide opportunities for families to 
        improve essential skills, such as organization, research, planning, 
        reading and writing, technology, teamwork, and sharing;
Whereas families participating together in service are afforded quality time 
        learning about their communities;
Whereas adults engaged in family service learning serve as positive role models 
        for their children;
Whereas family service learning projects enable families to build substantive 
        connections with their communities, develop a stronger sense of self-
        worth, experience a reduction in social isolation, and improve parenting 
        skills;
Whereas family service learning has added benefits for English language learners 
        by helping individuals and families to--

    (1) feel more connected with their communities; and

    (2) practice language skills;

Whereas family service learning is particularly important for at-risk families 
        because it--

    (1) provides opportunities for leadership and civic engagement; and

    (2) helps build the capacity to advocate for the needs of children and 
families; and

Whereas the value that parents place on civic engagement and relationships 
        within the community has been shown to transfer to the child who, in 
        turn, replicates values, such as responsibility, empathy, and caring for 
        others: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of the week of September 12 
        through September 16, 2016, as ``National Family Service 
        Learning Week'' to raise public awareness about the importance 
        of family service learning, family literacy, community service, 
        and 2-generational learning experiences;
            (2) encourages people across the United States to support 
        family service learning and community development programs;
            (3) recognizes the importance that family service learning 
        plays in cultivating family literacy, civic engagement, and 
        community investment; and
            (4) calls upon public, private, and nonprofit entities to 
        support family service learning opportunities to aid in the 
        advancement of families.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
