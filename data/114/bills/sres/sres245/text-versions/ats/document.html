                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning September 13, 2015, as ``National Direct 
               Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, personal assistants, 
        personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals (in 
        this resolution collectively referred to as ``direct support 
        professionals'') are the primary providers of publicly funded long-term 
        support and services for millions of individuals with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, respectful, and 
        trusting relationship with an individual with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional assists individuals with disabilities with 
        intimate personal care assistance on a daily basis;
Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of individualized 
        support, including--

    (1) preparation of meals;

    (2) helping with medications;

    (3) assisting with bathing, dressing, and other aspects of daily 
living;

    (4) assisting individuals with physical disabilities in accessing their 
environment;

    (5) providing transportation to school, work, religious activities, and 
recreational activities; and

    (6) helping with general daily affairs, such as assisting with 
financial matters, medical appointments, and personal interests;

Whereas direct support professionals provide essential support to help keep 
        individuals with disabilities connected to the families, friends, and 
        communities of the individuals;
Whereas direct support professionals support individuals with disabilities in 
        making choices that lead to meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas direct support professionals are integral to helping individuals with 
        disabilities live successfully in the communities of the individuals, 
        avoiding more costly institutional care;
Whereas the participation of direct support professionals in medical care 
        planning is critical to the successful transition from medical events to 
        post-acute care and long-term support and services;
Whereas many direct support professionals are the primary financial providers 
        for the families of the direct support professionals;
Whereas direct support professionals are a critical element in supporting 
        individuals--

    (1) who receive health care services for severe chronic health 
conditions; and

    (2) with functional limitations;

Whereas direct support professionals are hardworking, taxpaying citizens who 
        provide an important service to individuals with disabilities, yet many 
        direct support professionals continue to earn low wages, receive 
        inadequate benefits, and have limited opportunities for advancement, 
        resulting in high turnover and vacancy rates, adversely affecting the 
        quality of support for, and the safety and health of, individuals with 
        disabilities;
Whereas there is a documented critical and increasing shortage of direct support 
        professionals throughout the United States;
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 
        581 (1999), recognized the importance of community-based services for 
        individuals with disabilities in holding that, under the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), States must provide 
        community-based treatment to individuals with disabilities when--

    (1) the services are appropriate;

    (2) the affected individuals do not oppose community-based treatment; 
and

    (3) community-based treatment can be reasonably accommodated, taking 
into account the resources available to the State and the needs of other 
individuals with disabilities; and

Whereas, in 2015, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in 
        home-based and community-based settings, and this trend is projected to 
        increase over the next decade: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning September 13, 2015, as 
        ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct 
        support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals 
        with disabilities of all ages;
            (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support 
        professionals in supporting individuals with disabilities and 
        their families in the United States;
            (4) commends direct support professionals as integral to 
        the long-term support of and services for individuals with 
        disabilities; and
            (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies affecting individuals with disabilities in the United 
        States depends on the dedication of direct support 
        professionals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
