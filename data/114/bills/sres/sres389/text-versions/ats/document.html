                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 3, 2016

  Mr. Schumer (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating March 6, 2016, as the first annual ``World Lymphedema 
                                 Day''.

Whereas lymphedema is a condition that--

    (1) occurs when--

    G    (A) the natural lymphatic drainage system of the body is damaged, 
blocked, or does not develop properly; and

    G    (B) the lymphatic fluid within a certain area, such as the arm, 
leg, torso, head, or neck, is unable to drain properly;

    (2) results in extreme swelling that impairs mobility and function; and

    (3) can cause pain and significantly impair the quality of life of the 
affected individual;

Whereas the total number of individuals living with or at risk for lymphedema is 
        difficult to establish because lymphedema is underreported and often 
        misdiagnosed;
Whereas the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of lymphedema patients costs 
        healthcare providers and healthcare insurers, including the Medicare 
        program, millions of dollars each year because if lymphedema is left 
        untreated--

    (1) the potential for infection is greatly increased;

    (2) infection may occur in the course of a few hours; and

    (3) immediate treatment on an emergency basis is required;

Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that--

    (1) more than 150,000,000 individuals worldwide have secondary 
lymphedema; and

    (2) 120,000,000 individuals worldwide are infected with lymphatic 
filariasis, which leads to lymphedema;

Whereas Stanford University estimates that as many as 10,000,000 individuals in 
        the United States are affected by lymphedema;
Whereas lymphedema can--

    (1) as primary lymphedema, be inherited and either be present at birth 
or manifest itself later in life; or

    (2) as secondary lymphedema, develop after cancer treatment, radiation 
therapy, major surgery, severe burn, or certain other traumatic injuries, 
including injuries affecting combat-tested veterans of the United States;

Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that a high 
        percentage of elderly cancer survivors will develop lymphedema;
Whereas the National Cancer Institute predicts that, not later than 2020--

    (1) the number of cancer survivors aged 65 or older will increase by 42 
percent; and

    (2) as many as 3,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries that are cancer 
survivors will require treatment for lymphedema;

Whereas lymphedema affects an estimated 15 percent of all cancer survivors and 
        40 percent of all breast cancer patients; and
Whereas, in recognition of the financial, physical, and psychological impact 
        that lymphedema has on each individual afflicted with lymphedema, it is 
        incumbent on the people of the United States to support--

    (1) each courageous individual living and coping with lymphedema, a 
debilitating condition; and

    (2) each caregiver, whether a professional or not a professional, of 
each individual afflicted with lymphedema: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That--
            (1) it is the sense of the Senate that each tireless 
        advocate and healthcare provider that spends much time and many 
        resources battling lymphedema, a painful and destructive 
        condition that affects many individuals, should be recognized; 
        and
            (2) the Senate designates March 6, 2016, as ``World 
        Lymphedema Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
