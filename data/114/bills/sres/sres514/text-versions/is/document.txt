                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating May 5, 2017, as the ``National Day of Awareness for Missing 
                 and Murdered Native Women and Girls''.

Whereas, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Justice, in some 
        tribal communities, American Indian women face murder rates that are 
        more than 10 times the national average;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide 
        was the third leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska 
        Native women between 10 and 24 years of age and the fifth leading cause 
        of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 
        years of age;
Whereas little data exist on the number of missing American Indian and Alaska 
        Native women in the United States;
Whereas, on July 5, 2013, Hanna Harris, a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, 
        was reported missing by her family in Lame Deer, Montana;
Whereas the body of Hanna Harris was found 5 days after she went missing;
Whereas Hanna Harris was determined to have been raped and murdered and the 
        individuals accused of committing those crimes were convicted;
Whereas the case of Hanna Harris is only one example of many similar cases; and
Whereas Hanna Harris was born on May 5, 1992: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 5, 2017, as the ``National Day of 
        Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls''; 
        and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to--
                    (A) commemorate the lives of missing and murdered 
                American Indian and Alaska Native women whose cases are 
                documented and undocumented in public records and the 
                media; and
                    (B) demonstrate solidarity with the families of 
                victims in light of these tragedies.
                                 <all>
