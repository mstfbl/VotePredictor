      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Education Week.

Whereas November 14 through November 18, 2016, marks the 95th annual observance 
        of American Education Week;
Whereas public schools are the backbone of the democracy of the United States, 
        providing young people with the tools they need to maintain the precious 
        values of freedom, civility, and equality;
Whereas, by equipping young people in the United States with both practical 
        skills and broader intellectual abilities, public schools give young 
        people hope for, and access to, a productive future;
Whereas people working in the field of public education, including teachers, 
        higher education faculty and staff, paraeducators, custodians, 
        substitute educators, bus drivers, clerical workers, food service 
        professionals, workers in skilled trades, health and student service 
        workers, security guards, technical employees, and librarians, work 
        tirelessly to serve children and communities throughout the United 
        States with care and professionalism; and
Whereas public schools are community linchpins, bringing together adults, 
        children, educators, volunteers, business leaders, and elected officials 
        in a common enterprise: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Education 
        Week; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        American Education Week by reflecting on the positive impact of 
        all those who work together to educate children.
                                 <all>
