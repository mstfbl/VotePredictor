                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the historic achievement of astronaut Scott Joseph Kelly of 
 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as the first person 
 of the United States to complete a continuous 1-year mission in space.

Whereas Scott Joseph Kelly was born on February 21, 1964, to Richard and 
        Patricia Kelly in Orange, New Jersey, and raised in West Orange, New 
        Jersey;
Whereas Scott Kelly received--

    (1) a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the 
State University of New York Maritime College in 1987; and

    (2) a Master of Science degree in aviation systems from the University 
of Tennessee in 1996;

Whereas in July 1989, Scott Kelly was designated as a naval aviator in Beeville, 
        Texas, and subsequently made overseas deployments aboard the USS Dwight 
        D. Eisenhower to--

    (1) the North Atlantic Ocean;

    (2) the Mediterranean Sea;

    (3) the Red Sea; and

    (4) the Persian Gulf;

Whereas since completing training at the United States Naval Test Pilot School 
        in June 1994, Scott Kelly has--

    (1) logged over 8,000 hours in not fewer than 40 different aircraft and 
spacecraft; and

    (2) made not fewer than 250 carrier landings;

Whereas in 2012, Scott Kelly retired from the Navy as a captain;
Whereas since being selected by the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration (referred to in this preamble as ``NASA'') for astronaut 
        training in 1996, Scott Kelly has served--

    (1) in 1999, as a pilot of the Space Shuttle Discovery on STS-103 to 
service the Hubble Space Telescope;

    (2) in 2007, as Mission Commander of the Space Shuttle Endeavor on STS-
118 to the International Space Station (referred to in this preamble as the 
``ISS'');

    (3) as a flight engineer for ISS Expedition 25;

    (4) as the Commander of ISS Expedition 26; and

    (5) as a 1-year crew member of ISS Expeditions 43, 44, 45, and 46, 
including 6 months of service as Commander;

Whereas, on March 27, 2015, Scott Kelly launched into space for a 340-day 
        mission aboard the ISS;
Whereas during his 340-day voyage aboard the ISS, Scott Kelly--

    (1) remained in continuous orbit around the Earth;

    (2) achieved the longest continuous amount of time that a United States 
astronaut has spent living in space;

    (3) in addition to his regular duties of ISS maintenance, participated 
in hundreds of scientific studies; and

    (4) conducted 3 space walks;

Whereas Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his 
        identical twin brother, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a 
        human control specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the 
        physical, behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction of the 
        human body to an extended period of time in space, which could--

    (1) be pivotal for the United States goal for humans to explore Mars; 
and

    (2) contribute to unforeseen scientific innovations that benefit all of 
humanity;

Whereas the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly--

    (1) generated new insight into how the human body adjusts to 
weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and the stress of long-duration space 
flight; and

    (2) will help support astronaut physical and mental well-being during 
longer space exploration missions in the future;

Whereas Scott Kelly completed the 340-day mission with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail 
        Kornienko, embodying peaceful international cooperation in outer space;
Whereas, on March 1, 2016, Scott Kelly touched down on Earth, ending his 340-day 
        space voyage; and
Whereas the 1-year mission of Scott Kelly marks a significant step in reaching 
        the goals of NASA of future missions to Mars, elsewhere in the solar 
        system, and beyond: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration astronaut Scott Kelly for--
                    (A) the historic achievement in completing a 1-year 
                mission in space; and
                    (B) a successful return to Earth, the United 
                States, and his family;
            (2) recognizes that--
                    (A) the 1-year mission of Scott Kelly contributed 
                to research on the effects of long-duration space 
                flight on the human body and mind; and
                    (B) continuing studies of human health are critical 
                to future human exploration of space; and
            (3) applauds the contributions of the 1-year journey in 
        space of Scott Kelly to the scientific progress of the United 
        States.
                                 <all>
