    Recognizing that for nearly 40 years, the United States and the 
  Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have worked toward 
          stability, prosperity, and peace in Southeast Asia.

Whereas the February 2016 U.S.-ASEAN summit at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, 
        California, is an opportunity to deepen the United States-ASEAN 
        partnership;
Whereas the United States and the Association of South East Asian Nations 
        (ASEAN) established dialogue relations on September 10, 1977, with the 
        issuing of the 1977 Joint Communique of the First ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue, 
        and the United States acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in 
        Southeast Asia (TAC) at the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference Session 
        with the United States in Thailand on July 22, 2009;
Whereas the United States was the first non-ASEAN country to appoint an 
        ambassador to ASEAN on April 29, 2008, and the first dialogue partner to 
        establish a permanent mission to ASEAN in 2010;
Whereas the United States has supported efforts to strengthen the ASEAN 
        Secretariat and expand its role in providing greater coordination 
        between and enhancing the effectiveness of regional institutions;
Whereas the first-ever U.S.-ASEAN Defense Forum was held on April 1, 2014, in 
        Honolulu, Hawaii, further deepening ties on the challenges to security, 
        peace, and prosperity in the region, and on November 21, 2015, the 
        United States and ASEAN elevated their relationship to the ASEAN-U.S. 
        Strategic Partnership in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at the 3rd U.S.-ASEAN 
        summit;
Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and ASEAN can help 
        realize their common vision of a peaceful, prosperous, rules-based Asia-
        Pacific region that offers security, opportunity, and dignity to all of 
        its citizens;
Whereas ASEAN is the 7th largest economy in the world, at $2,400,000,000,000, 
        representing the United States 4th largest export market with total-two 
        way trade in goods and services reaching $254,000,000,000 and accounting 
        for more than 500,000 jobs in the United States, and it represents a 
        diverse group of nations and dynamic economies with an expanding 
        workforce, a growing middle class, and a diverse set of skills, 
        cultures, and resources;
Whereas ASEAN is home to critical global sea lanes located at the center of the 
        world's strongest economic growth area, with $5,300,000,000,000 of 
        global trade and more than half of total shipped tonnage transiting 
        through ASEAN's sea lanes each year;
Whereas the United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation and 
        overflight, open access to Asia's maritime commons, and respect for 
        international law in the South China Sea;
Whereas the South China Sea represents a critical international waterway not 
        just for the region but the entire world;
Whereas the United States does not take sides on the competing territorial 
        disputes, but believes claimants should pursue their territorial claims 
        without resort to coercion, and through collaborative diplomacy, 
        including international arbitration, and in accordance with 
        international law and institutions;
Whereas the United States opposes all claims in the maritime domain that impinge 
        on the rights, freedoms, and lawful use of the sea that belongs to all 
        nations and upholds the principles that territorial and maritime claims, 
        including territorial waters or territorial seas, must be derived from 
        land features and otherwise comport with international law;
Whereas the United States supports the Philippines' decision to use arbitration 
        under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), done 
        at Montego Bay December 10, 1982, to peacefully and lawfully address 
        competing territorial claims;
Whereas the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) 
        was signed by all members of ASEAN and the People's Republic of China on 
        November 4, 2002, and the United States supports efforts by ASEAN and 
        the People's Republic of China to develop an effective Code of Conduct 
        (COC), encourages claimants not to undertake new or unilateral attempts 
        to change the status quo since the signing of the 2002 Declaration of 
        Conduct, including reclamation activities or asserting administrative 
        measures or controls in disputed areas in the South China Sea; and 
        supports efforts to fully and effectively implement the Declaration of 
        Conduct in its entirety and to work toward the expeditious conclusion of 
        an effective Code of Conduct;
Whereas the United States has invested significantly in maritime security 
        capacity building with allies and partners in ASEAN to respond to 
        threats in waters off their coasts and to provide maritime security more 
        broadly across the region;
Whereas the United States, as a longstanding Asia-Pacific power, will maintain 
        and exercise freedom of operations in the international waters and 
        airspace in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains, which are critical to the 
        prosperity, stability, and security of ASEAN and the entire Asia-Pacific 
        region;
Whereas ASEAN is a partner to the United States on key transnational challenges, 
        such as terrorism, violent extremism, climate change, environmental 
        degradation and pollution, energy, infectious diseases, disarmament,

        in persons, illicit trafficking of wildlife and timber and illegal, 
        unregulated, and unreported fishing;
Whereas the United States, ASEAN, and other Dialogue Partners, through the 2015 
        East Asia Summit, adopted a statement on transnational cyber issues, 
        emphasizing the importance of regional cooperation to improve the 
        security and stability of cyber networks which sets an important 
        precedent for strengthening practical cooperation, risk reduction, and 
        confidence building in cyberspace;
Whereas the 2015 East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur adopted a statement on 
        countering violent extremism, where the United States, ASEAN, and other 
        Dialogue Partner leaders sent a clear signal of the region's 
        determination to tackle challenges posed by the Islamic State of Iraq 
        and Syria and other violent extremist groups, and to respond to their 
        efforts to spread their ideology of violence and terrorism;
Whereas 2015 East Asia Summit leaders also adopted a statement on health 
        security in responding to diseases with pandemic potential, which 
        committed the region to improve health surveillance systems in each 
        nation, and emphasized the importance of information sharing to promote 
        early detention and response to potential pandemics;
Whereas all members at the 2015 East Asia Summit adopted a statement on maritime 
        cooperation, including preventing incidents at sea, illegal, unreported 
        and unregulated fishing, irregular migration, piracy, and to collaborate 
        on protecting the marine environment;
Whereas changes in climatic conditions in the ASEAN region over the past four 
        decades have resulted in major loss and damage throughout the ASEAN 
        region with a disproportionate impact on developing countries, with the 
        experiences of Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar and Typhoon Haiyan in the 
        Philippines providing stark evidence of the destructive impacts on the 
        region;
Whereas conservation and sustainable management of forests throughout ASEAN play 
        an important role in helping to mitigate changes in the climate, reduce 
        the risks of extreme weather events and other climate-driven disasters, 
        and provide sustainable economic livelihood opportunities for local 
        communities;
Whereas the United States will pursue initiatives that are consistent with 
        broader sustainable development, including the achievement of food 
        security and poverty alleviation throughout the ASEAN region, and build 
        on cooperative efforts outlined at the 2014 ASEAN-U.S. Summit to further 
        tackle this global challenge;

Whereas the United States is the largest investor in Southeast Asia, almost 
        $190,000,000,000 in 2012, creating millions of jobs in the United States 
        and in ASEAN Member States, while investment in the United States from 
        Southeast Asia has increased more than from any other region in the past 
        decade;

        trained 3,500 small to medium enterprises, with nearly half of the

Whereas the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Program has now engaged over 60,000 
        people between the ages of 18 and 35 across all 10 ASEAN nations to
