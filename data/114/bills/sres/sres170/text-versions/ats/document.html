Supporting the goals and ideals of National Travel and Tourism Week and 
honoring the valuable contributions of travel and tourism to the United 
                                States.

Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week was established in 1983 through the 
        enactment of the Joint Resolution entitled ``Joint Resolution to 
        designate the week beginning May 27, 1984, as `National Tourism Week''', 
        approved November 29, 1983 (Public Law 98-178; 97 Stat. 1126), which 
        recognized the value of travel and tourism;
Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week is celebrated across the United States 
        from May 2 through May 10, 2015;
Whereas more than 120 travel destinations throughout the United States are 
        holding events in honor of National Travel and Tourism Week;
Whereas 1 out of every 9 jobs in the United States depends on travel and 
        tourism, and the industry supports 15,000,000 jobs in the United States;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry employs individuals in all 50 States, 
        the District of Columbia, and all the territories of the United States;
Whereas international travel to the United States is the single largest export 
        industry in the country, generating a trade surplus balance of 
        approximately $74,000,000,000;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry, Congress, and the President have worked 
        to streamline the visa process and make the United States welcoming to 
        visitors from other countries;
Whereas travel and tourism provide significant economic benefits to the United 
        States by generating nearly $2,100,000,000,000 in annual economic 
        output;
Whereas leisure travel allows individuals to experience the rich cultural 
        heritage and educational opportunities of the United States and its 
        communities; and
Whereas the immense value of travel and tourism cannot be overstated: Now, 
        therefore, be it

        States.
