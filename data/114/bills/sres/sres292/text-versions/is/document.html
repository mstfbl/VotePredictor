                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate that the availability of high-
       quality childcare for working parents should be increased.

Whereas working parents depend on high-quality childcare so they can work and 
        support their families;
Whereas over 60 percent of children under 5, and \1/2\ of grade school-aged 
        children, are in a regular childcare arrangement;
Whereas United States businesses lose $3,000,000,000 annually due to employee 
        absenteeism resulting from child care challenges, which weakens the 
        stable and reliable childcare system that is essential for the economy;
Whereas childcare is difficult to find for millions of families, particularly 
        the nearly 9,000,000 parents who work non-standard hours, because only 8 
        percent of childcare centers provide evening or weekend care;
Whereas most middle-class families struggle to afford high-quality childcare;
Whereas the median annual aggregate cost of full-time care for an infant and a 
        4-year-old in a childcare center is nearly $16,000;
Whereas the average annual cost of center-based childcare for an infant is over 
        \1/2\ of the income of a family of 3 living at the poverty level in 21 
        States;
Whereas high-quality childcare and early education, especially for disadvantaged 
        children, helps children thrive in school and beyond by--

    (1) decreasing special education placement and reducing grade 
retention;

    (2) decreasing child abuse and neglect and juvenile arrests;

    (3) increasing high school graduation and college attendance; and

    (4) increasing employment;

Whereas the eligibility requirements to receive assistance under the Child Care 
        and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.) 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``CCDBG''), the primary source of 
        Federal funding support for childcare, exclude most United States 
        children from Federal childcare assistance;
Whereas the CCDBG serves only a fraction of families eligible for Federal 
        support, with only 17 percent of eligible children receiving Federal 
        childcare assistance, the lowest percentage since 1997;
Whereas these issues affect all families, but disproportionately affect women 
        because--

    (1) over 95 percent of the formal childcare workforce is comprised of 
women; and

    (2) women do most of the unpaid childcare work in families;

Whereas increased pay for workers in the childcare industry improves the quality 
        of childcare for young children;
Whereas to recruit and retain a qualified childcare workforce for young 
        children, childcare staff for young children should be paid as much as 
        K-12 staff with equivalent education and experience;
Whereas a full-time living wage of at least $15 per hour is needed for childcare 
        workers to meet the essential needs of their families, but the average 
        childcare center worker earns $10.60 per hour and has experienced no 
        increase in real earnings since 1997;
Whereas high-quality childcare that works for everyone is essential for a strong 
        economy and future;
Whereas each working family needs, in order to support its well-being--

    (1) universal preschool;

    (2) child nutrition programs that promote health and wellness;

    (3) a fair work schedule;

    (4) a living wage;

    (5) paid family and medical leave;

    (6) paid sick days; and

    (7) credit in the Social Security system for time spent caregiving; and

Whereas when families are guaranteed high-quality, flexible, available, and 
        affordable childcare--

    (1) business productivity improves;

    (2) parents have a greater likelihood of finding and keeping 
employment; and

    (3) children do better in school and in life: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate supports efforts--
            (1) to provide childcare assistance to each working family 
        that needs childcare assistance, including--
                    (A) middle-class families that struggle to afford 
                the costs of high-quality childcare; and
                    (B) underpaid families that are often left behind;
            (2) to make childcare affordable--
                    (A) such that no working family must pay more than 
                10 percent of its income for childcare; and
                    (B) by providing additional help to families most 
                in need;
            (3) to ensure that childcare is available so that parents 
        in the 24-hour economy can access high-quality care--
                    (A) when and where the parents need it (during 
                weekends, nights, and as their job schedules change); 
                and
                    (B) with options across school, center, and home 
                settings;
            (4) to guarantee that each family eligible for childcare 
        receives childcare by creating a system that expands with need;
            (5) to improve the quality of childcare by--
                    (A) guaranteeing childcare workers a living wage 
                and wage parity with K-12 staff with equivalent 
                education and experience;
                    (B) improving training opportunities; and
                    (C) giving workers a voice on the job to advocate 
                for higher workplace standards and standards of care 
                for the children the workers serve; and
            (6) to provide sufficient Federal, State, and local 
        investment to ensure resources for high-quality jobs and 
        affordable childcare.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
