                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 27, 2016

 Mr. Schumer submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                     the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating April 2016 as ``National Sarcoidosis Awareness Month''.

Whereas sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect almost any organ 
        of the body, but most commonly affects the lungs;
Whereas sarcoidosis causes the immune system to overreact, causing damage to 
        tissue in the form of granulomas, which are microscopic clumps of 
        inflammatory cells, and interference with the functioning of an organ 
        when too many granulomas form in that organ;
Whereas sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder, which means that symptoms vary 
        depending on which organ is affected, and \1/3\ of individuals diagnosed 
        with sarcoidosis will experience damage to multiple organs;
Whereas the cause of sarcoidosis is unknown;
Whereas sarcoidosis is classified as a rare disease, but there are an estimated 
        200,000 individuals in the United States who live with sarcoidosis;
Whereas sarcoidosis affects all demographics, regardless of age, race, or 
        gender, but is most common among adults between the ages of 20 and 40 
        and more likely to be severe and chronic in African-Americans;
Whereas sarcoidosis was the first diagnosis for an overwhelming majority of 
        rescue workers responding to the site of the attacks on September 11, 
        2001;
Whereas sarcoidosis patients are often left undertreated or misdiagnosed due to 
        the diverse presentation of sarcoidosis, the lack of knowledge of 
        sarcoidosis among some physicians, and the diagnosis of sarcoidosis 
        through exclusions;
Whereas the average time it takes to diagnose sarcoidosis is 7 years, and many 
        sarcoidosis patients struggle to find knowledgeable physicians and 
        emotional support resources relating to sarcoidosis;
Whereas treatment options for sarcoidosis are limited due in part to the lack of 
        informative research and funding specific to sarcoidosis;
Whereas the Sarcoidosis of Long Island and the Foundation for Sarcoidosis 
        Research--

    (1) actively advocate for more research to better understand how 
environmental or occupational exposures may increase the risk of 
sarcoidosis; and

    (2) strive to serve individuals afflicted by sarcoidosis by focusing 
efforts relating to sarcoidosis on public policy, research, funding, 
patient services, public awareness, education, and finding a cure; and

Whereas April 2016 is appropriate to designate as ``National Sarcoidosis 
        Awareness Month'', with worldwide events--

    (1) to increase public awareness of the need to support individuals 
with sarcoidosis;

    (2) to raise awareness of the environmental and occupational issues 
associated with sarcoidosis; and

    (3) to educate medical professionals who care for individuals with 
sarcoidosis: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Sarcoidosis 
        Awareness Month''; and
            (2) designates April 2016 as ``National Sarcoidosis 
        Awareness Month''.
