                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the third Tuesday in November as 
                    ``National Entrepreneurs' Day''.

Whereas, since the founding of the United States, innovation, creativity, 
        industriousness, and entrepreneurship have formed the economic fiber of 
        the United States;
Whereas entrepreneurs have long been vital to the economic growth of the United 
        States by advancing innovation, improving productivity, and creating 
        jobs;
Whereas the willingness of entrepreneurs to assume risk has resulted in 
        unparalleled contributions to the development of the United States;
Whereas entrepreneur-led innovation has built and continues to sustain a 
        critical United States competitive advantage;
Whereas more than 400,000 new businesses were created in the United States in 
        2013;
Whereas research shows that businesses 5 years or younger were responsible for 
        nearly every net new job in the economy of the United States between 
        1982 and 2011;
Whereas entrepreneurs and the businesses created by entrepreneurs accounted for 
        the creation of nearly 2,300,000 jobs in 2013;
Whereas, despite economic instability, over 50 percent of the population of the 
        United States believes good opportunities exist for starting businesses 
        and, in 2014, entrepreneurship rose to its highest level in 16 years, 
        indicating that entrepreneurial spirit remains strong in the United 
        States;
Whereas collaboration and cooperation among a broad coalition of organizations, 
        including nonprofit entrepreneurial incubators, angel investors, venture 
        capitalists, crowd-funding initiatives, and other early-stage investors, 
        catalyze entrepreneurial ventures;
Whereas the Federal Government must continue to promote entrepreneurship in all 
        communities by ensuring that entrepreneurs find the necessary resources 
        to pursue their ideas;
Whereas support for all entrepreneurs, including women and minorities, who own 
        and manage businesses of all sizes, from sole proprietorships to large 
        enterprises, strengthens the overall economy of the United States;
Whereas entrepreneurial literacy skills serve as one of the 21st-century content 
        areas critical to success in communities and workplaces;
Whereas 54 percent of young people (ages 18-34) in the United States envision 
        starting a business or have already started a business;
Whereas positive outcomes for youth who participate in entrepreneurship 
        education programs include improved academic performance, increased 
        critical thinking skills, and heightened occupational aspirations;
Whereas, to maintain the position of the United States as a world economic 
        leader, government, entrepreneurs, institutions of higher education, and 
        businesses of all sizes must be united in a comprehensive effort to 
        welcome and cultivate entrepreneurial activities in the United States;
Whereas entrepreneurs face various barriers that the Federal Government must 
        work to reduce so that all entrepreneurs in the United States have a 
        chance at success;
Whereas entrepreneurship remains a strong path for economic progress for all 
        people of the United States; and
Whereas the third Tuesday in November would be an appropriate date to designate 
        as ``National Entrepreneurs' Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Entrepreneurs' 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the considerable contributions of 
        entrepreneurs to the United States; and
            (3) honors those entrepreneurs who ignite innovation and 
        inspire the next generation.
                                 <all>
