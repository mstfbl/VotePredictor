Expressing the sense of Senate that individuals captured by the United 
 States for supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant should 
   be detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has 
        declared war on the United States;
            (2) the United States Armed Forces are currently engaged in 
        combat operations against ISIL;
            (3) in conducting combat operations against ISIL, the 
        United States has captured and detained individuals associated 
        with ISIL and will likely capture and hold additional ISIL 
        detainees;
            (4) following the horrific terrorist attacks on September 
        11, 2001, the United States determined that it would detain at 
        United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, individuals 
        who had engaged in, aided, or abetted, or conspired to commit, 
        acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation 
        therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their 
        aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United 
        States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or 
        economy;
            (5) members of ISIL captured by the United States during 
        combat operations against ISIL meet such criteria for continued 
        detention at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay; and
            (6) all individuals captured by the United States during 
        combat operations against ISIL that meet such criteria by their 
        affiliation with ISIL must be detained outside the United 
        States and its territories and should be transferred to United 
        States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay.
                                 <all>
