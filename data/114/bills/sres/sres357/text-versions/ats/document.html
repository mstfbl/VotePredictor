                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the goals of Catholic Schools Week and honoring the 
    valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States.

Whereas Catholic schools in the United States are internationally acclaimed for 
        their academic excellence and provide students with more than an 
        exceptional scholastic education;
Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, values-based education, emphasizing 
        the lifelong development of moral, intellectual, physical, and social 
        values in young people in the United States;
Whereas Catholic schools provide a high level of service to the United States by 
        providing a strong academic and moral foundation to a diverse student 
        population from all regions of the country and all socioeconomic 
        backgrounds;
Whereas Catholic schools produce students who are strongly dedicated to their 
        faith, values, families, and communities, by providing an intellectually 
        stimulating environment that is rich in spiritual, character, and moral 
        development;
Whereas Catholic schools are committed to community service, producing graduates 
        who hold ``helping others'' as a core value;
Whereas the total student enrollment in Catholic schools in the United States 
        for the 2015-2016 academic year is almost 2,000,000 and the student-to-
        teacher ratio is 13.1 to 1;
Whereas Catholic schools in the United States educate a diverse population of 
        students, of which 20.4 percent belong to racial minorities, 15.3 
        percent are of Hispanic or Latino origin, and 16.9 percent are non-
        Catholics;
Whereas the Catholic high school graduation rate in the United States is 99 
        percent, with 85 percent of graduates attending a 4-year college;
Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic education, the United 
        States Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, ``Education is one of the 
        most important ways by which the Church fulfills its commitment to the 
        dignity of the person and building of community. Community is central to 
        education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an ardently 
        desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, therefore, must be 
        directed to forming persons-in-community; for the education of the 
        individual Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny, but 
        also the destinies of the many communities in which he lives.'';
Whereas the week of January 31, 2016, to February 6, 2016, has been designated 
        as ``National Catholic Schools Week'' by the National Catholic 
        Educational Association and the United States Conference of Catholic 
        Bishops;
Whereas the National Catholic Schools Week was first established in 1974 and has 
        been celebrated annually for the past 42 years; and
Whereas the theme for National Catholic Schools Week 2016 is ``Catholic Schools: 
        Communities of Faith, Knowledge, and Service'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals of National Catholic Schools Week, 
        an event cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational 
        Association and the United States Conference of Catholic 
        Bishops and established to recognize the vital contributions of 
        the thousands of Catholic elementary and secondary schools in 
        the United States; and
            (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and 
        teachers across the United States for ongoing contributions to 
        education and for playing a vital role in promoting and 
        ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
