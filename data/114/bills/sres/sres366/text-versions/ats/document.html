Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of Lunar New Year.

Whereas Lunar New Year begins on the second new moon following the winter 
        solstice, or the first day of the new year according to the lunisolar 
        calendar, and extends until the full moon 15 days later;
Whereas February 8, 2016, marks the first day of Lunar New Year for calendar 
        year 2016;
Whereas the 15th day of the new year, according to the lunisolar calendar, is 
        called the Lantern Festival;
Whereas Lunar New Year is often referred to as ``Spring Festival'' in various 
        Asian countries;
Whereas many religious and ethnic communities use lunar-based calendars;
Whereas Lunar New Year began in China more than 4,000 years ago and is widely 
        celebrated in East and Southeast Asia;
Whereas the Asian diaspora has expanded the Lunar New Year celebration into an 
        annual worldwide event;
Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated by millions of Asian Americans, and by many 
        non-Asian Americans, in the United States;
Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated with community activities and cultural 
        performances;
Whereas participants celebrating Lunar New Year travel to spend the holiday 
        reuniting with family and friends; and
Whereas Lunar New Year is traditionally a time to wish others good fortune, 
        health, prosperity, and happiness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--

        Lunar New Year;
            (2) in observance of Lunar New Year, expresses its deepest 
        respect for Asian Americans and all individuals throughout the 
        world who celebrate this significant occasion; and
            (3) wishes Asian Americans and all individuals who observe 
        this holiday a happy and prosperous new year.
