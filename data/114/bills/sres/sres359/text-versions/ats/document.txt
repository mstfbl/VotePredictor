Whereas the Air and Marine Operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection

Whereas, 10 years before the date of adoption of this resolution, U.S. Customs 
        and Border Protection (referred to in this preamble as ``CBP'') 
        integrated the marine assets of CBP with the aircraft fleet of CBP to

        competencies of AMO, which include--

    (1) interdiction;

    (2) investigation;

    (3) domain awareness; and

    (4) contingency operations and national tasking missions;

Whereas AMO conducts the mission of AMO along the land borders and maritime 
        approaches of the United States from more than 90 locations throughout 
        the United States and Puerto Rico, with--

    (1) 1,800 Federal agents and specialists;

    (2) a fleet of more than 250 aircraft and more than 280 marine vessels; 
and

    (3) an array of surveillance and domain awareness technologies; and

Whereas AMO has leveraged the capabilities of AMO by forging crucial 
        partnerships with Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies, and the 
        United States Armed Forces, for--

    (1) law enforcement;

    (2) disaster relief;

    (3) humanitarian operations;

    (4) joint operations; and

    (5) National Special Security Events: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 10th anniversary of the unification of 
        the air and marine assets of U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
        to establish the Air and Marine Operations of U.S. Customs and

        Operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to--

                Border Protection; and
                    (B) the multilayered approach to homeland security 
                by the Department of Homeland Security; and
            (3) commends the agents and mission support staff of the 
        Air and Marine Operations of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection, who are dedicated to serving and protecting--
