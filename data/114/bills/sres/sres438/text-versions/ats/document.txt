_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating September 2016 as ``National Brain Aneurysm Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas a brain aneurysm is an abnormal saccular or fusiform bulging of an 
        artery in the brain;
Whereas an estimated 1 out of every 50 individuals in the United States has a 
        brain aneurysm;
Whereas brain aneurysms are most likely to occur in individuals between the ages 
        of 35 and 60;
Whereas there are typically no warning signs before the occurrence of a brain 
        aneurysm;
Whereas brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in women than in men by a 3 to 
        2 ratio;
Whereas young and middle-aged African-Americans have a higher risk of brain 
        aneurysm rupture compared to Caucasians in the United States;
Whereas, based on a 2004 study (the most recent year with readily available 
        data), the combined lost wages of survivors of a brain aneurysm rupture 
        and the caretakers of the survivors for 1 year were $138,000,000;
Whereas various risk factors can contribute to the formation of a brain 
        aneurysm, including smoking, hypertension, and a family history of brain 
        aneurysms;
Whereas approximately 6,000,000 individuals in the United States have a brain 
        aneurysm;
Whereas an unruptured brain aneurysm can lead to double vision, vision loss, 
        loss of sensation, weakness, loss of balance, incoordination, and speech 
        problems;
Whereas a brain aneurysm is often discovered when it ruptures and causes a 
        subarachnoid hemorrhage;
Whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to brain damage, hydrocephalus, 
        stroke, and death;
Whereas, each year, more than 30,000 individuals in the United States suffer 
        from ruptured brain aneurysms, 50 percent of whom die as a result;
Whereas, annually, between 3,000 and 4,500 individuals in the United States with 
        ruptured brain aneurysms die before reaching the hospital;
Whereas a number of advancements have been made in recent years regarding the 
        detection of brain aneurysms, including the computerized tomography 
        scan, the magnetic resonance imaging test, and the cerebral arteriogram;
Whereas early detection of brain aneurysms can save lives;
Whereas various research studies are currently being conducted in the United 
        States in order to better understand, prevent, and treat brain 
        aneurysms;
Whereas the United States spends only $1.30 per individual for research on brain 
        aneurysms each year for the approximately 6,000,000 individuals in the 
        United States who suffer from brain aneurysms;
Whereas the Brain Aneurysm Foundation, a nonprofit organization, remains a 
        globally recognized leader for brain aneurysm awareness, education, 
        support, advocacy, and research funding; and
Whereas the month of September is an appropriate month to designate as 
        ``National Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 2016 as ``National Brain Aneurysm 
        Awareness Month''; and
            (2) continues to support research to prevent, to detect, 
        and to treat brain aneurysms.
                                 <all>
