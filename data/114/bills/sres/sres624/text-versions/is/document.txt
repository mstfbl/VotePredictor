                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals, activities, and ideals of World Prematurity 
                                 Month.

Whereas, according to the World Health Organization, complications from preterm 
        birth are the world's leading killer of children younger than 5 years of 
        age;
Whereas preterm birth is a global problem, exacting a harsh toll on families 
        from all parts of society in every country;
Whereas, in 2015, complications from preterm birth accounted for 1,000,000 
        deaths of children younger than 5 years of age worldwide;
Whereas there are stark inequalities with respect to the survival rates of 
        preterm babies born around the world;
Whereas up to 75 percent of deaths resulting from preterm birth worldwide could 
        be prevented through proven low-cost interventions;
Whereas countries can improve maternal health and the survival rate of babies 
        born prematurely by making strategic investments in health care systems 
        to ensure access to--

    (1) high quality prenatal and postnatal care;

    (2) quality childbirth services;

    (3) emergency obstetric care; and

    (4) comprehensive care for affected newborns;

Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, premature 
        birth is the leading contributor to infant death in the United States 
        and poses the risk of lifelong health problems for babies who survive;
Whereas, while the preterm birth rate in the United States decreased from a peak 
        of 12.8 percent in 2006 to 9.6 percent in 2015, the rate remains too 
        high;
Whereas many communities in the United States experience significant racial and 
        ethnic disparities in preterm birth rates;
Whereas, in 2005, the Institute of Medicine estimated that the annual societal 
        economic cost associated with preterm birth in the United States was 
        $26,200,000,000; and
Whereas preterm births can be prevented through evidence-based public health 
        programs, including through the reduction of risk factors, such as 
        tobacco use and early elective deliveries, and the promotion of healthy 
        timing and spacing of pregnancy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes November 2016 as ``World Prematurity 
        Month'';
            (2) supports efforts in the United States, and recognizes 
        efforts abroad, to--
                    (A) reduce the impact of preterm births by 
                improving maternal health; and
                    (B) advance the care and treatment of infants who 
                are born preterm; and
            (3) honors individuals working in the United States and 
        internationally to reduce the number of preterm births.
                                 <all>
