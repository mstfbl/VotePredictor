  Designating October 30, 2016, as a national day of remembrance for 
                    nuclear weapons program workers.

Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women, including 
        uranium miners, millers, and haulers, have served the United States by 
        building nuclear weapons for the defense of the United States;
Whereas dedicated workers paid a high price for developing a nuclear weapons 
        program at the service, and for the benefit of, the United States, 
        including by developing disabling or fatal illnesses;
Whereas the Senate recognized the contributions, services, and sacrifices that 
        those patriotic men and women made for the defense of the United States 
        in--

    (1) Senate Resolution 151, 111th Congress, agreed to May 20, 2009;

    (2) Senate Resolution 653, 111th Congress, agreed to September 28,

    (7) Senate Resolution 213, 114th Congress, agreed to September 25, 
2015;

Whereas a national day of remembrance time capsule has been crossing the United 
        States, collecting stories and artifacts of nuclear weapons program 
        workers relating to the nuclear defense era of the United States, and a 
        remembrance quilt has been constructed to memorialize the contribution 
        of those workers;
Whereas the stories and artifacts reflected in the time capsule and the 
        remembrance quilt reinforce the importance of recognizing nuclear 
        weapons program workers; and
Whereas those patriotic men and women deserve to be recognized for the 
        contributions, services, and sacrifices they made for the defense of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 30, 2016, as a national day of 
        remembrance for the nuclear weapons program workers of the 
        United States, including the uranium miners, millers, and 
        haulers; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
        and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other 
        activities to commemorate October 30, 2016, as a national day 
        of remembrance for past and present workers in the nuclear 
        weapons program of the United States.
