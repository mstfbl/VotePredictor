                               RESOLUTION


 
         Honoring the 70th anniversary of the founding of CARE.

Whereas CARE is one of the largest and most respected international development 
        and emergency aid organizations in the world;
Whereas CARE was officially founded on November 27, 1945, which is 70 years 
        prior to the month of adoption of this resolution;
Whereas the United States sent 100,000,000 CARE packages to Europe during World 
        War II, which--

    (1) delivered canned meats, powdered milk, dried fruits, chocolate, and 
coffee to brave soldiers of the United States; and

    (2) each cost only $10 but provided 10 soldiers each 1 meal;

Whereas President Harry Truman purchased the first CARE package;
Whereas CARE was originally intended to be a temporary organization, but CARE--

    (1) continued as the need for global relief continued; and

    (2) grew into an international organization working in 87 countries;

Whereas CARE--

    (1) has significantly broadened the scope of its relief work;

    (2) provides assistance in the wake of devastating natural disasters;

    (3) combats hunger; and

    (4) comes to the assistance of refugees, including refugees of the 
current refugee crisis in Syria;

Whereas CARE also works--

    (1) to empower women and girls;

    (2) to reduce the incidence of child marriage;

    (3) to prevent and respond to gender-based violence; and

    (4) to promote gender equality internationally; and

Whereas the words of President John F. Kennedy, that the work of CARE 
        ``expresses America's concern and friendship in a language that all 
        peoples understand'' are still true today: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 70th anniversary of the 
founding of CARE, which serves as a symbol of hope and humanity 
throughout the world.
                                 <all>
