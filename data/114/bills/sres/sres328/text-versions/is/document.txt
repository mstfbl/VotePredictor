                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            December 3, 2015

    Mr. Udall (for himself and Mrs. Capito) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the December 3, 2015, National Day of Remembrance for 
      victims of drunk and drugged driving and for victims of the 
                   consequences of underage drinking.

Whereas drunk driving is still a leading cause of death and injury on the 
        roadways of the United States and nearly 1 in 3 traffic fatalities 
        involved alcohol-impaired crashes, according to studies conducted by the 
        National Highway Traffic Safety Administration;
Whereas, in 2014, there were 9,967 people killed in alcohol-impaired crashes, 
        representing an average of 27 alcohol-impaired driving fatalities every 
        day and 1 alcohol-impaired driving fatality every 53 minutes;
Whereas countless victims, survivors, families, and loved ones are left to cope 
        with the aftermath of these terrible crashes;
Whereas victims and survivors of drunk and drugged driving and the consequences 
        of underage drinking are cause for concern;
Whereas Mothers Against Drunk Driving (referred to in this preamble as ``MADD'') 
        was founded in 1980 and today continues with the mission to end drunk 
        driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these crimes 
        and crashes, and prevent underage drinking;
Whereas drunk driving deaths have been reduced dramatically since 1980, from 
        more than 25,000 deaths per year to just under 10,000 in 2014, thanks to 
        efforts from MADD, other community organizations, States, schools, law 
        enforcement agencies, safety technologies and programs, improved laws, 
        and growing public recognition of the risks posed by drunk driving;
Whereas combating drunk and drugged driving is a legislative priority for the 
        Senate in the 114th Congress, advancing a multi-year transportation 
        reauthorization bill that provides incentives to States to adopt 
        measures to reduce impaired driving and authorizes impaired driving 
        research and development;
Whereas, on December 3, 2015, MADD locations across the United States will honor 
        those individuals killed, injured, or emotionally devastated by drunk 
        and drugged driving and underage drinking with a National Day of 
        Remembrance; and
Whereas the National Day of Remembrance is a chance for the public to come 
        together in communities across the United States and online to show that 
        the victims and survivors of these senseless tragedies are not alone: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the victims of drunk and drugged driving; and
            (2) recognizes the consequences of underage drinking on the 
        first annual National Day of Remembrance.
                                 <all>
