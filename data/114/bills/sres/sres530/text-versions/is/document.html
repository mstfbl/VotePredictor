                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the termination of the Select Investigative Panel of the 
   Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives 
 established pursuant to House Resolution 461, and for other purposes.

Whereas Planned Parenthood provides high-quality, affordable health care for 
        women, men, and young people, and is the Nation's largest provider of 
        sex education;
Whereas Planned Parenthood provides sexual and reproductive health care, 
        education, information, and outreach to nearly 5,000,000 women, men, and 
        adolescents worldwide in a single year;
Whereas officials in 13 States have concluded investigations into Planned 
        Parenthood affiliates having found no wrongdoing on behalf of Planned 
        Parenthood, and officials in additional eight States have declined to 
        open investigations citing a lack of any evidence against Planned 
        Parenthood to suggest wrongdoing;
Whereas the Select Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
        of the House of Representatives has found no wrongdoing on the part of 
        Planned Parenthood;
Whereas the Select Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
        of the House of Representatives has recently authorized an additional 
        $490,000 in unnecessary spending, bringing the panel's total 
        expenditures to $790,000 thus far;
Whereas the Zika virus is a looming public health emergency across the United 
        States that has been linked to severe birth defects, including 
        microcephaly, in children of women infected during pregnancy;
Whereas the Zika virus is spreading rapidly across the Americas, with the Puerto 
        Rican Department of Health reporting a one-week jump of 40 percent in 
        the number of pregnant women on the island who were diagnosed with Zika;
Whereas family planning services and sex education are the primary tools 
        currently available to directly prevent the devastating outcomes of the 
        Zika virus;
Whereas the Select Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
        of the House of Representatives has turned their focus to investigating 
        scientific researchers engaged in public health research, such as the 
        Zika virus, using fetal tissue; and
Whereas scientific researchers have reported the diminishing availability of 
        fetal tissue for their critical research to try to develop a vaccine for 
        the Zika virus, Alzheimer's, and other diseases impacting Americans: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the immediate termination of the Select 
        Investigative Panel of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of 
        the House of Representatives established pursuant to House 
        Resolution 461, agreed to October 7, 2015; and
            (2) supports rescinding any unspent funds and making those 
        funds available to the Department of Health and Human Services 
        for efforts to combat Zika for women and children.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
