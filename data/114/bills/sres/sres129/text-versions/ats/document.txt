                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating May 4, 2015, as National Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis 
                    Syndrome (FPIES) Awareness Day.

Whereas Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a form of food 
        allergy that primarily affects the gastrointestinal system and adversely 
        impacts the lives of young children throughout the nation;
Whereas children with FPIES may experience acute and severe allergic reactions 
        for which they may require emergency room treatment;
Whereas FPIES patients may suffer chronically from the disorder and develop 
        health issues, such as failure to thrive, long-term feeding problems, 
        and food aversions, for which there is no treatment;
Whereas a diagnosis of FPIES leads to significant dietary restrictions and 
        imposes a substantial reduction in quality of life on children with 
        FPIES and their families;
Whereas families with children who suffer from FPIES are often unaware that the 
        condition exists, and health care providers often misdiagnose the 
        condition or are unaware of available treatment options;
Whereas there is a tremendous need to generate awareness of FPIES to ensure that 
        health care providers are able to quickly and effectively diagnose FPIES 
        and schools and childcare providers are able to effectively care for 
        those who struggle with this condition;
Whereas it is essential that necessary treatment and dietary options be 
        accessible and available to families with children suffering from FPIES; 
        and
Whereas increasing FPIES awareness will encourage all people of the United 
        States to provide comfort to families with children suffering from this 
        condition and collectively work towards finding better treatments: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 4, 2015, as National Food Protein-
        Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) Awareness Day in order 
        to raise awareness and increase understanding of FPIES, 
        highlight research, accurate diagnoses, and effective 
        treatments, and improve the lives of children and families 
        struggling with FPIES; and
            (2) expresses support for all people in the United States 
        living with FPIES, expresses gratitude to the friends and 
        family members who care for them, and salutes the health care 
        professionals, teachers, and other caregivers who provide 
        assistance to those so affected.
                                 <all>
