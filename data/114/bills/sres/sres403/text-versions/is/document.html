                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning April 24, 2016 as ``National Industrial 
  Assessment Center Week'' in celebration of the 40th anniversary of 
                     Industrial Assessment Centers.

Whereas Industrial Assessment Centers (IACs) are university-led programs funded 
        by the Department of Energy that provide energy efficiency assessments 
        to small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises in the United 
        States for improving energy efficiency and reducing water usage and 
        waste;
Whereas IACs increase the energy efficiency, productivity, sustainability, and 
        competitiveness of manufacturers in the United States;
Whereas, since the inception of the IAC program in 1976, IACs have conducted 
        more than 16,000 assessments at manufacturing plants across the United 
        States;
Whereas the assessments conducted by IACs have saved an estimated 
        76,000,000,000,000 British thermal units, a quantity equivalent to 
        meeting the energy needs of almost 1,400,000 homes in the United States;
Whereas IACs have saved participating manufacturers more than $1,000,000,000 in 
        energy costs;
Whereas an estimated 6,000,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions have been 
        avoided due to IAC assessments, a quantity equivalent to the emissions 
        from more than 1,200,000 cars;
Whereas the IAC program equips undergraduate and graduate university students 
        with the skills to conduct energy audits, improving workforce training 
        and cultivating the next generation of energy engineers;
Whereas more than 3,000 students have graduated from the IAC program, with more 
        than 60 percent continuing on to pursue careers in energy-related 
        fields; and
Whereas 2016 marks the 40th anniversary of the IAC program: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning April 24, 2016 as 
        ``National Industrial Assessment Center Week''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Industrial Assessment Center Week with appropriate 
        programs, ceremonies, and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
