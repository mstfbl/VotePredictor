                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding establishing a National 
                           Strategic Agenda.

Whereas the United States needs its leaders to pursue policies in the interest 
        of the United States that are foremost national priorities;
Whereas the United States faces many fiscal and long-term policy challenges that 
        not only threaten the opportunities, hopes, and aspirations of the 
        citizens of the United States, but the overall ability of the United 
        States to be a world leader in bringing peace and stability around the 
        world;
Whereas the United States needs its leaders to unite behind common goals and 
        concrete solutions to create the next generation of growth and 
        opportunity;
Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide both a long-term vision and a 
        priority list, oriented around common goals for the United States, both 
        of which, as of May 2015, do not exist in the Federal Government;
Whereas adopting a National Strategic Agenda would bring a long-term vision to a 
        policymaking process that has become too often dominated by short-term 
        political considerations;
Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide a consistent framework and focus 
        the attention of the Federal Government on the most urgent problems 
        facing the United States;
Whereas millions of people in the United States are currently seeking employment 
        opportunities to improve their lives and provide a better future for 
        their children;
Whereas, as of May 2015, the Federal debt is higher as a percentage of gross 
        domestic product than at any time since World War II and will be an 
        unsustainable burden on future generations if left unaddressed;
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare benefits that millions of people in the 
        United States have earned must be preserved and protected;
Whereas a fiscally responsible solution to secure Social Security and Medicare 
        for future generations is needed now, as waiting longer will further 
        jeopardize the ability to preserve and protect these programs;
Whereas the United States can become energy secure by pursuing an all-of-the-
        above energy plan that develops more affordable and sustainable domestic 
        energy sources, increases energy efficiency, and builds a more reliable 
        and resilient system for energy generation and transmission; and
Whereas the creation and implementation of a new National Strategic Agenda for 
        the United States will require the participation of both the legislative 
        and executive branch along with agreement by all parties to work 
        together: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the 4 goals of the National Strategic Agenda are to--
                    (A) create 25,000,000 new jobs over the next 10 
                years;
                    (B) balance the Federal budget by 2030;
                    (C) secure Medicare and Social Security for the 
                next 75 years; and
                    (D) make the United States energy secure by 2024;
            (2) the Senate should strive to create, debate, and adopt 
        policy solutions to achieve the 4 goals of the National 
        Strategic Agenda to address the national interest and 
        priorities represented by the agenda; and
            (3) in achieving success toward the National Strategic 
        Agenda, the goal of the Senate should be to reach solutions 
        through--
                    (A) collaboration, not division;
                    (B) mutual respect, not partisan bickering; and
                    (C) a commitment to honor the public duty of the 
                Senate to the United States as a body of 
                representatives elected by people across the United 
                States.
                                 <all>
