Whereas August 1, 2016, marks the 70th anniversary of President Harry S. Truman 
        signing into law the Act of August 1, 1946 (60 Stat. 754, chapter 723) 
        (commonly known as the ``Fulbright Act of 1946'');
Whereas the Fulbright Program was established by Senator James William Fulbright 
        of Arkansas for the ``promotion of international good will through the 
        exchange of students in the fields of education, culture, and science'';
Whereas the Fulbright Program is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and 
        Cultural Affairs of the Department of State;
Whereas the Fulbright Program provides approximately 8,000 grants annually and, 
        as of 2016, operates in more than 160 countries, including 50 that have 
        established cost-sharing binational commissions;
Whereas approximately 1,300 institutions of higher education in the United 
        States, both public and private, host students at home and send scholars 
        abroad;
Whereas current Fulbright students and scholars hail from all 50 States and 2 
        United States territories, and approximately a quarter are from minority 
        or underrepresented populations;
Whereas more than 370,000 individuals from across the globe have benefited from 
        this unique opportunity;
Whereas alumni of the Fulbright Program include 54 Nobel Prize laureates, 82 
        recipients of the Pulitzer Prize, 33 heads of state, 16 Presidential 
        Medal of Freedom recipients, 8 members of the United States Congress, 
        and a former Secretary-General of the United Nations;
Whereas, on April 21, 2016, an American Elm was planted on the grounds of the 
        United States Capitol in recognition of the 70th anniversary of the 
        Fulbright Program; and
Whereas the Fulbright Program promotes United States higher education abroad and 
        remains a valuable diplomatic tool: Now, therefore, be it

        Program;
            (2) encourages the President and the Secretary of State to

        and promote international good will.
