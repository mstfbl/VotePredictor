                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing appreciation of the goals of American Craft Beer Week and 
   commending the small and independent craft brewers of the United 
                                States.

Whereas American Craft Beer Week is celebrated annually in breweries, brew pubs, 
        restaurants, and beer stores by craft brewers, home brewers, and beer 
        enthusiasts nationwide;
Whereas in 2015, American Craft Beer Week is celebrated from May 11 to May 17;
Whereas craft brewers are a vibrant affirmation and expression of the 
        entrepreneurial traditions of the United States, operating as community-
        based small businesses, providing employment for 115,000 full- and part-
        time workers, and generating annually more than $3,000,000,000 in wages 
        and benefits;
Whereas the United States has craft brewers in every State and more than 3,500 
        craft breweries nationwide, each producing fewer than 6,000,000 barrels 
        of beer annually;
Whereas in 2014, 615 new breweries opened in the United States, creating jobs 
        and improving economic conditions in communities across the United 
        States;
Whereas in 2014, craft breweries in the United States produced more than 
        22,000,000 barrels of beer, which is 3,300,000 more barrels than craft 
        breweries produced in 2013;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States now export more than 383,000 
        barrels of beer and are establishing new markets abroad, which creates 
        more domestic jobs to meet the growing international demand for craft 
        beer from the United States;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States support United States agriculture 
        by purchasing barley, malt, and hops that are grown, processed, and 
        distributed in the United States;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States produce more than 100 distinct 
        styles of flavorful beers, including many sought-after new and unique 
        styles ranging from smoked porters to pumpkin peach ales that--

    (1) contribute to a favorable balance of trade by reducing United 
States dependence on imported beers;

    (2) support United States exports; and

    (3) promote United States tourism;

Whereas craft beers from the United States consistently win international 
        quality and taste awards;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States strive to educate the people of 
        the United States who are of legal drinking age about the differences in 
        beer flavor, aroma, color, alcohol content, body, and other complex 
        variables, the gastronomic qualities of beer, beer history, and 
        historical brewing traditions dating back to colonial times and earlier;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States champion the message of 
        responsible enjoyment to their customers and work within their 
        communities and the industry to prevent alcohol abuse and underage 
        drinking;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are frequently involved in local 
        communities through philanthropy, volunteerism, and sponsorship 
        opportunities, including parent-teacher associations, Junior Reserve 
        Officers' Training Corps (JROTC), hospitals for children, chambers of 
        commerce, humane societies, rescue squads, athletic teams, and disease 
        research;
Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are fully vested in the future 
        success, health, welfare, and vitality of their communities as local 
        employers who provide a diverse array of quality local jobs that will 
        not be outsourced, who contribute to the local tax base; and who keep 
        money in the United States by reinvesting in their businesses; and
Whereas increased Federal, State, and local support of craft brewing is 
        important to fostering the continued growth of an industry of the United 
        States that creates jobs, greatly benefits local economies, and brings 
        international accolades to small businesses in the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the United States Senate--
            (1) appreciates the goals of American Craft Beer Week, 
        established by the Brewers Association, which represents the 
        small craft brewers of the United States;
            (2) recognizes the significant contributions of the craft 
        brewers of the United States to the economy and to the 
        communities in which the craft brewers are located; and
            (3) commends the craft brewers of the United States for 
        providing jobs, supporting United States agriculture, improving 
        the balance of trade, and educating the people of the United 
        States and beer lovers around the world about the history and 
        culture of beer while promoting the legal and responsible 
        consumption of beer.
