_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of the month of May 2015, as 
              ``National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month''.

Whereas 500,000 families in the United States live with bladder cancer;
Whereas more than 74,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with bladder cancer 
        and 16,000 will die due to the disease in 2015 alone;
Whereas bladder cancer affects people of all ages and backgrounds and is among 
        the top 10 cancers with the highest incidence rates in the United 
        States;
Whereas bladder cancer is known as one of the most expensive cancers to treat on 
        a per patient basis with a recurrence rate of approximately 50 to 80 
        percent, requiring lifelong surveillance;
Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the urine, are easily 
        recognized, however, many are unaware of the threat of bladder cancer, 
        often prolonging the time to diagnosis;
Whereas if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is treatable;
Whereas military veterans are twice as likely as nonveterans to be diagnosed 
        with bladder cancer;
Whereas women are often diagnosed at a later stage in the development of bladder 
        cancer, and when diagnosed at the same stage as men, women have a worse 
        prognosis;
Whereas if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the life expectancy of an 
        individual with bladder cancer decreases;
Whereas the quality of life of a person with bladder cancer will depend on 
        future treatment and diagnosis developments, which will rely on research 
        advancements;
Whereas there have been no new treatments approved by the Food and Drug 
        Administration for bladder cancer in over 10 years;
Whereas research advancements for bladder cancer are limited by lack of 
        awareness about the disease within the medical community and general 
        public;
Whereas increased awareness will promote early diagnosis and increase the 
        chances of survival;
Whereas increased awareness will bolster public support of the disease and thus 
        increase funding for innovative research and the development of new 
        treatment options and diagnostic tools;
Whereas traditionally on the first Saturday in May each year, survivors, 
        caregivers, and loved ones walk together throughout the United States to 
        raise awareness of bladder cancer;
Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and its community of patients, 
        caregivers, and specialists seek--

    (1) to foster a community of hope and support;

    (2) to fund and conduct research for innovative treatments and 
diagnostic tools; and

    (3) to increase public awareness and understanding of bladder cancer; 
and

Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National Bladder 
        Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of May 2015, as ``National 
        Bladder Cancer Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Bladder 
        Cancer Awareness Month; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested 
        groups, and affected persons--
                    (A) to promote awareness of bladder cancer and to 
                foster understanding of the impact of the disease on 
                patients and their families and caregivers;
                    (B) to take an active role in the fight to end 
                bladder cancer; and
                    (C) to observe National Bladder Cancer Awareness 
                Month with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
