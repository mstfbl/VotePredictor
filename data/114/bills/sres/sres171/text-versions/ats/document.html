                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the students, parents, teachers, and administrators of 
      charter schools across the United States for making ongoing 
contributions to education, and supporting the ideals and goals of the 
16th annual National Charter Schools Week, to be held May 3 through May 
                                9, 2015.

Whereas charter schools are public schools that do not charge tuition and enroll 
        any student who wants to attend, often through a random lottery when the 
        demand for enrollment is outmatched by the supply of available charter 
        school seats;
Whereas high-performing public charter schools deliver a high-quality public 
        education and challenge all students to reach the students' potential 
        for academic success;
Whereas public charter schools promote innovation and excellence in public 
        education;
Whereas public charter schools throughout the United States provide millions of 
        families with diverse and innovative educational options for children of 
        the families;
Whereas high-performing public charter schools and charter management 
        organizations are increasing student achievement and attendance rates at 
        institutions of higher education;
Whereas public charter schools are authorized by a designated entity and--

    (1) respond to the needs of communities, families, and students in the 
United States; and

    (2) promote the principles of quality, accountability, choice, high-
performance, and innovation;

Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and autonomy, public charter schools are 
        held accountable by the authorizers of the charter schools for improving 
        student achievement and for sound financial and operational management;
Whereas public charter schools are required to meet the student achievement 
        accountability requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education 
        Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the same manner as traditional 
        public schools;
Whereas public charter schools often set higher expectations for students, 
        beyond the requirements of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools are of 
        high quality and truly accountable to the public;
Whereas 43 States and the District of Columbia have enacted laws authorizing 
        public charter schools;
Whereas, as of the 2014-2015 school year, more than 6,700 public charter schools 
        served more than 2,900,000 children;
Whereas in the United States--

    (1) in 150 school districts, more than 10 percent of public school 
students are enrolled in public charter schools; and

    (2) in 12 school districts, at least 30 percent of public school 
students are enrolled in public charter schools;

Whereas public charter schools improve the achievement of students enrolled in 
        the charter schools and collaborate with traditional public schools to 
        improve public education for all students;
Whereas public charter schools--

    (1) give parents the freedom to choose public schools;

    (2) routinely measure parental satisfaction levels; and

    (3) must prove the ongoing success of the charter schools to parents, 
policymakers, and the communities served by the charter schools or risk 
closure;

Whereas, between 2010 and 2015, research studies have found that students 
        attending public charter schools perform better academically than their 
        peers;
Whereas at least 500,000 students are on waiting lists to attend public charter 
        schools across the country before the start of the 2014-2015 school 
        year; and
Whereas the 16th annual National Charter Schools Week is scheduled to be 
        celebrated the week of May 3 through May 9, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the students, families, teachers, 
        administrators, and staff of public charter schools across the 
        United States for--
                    (A) making ongoing contributions to public 
                education;
                    (B) making impressive strides in closing the 
                academic achievement gap in schools in the United 
                States, particularly in schools with some of the most 
                disadvantaged students in both rural and urban 
                communities; and
                    (C) improving and strengthening the public school 
                system throughout the United States;
            (2) supports the ideals and goals of the 16th annual 
        National Charter Schools Week, a week-long celebration to be 
        held May 3 through May 9, 2015, in communities throughout the 
        United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to hold 
        appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities during 
        National Charter Schools Week to demonstrate support for public 
        charter schools.
