                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ``National Professional Social Work 
                                Month''.

Whereas the primary mission of the social work profession is to enhance well-
        being and help meet the basic needs of all people, especially the most 
        vulnerable in society;
Whereas social work is one of the fastest growing careers in the United States 
        with more than 640,000 members of the profession;
Whereas social workers work in all areas of our society to improve happiness, 
        health and prosperity, including in government, schools, universities, 
        social service agencies, communities, the military, and mental health 
        and health care facilities;
Whereas social workers daily embody this year's ``National Professional Social 
        Work Month'' theme, ``Forging Solutions Out of Challenges'', by helping 
        individuals, communities and the larger society tackle and solve issues 
        that confront them;
Whereas social workers have helped the Nation live up to its ideals by 
        successfully pushing for equal rights for all, including women, African 
        Americans, Latinos, people who are LGBTQ, and various ethnic, cultural, 
        and religious groups;
Whereas social workers have helped people in the Nation overcome racial strife 
        and economic and health care uncertainty by successfully advocating for 
        initiatives such as the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social 
        Security Act, unemployment insurance, workplace safety initiatives, 
        benefits under the Social Security Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
        the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act;
Whereas social workers are the largest group of mental health care providers in 
        the United States and work daily to help people overcome depression, 
        anxiety, substance abuse, and other disorders so they can lead more 
        fulfilling lives;
Whereas the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs employs more than 12,000 
        professional social workers and social workers help bolster the Nation's 
        security by providing support to active duty military personnel, 
        veterans and their families;
Whereas thousands of child, family, and school social workers across the country 
        provide assistance to protect children and improve the social and 
        psychological functioning of children and their families;
Whereas social workers help children find loving homes and create new families 
        through adoption;
Whereas social workers in schools work with families and schools to foster 
        future generations by ensuring students reach their full academic and 
        personal potential;
Whereas social workers work with older adults and their families to improve 
        their quality of life and ability to live independently as long as 
        possible and get access to high-quality mental health and health care; 
        and
Whereas social workers have helped the United States and other nations overcome 
        earthquakes, floods, wars, and other disasters by helping survivors get 
        services such as food, shelter, and health care, and mental health care 
        to address stress and anxiety: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National 
        Professional Social Work Month'';
            (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and 
        groups who promote the importance of social work and observe 
        ``National Professional Social Work Month'';
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities to promote further 
        awareness of the life-changing role that social workers play; 
        and
            (4) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the 
        hundreds of thousands of caring individuals who have chosen to 
        serve their communities through social work.
                                 <all>
