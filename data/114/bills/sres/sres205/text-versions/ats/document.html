                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Chicago Blackhawks on winning the 2015 Stanley Cup.

Whereas, on June 15, 2015, the Chicago Blackhawks Hockey Team won the Stanley 
        Cup;
Whereas the 2015 Stanley Cup title is the third Stanley Cup title for the 
        Blackhawks in 6 years;
Whereas Blackhawks fans at the ``Madhouse on Madison'' witnessed Duncan Keith 
        and Patrick Kane score show-stopping goals while goaltender Corey 
        Crawford seemed to stand on his head at times, stopping all 25 shots he 
        faced;
Whereas the Blackhawks won their sixth Stanley Cup, tying the Boston Bruins for 
        fourth on the franchise list of most titles won;
Whereas the Blackhawks joined the National Hockey League (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``NHL'') in 1926 and have a rich history in the NHL;
Whereas the Blackhawks were 1 of the 6 original teams in the NHL;
Whereas the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, and 2013;
Whereas for the first time in 77 years, the Blackhawks fans saw their heroes win 
        the Stanley Cup on home ice;
Whereas the Blackhawks began the playoffs with a double-overtime victory against 
        the Nashville Predators;
Whereas a goal scored by Brent Seabrook in triple-overtime of Game 4 helped the 
        Blackhawks defeat the Predators in 6 games;
Whereas a sweep of the Minnesota Wild followed in the second round of the 
        playoffs, setting up a showdown with the Anaheim Ducks in the Western 
        Conference Finals;
Whereas the Blackhawks earned triple and double-overtime victories against the 
        Anaheim Ducks in Games 2 and 4 on their way to winning the series in 7 
        games and clinching a berth in the Stanley Cup Finals;
Whereas the Blackhawks followed a familiar pattern in dropping Games 2 and 3 of 
        the Stanley Cup Finals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, but took a 3-2 
        series lead into Game 6 on home ice on the night of Monday, June 15, 
        2015;
Whereas in another close contest, Patrick Kane scored a goal during Game 6 that 
        marked the first time either team led by more than 1 goal in the series;
Whereas it was a great night for fans of the Blackhawks and the culmination of a 
        tremendous team effort;
Whereas Antoine Vermette, acquired at the trade deadline, scored 2 game-winning 
        goals in the Stanley Cup Finals;
Whereas Goaltender Scott Darling, when called upon in relief of Corey Crawford, 
        stood tall in net when his team needed him the most against the 
        Predators;
Whereas Duncan Keith was an ``ironman'', earning the Conn Smythe Trophy for Most 
        Valuable Player in the playoffs while logging more than 700 minutes of 
        ice time in 23 games;
Whereas Niklas Hjalmarsson blocked shots left and right and seemed to be in the 
        right place at all times;
Whereas General Manager Stan Bowman, Head Coach Joel Quenneville, President John 
        F. McDonough, and owner Rocky Wirtz have put together and led one of the 
        greatest dynasties in NHL history;
Whereas the Stanley Cup returns to the City of Chicago and gives Blackhawks fans 
        across the State of Illinois a chance to celebrate championship hockey;
Whereas the Nashville Predators, Minnesota Wild, Anaheim Ducks, and Tampa Bay 
        Lightning proved to be worthy and honorable adversaries and also deserve 
        recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Chicago Blackhawks on winning the 
        2015 Stanley Cup;
            (2) commends the fans, players, and management of the Tampa 
        Bay Lightning for an outstanding series; and
            (3) respectfully directs the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the 2015 
        Chicago Blackhawks hockey organization and Blackhawks owner 
        Rocky Wirtz.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
