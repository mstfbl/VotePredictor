                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of Alcohol Responsibility Month.

Whereas, in 2013, an estimated 10,076 people were killed in the United States in 
        drunk driving crashes involving a driver with a blood alcohol content of 
        .08 or greater, impacting countless family members, friends, and 
        communities;
Whereas, in 2013, 1 person died in a drunk driving crash every 52 minutes, on 
        average;
Whereas, in 2013, approximately 8,700,000 people of the United States between 
        the ages of 12 and 20, or nearly 23 percent of the age group for whom 
        alcohol consumption is illegal, reported consuming alcohol during the 
        preceding 30 days;
Whereas research shows that a lifetime of conversations between parents and 
        their children about alcohol, beginning at an early age, can help 
        prevent underage drinking and alcohol abuse;
Whereas the potential danger for young people to be involved in alcohol-related 
        crashes escalates during prom and graduation season;
Whereas many State attorneys general are launching underage drinking prevention 
        messages and programs in their States and communities; and
Whereas April has been dedicated to alcohol awareness for the last 28 years, and 
        more than awareness is needed to further reduce drunk driving and 
        underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) declares April to be Alcohol Responsibility Month and 
        supports the goal of encouraging responsible decision-making 
        regarding beverage alcohol;
            (2) encourages parents to be responsible role models and to 
        have ongoing conversations with their children throughout their 
        childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood about the dangers 
        of alcohol abuse;
            (3) condemns the pervasiveness of alcohol-impaired driving 
        and resulting tragedies; and
            (4) promotes the responsible consumption of alcohol by 
        adults in the United States.
