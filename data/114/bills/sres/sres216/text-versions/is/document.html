                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the month of June 2015 as ``Immigrant Heritage Month'', a 
  celebration of the accomplishments and contributions immigrants and 
  their children have made in shaping the history, strengthening the 
        economy, and enriching the culture of the United States.

Whereas the United States has always been a nation of immigrants and throughout 
        the history of the United States immigrants from around the globe and 
        their children have--

    (1) kept the workforce of the United States vibrant;

    (2) kept the businesses of the United States on the cutting edge; and

    (3) helped build the greatest economic engine in the world;

Whereas the entrepreneurial drive and spirit of the United States--

    (1) is built on the diversity of the origins of the people of the 
United States;

    (2) drew the first immigrants to the United States; and

    (3) continues to drive business in the United States;

Whereas the success of the United States is a result of the many distinct 
        experiences of the people of the United States, not in spite of those 
        distinct experiences;
Whereas, as a nation of immigrants, the people of the United States must 
        remember the generations of pioneers that helped--

    (1) lay railroads and build cities;

    (2) develop new industries; and

    (3) fuel the Information Age, from the telegraph to the smartphone;

Whereas more than 70 percent of agricultural workers in the United States are 
        foreign born, and these workers keep California and farms in the United 
        States in business and feed families in the United States;
Whereas immigrants start more than one-fourth of all new businesses in the 
        United States and immigrants or their children start more than 40 
        percent of Fortune 500 companies;
Whereas those businesses collectively employ tens of millions of people in the 
        United States and generate more than $4,500,000,000,000 in annual 
        revenue;
Whereas immigrants to the United States contribute greatly to advances in 
        technology and sciences;
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of this resolution, 14 percent of 
        employed college graduates and 50 percent of individuals with doctorate 
        degrees working in mathematics and computer science occupations in the 
        United States are immigrants;
Whereas between 2006 and 2012, 44 percent of new technology start-ups in Silicon 
        Valley (widely known as the international hub for technological 
        development and innovation) had at least 1 immigrant founder;
Whereas the work of immigrants has directly enriched the culture of the United 
        States by influencing the performing arts (from Broadway to Hollywood), 
        academia, art, music, literature, media, fashion, cuisine, customs, and 
        cultural celebrations enjoyed across the United States;
Whereas generations of immigrants have come to the shores of the United States 
        from all corners of the globe;
Whereas immigrants fought tirelessly in the Revolutionary War and continue to 
        defend the ideals of the United States;
Whereas, as of June 2015, more than 30,000 lawful permanent residents are 
        serving in the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas between 2002 and 2015, more than 102,000 men and women, including 
        individuals serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, Germany, Japan, 
        and elsewhere, have become United States citizens while wearing the 
        uniform of the United States military;
Whereas Congress represents a rich diversity of communities across the United 
        States and works closely with diaspora leaders from more than 60 ethnic 
        caucuses to ensure that the voices of people of the United States of all 
        backgrounds are heard; and
Whereas the United States was founded on the universal promise that all people 
        are created equal: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes June 2015 as ``Immigrant Heritage Month'' in 
        honor of the accomplishments and contributions of immigrants 
        and their children in shaping the history and culture of the 
        United States;
            (2) pledges to celebrate immigrant contributions to, and 
        immigrant heritage in, each State; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to 
        commemorate the history of immigrants in the United States and 
        to always remember the immigrant roots of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
