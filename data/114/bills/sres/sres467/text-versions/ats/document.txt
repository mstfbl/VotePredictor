                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week, to be observed 
                    from May 6 through May 12, 2016.

Whereas, beginning in 1991, National Nurses Week is celebrated annually from May 
        6, also known as ``National Recognition Day for Nurses'', through May 
        12, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing;
Whereas National Nurses Week is a time of year to reflect on the important 
        contributions that nurses make to provide safe, high-quality health 
        care;
Whereas nurses are known to be patient advocates, acting fearlessly to protect 
        the lives of individuals under the care of the nurses;
Whereas nurses represent the largest single component of the health care 
        profession, with an estimated population of 3,964,000 professionally 
        active nurses in the United States;
Whereas nurses are leading in the delivery of quality care in a transformed 
        health care system that improves patient outcomes and safety;
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of the Institute of Medicine has called for 
        the nursing profession to meet the call for leadership in a team-based 
        delivery model;
Whereas, when nurse staffing levels increase, the risk of patient complications 
        and lengthy hospital stays decreases, resulting in cost savings;
Whereas nurses are experienced researchers, and the work of nurses encompasses a 
        wide scope of scientific inquiry, including clinical research, health 
        systems and outcomes research, and nursing education research;
Whereas nurses provide culturally and ethnically competent care and are educated 
        to be sensitive to the regional and community customs of individuals 
        needing care;
Whereas nurses are well-positioned to provide leadership to eliminate health 
        care disparities that exist in the United States;
Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the public health infrastructure, 
        promoting healthy lifestyles and educating communities on disease 
        prevention and health promotion;
Whereas nurses are strong allies to Congress as the nurses help inform, educate, 
        and work closely with legislators to improve the education, retention, 
        recruitment, and practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the 
        health and safety of the patients for whom the nurses care;
Whereas strengthening nursing workforce development programs at all levels, 
        including the number of doctorally prepared faculty members, and 
        providing education to the nurse research scientists who can discover 
        new nursing care models to improve the health status of the diverse 
        population of the United States, are needed;
Whereas nurses touch the lives of the people of the United States from birth to 
        the end of life; and
Whereas nursing has been voted as the most honest and ethical profession in the 
        United States for each of the 13 years preceding the date of adoption of 
        this resolution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week, 
        as founded by the American Nurses Association;
            (2) recognizes the significant contributions of nurses to 
        the health care system in the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Nurses Week with appropriate recognition, ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate the importance of 
        nurses to the everyday lives of patients.
                                 <all>
