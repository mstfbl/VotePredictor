                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating June 19, 2016, as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' in 
recognition of June 19, 1865, the date on which slavery legally came to 
                      an end in the United States.

Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the frontier areas of the 
        United States, in particular the State of Texas and the other 
        Southwestern States, until months after the conclusion of the Civil War, 
        more than 2 \1/2\ years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the 
        Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863;
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, 
        arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and 
        that the enslaved were free;
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 
        19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'', as inspiration 
        and encouragement for future generations;
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest have continued the tradition of 
        observing Juneteenth Independence Day for over 150 years;
Whereas 45 States and the District of Columbia have designated Juneteenth 
        Independence Day as a special day of observance in recognition of the 
        emancipation of all slaves in the United States;
Whereas Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations have been held to honor 
        African-American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect 
        for all cultures;
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves and 
        the descendants of former slaves remain an example for all people of the 
        United States, regardless of background, religion, or race;
Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the ratification of the 13th 
        Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in December 1865; and
Whereas, over the course of its history, the United States has grown into a 
        symbol of democracy and freedom around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 19, 2016, as ``Juneteenth Independence 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth 
        Independence Day to the United States;
            (3) supports the continued nationwide celebration of 
        Juneteenth Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the 
        people of the United States to learn more about the past and to 
        better understand the experiences that have shaped the United 
        States; and
            (4) recognizes that the observance of the end of slavery is 
        part of the history and heritage of the United States.
