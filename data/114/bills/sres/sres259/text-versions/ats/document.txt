                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the bravery and heroism of those who selflessly prevented a 
   deadly terrorist attack and saved countless lives while aboard a 
   passenger train bound from Amsterdam to Paris on August 21, 2015.

Whereas, on Friday, August 21, 2015, United States Air Force Airman First Class 
        Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander 
        Skarlatos, college student Anthony Sadler, and others selflessly risked 
        their lives and forcibly subdued a gunman on a train carrying more than 
        500 passengers;
Whereas the gunman was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a handgun, a box 
        cutter, and 9 magazines carrying hundreds of rounds of ammunition and 
        could have killed and injured dozens of passengers had the gunman not 
        been stopped;
Whereas Mark Moogalian, a 51 year old French-American professor and musician, 
        courageously attempted to subdue the gunman and wrestled the Kalashnikov 
        away from the gunman, but was shot by the gunman;
Whereas United States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Oregon Army 
        National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos, college student Anthony 
        Sadler, and British consultant Chris Norman took courageous action on 
        their own initiative and forcibly subdued the gunman, rendering the 
        gunman unconscious and tying up the gunman on the floor of the train 
        with t-shirts;
Whereas United States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone suffered 
        serious injuries, including a partially severed thumb, from the gunman's 
        box cutter;
Whereas, notwithstanding his own injuries, United States Air Force Airman First 
        Class Spencer Stone treated the wounds and likely saved the life of 
        French-American Mark Moogalian;
Whereas French President Francois Hollande awarded United States Air Force 
        Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist 
        Aleksander Skarlatos, college student Anthony Sadler, and British 
        consultant Chris Norman the highest civilian honor in France, the Legion 
        of Honor, and pledged to do the same for French-American Mark Moogalian 
        and Frenchman Damien A., who also helped thwart the attack;
Whereas the United States Air Force has stated that it will nominate United 
        States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone for the Airman's 
        Medal, the highest award of the Air Force for non-combat bravery;
Whereas the United States Army has nominated Oregon Army National Guard 
        Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos for the Soldier's Medal, the highest 
        award of the Army for acts of heroism not involving actual conflict with 
        an enemy;
Whereas the Department of Defense will honor United States Air Force Airman 
        First Class Spencer Stone with the Purple Heart award and Oregon Army 
        National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos and college student 
        Anthony Sadler each with an award for courage and valor;
Whereas the city of Sacramento recognized the heroism of United States Air Force 
        Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist 
        Aleksander Skarlatos, and college student Anthony Sadler through a 
        Hometown Heroes Parade on the California Capitol Mall on September 11, 
        2015;
Whereas United States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who is 23 
        years old and a resident of California, joined the United States Air 
        Force nearly 3 years ago and serves as a medical technician stationed at 
        Lajes Air Base in the Azores;
Whereas Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos is 22 years 
        old and a resident of Oregon and had recently returned to Oregon after a 
        9 month deployment in Afghanistan;
Whereas Anthony Sadler is 23 years old, a resident of California, and is a 
        student studying kinesiology at the California State University at 
        Sacramento; and
Whereas United States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, Oregon Army 
        National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos, and college student 
        Anthony Sadler were childhood friends raised in the Sacramento area who 
        were on vacation in Europe together at the time they courageously and 
        selflessly thwarted a terrorist attack and saved countless lives: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors and commends the extraordinary bravery, courage, 
        and heroism of United States Air Force Airman First Class 
        Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander 
        Skarlatos, college student Anthony Sadler, French-American Mark 
        Moogalian, British consultant Chris Norman, and Frenchman 
        Damien A., who selflessly risked their own lives to prevent a 
        terrorist attack that could have killed dozens aboard a 
        passenger train bound for Paris; and
            (2) extends best wishes for a full recovery to all innocent 
        individuals who were injured during the attack, including 
        United States Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone and 
        French-American Mark Moogalian.
