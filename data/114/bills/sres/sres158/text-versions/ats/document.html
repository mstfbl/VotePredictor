                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the cultural and historic significance of the Cinco de Mayo 
                                holiday.

Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is celebrated each year as a 
        date of importance by Mexican and Mexican-American communities;
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, the date on which 
        Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle of Puebla, one of the many 
        battles that the Mexican people won in their long and brave fight for 
        independence, freedom, and democracy;
Whereas the victory of Mexico over France at Puebla represented a historic 
        triumph for the Mexican government during the Franco-Mexican war of 
        1861-1867 and bolstered the resistance movement;
Whereas the success of Mexico at the Battle of Puebla reinvigorated the spirits 
        of the Mexican people and provided a renewed sense of unity and 
        strength;
Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat against any of the 
        finest troops of Europe in more than half a century, sustained a 
        disastrous loss at the hands of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but 
        highly spirited and courageous, Mexican army;
Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men 
        displayed during that historic battle can never be forgotten;
Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the right of a free people 
        to self-determination, just as Benito Juarez, the president of Mexico 
        during the Battle of Puebla, once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es 
        la paz'', meaning ``respect for the rights of others is peace'';
Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters was instrumental in keeping Mexico 
        from falling under European domination while, in the United States, the 
        Union Army battled Confederate forces in the Civil War;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the foundation of the United 
        States was built by people from many countries and diverse cultures who 
        were willing to fight and die for freedom;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the close ties between the 
        people of Mexico and the people of the United States;
Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the celebration of a legacy of strong leaders 
        and a sense of vibrancy in communities; and
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder to provide more opportunity for 
        future generations: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the historic struggle of the people of 
        Mexico for independence and freedom, which Cinco de Mayo 
        commemorates; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
