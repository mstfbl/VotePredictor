                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 195th anniversary of the independence of Greece and 
         celebrating democracy in Greece and the United States.

Whereas the people of ancient Greece developed the concept of democracy, in 
        which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people;
Whereas the founding fathers of the United States, many of whom read Greek 
        political philosophy in the original Greek language, drew heavily on the 
        political experience and philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the 
        representative democracy of the United States;
Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former Commander in Chief of Greece and a 
        founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of the United 
        States in 1821, ``It is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode 
        and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be 
        thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling you.'';
Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', includes the words, 
        ``most heartily was gladdened George Washington's brave land'';
Whereas the people of the United States generously offered humanitarian 
        assistance to the people of Greece during their struggle for 
        independence;
Whereas Greece heroically resisted Axis forces at a crucial moment in World War 
        II, forcing Adolf Hitler to change his timeline and delaying the attack 
        on Russia;
Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``if there had not been the virtue and courage 
        of the Greeks, we do not know which the outcome of World War II would 
        have been'' and ``no longer will we say that Greeks fight like heroes, 
        but that heroes fight like Greeks'';
Whereas hundreds of thousands of the people of Greece were killed during World 
        War II;
Whereas Greece consistently allied with the United States in major international 
        conflicts throughout the 20th century;
Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the United States in bringing 
        political stability and economic development to the volatile Balkan 
        region, having invested billions of dollars in the countries of the 
        region and having contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid 
        for the region;
Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively participate in peacekeeping 
        and peace-building operations conducted by international organizations, 
        including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
        the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation 
        in Europe;
Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its extraordinary handling during 
        the 2004 Olympic Games of more than 14,000 athletes and more than 
        2,000,000 spectators and journalists, a feat the government and people 
        of Greece handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;
Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, 
        maintains excellent relations with Muslim countries and Israel;
Whereas European Council President Donald Tusk stated during a press conference 
        in Athens on February 16, 2016, ``The migratory crisis we are currently 
        witnessing is testing our Union to its limits. And Greece is among the 
        most affected countries. It is no coincidence that the Greek citizens on 
        the islands have been nominated to the Nobel Peace Prize for their 
        generosity in helping people in need.'';
Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps in recent years to 
        further cross-cultural understanding, rapprochement, and cooperation in 
        various fields with Turkey, and has also improved its relations with 
        other countries in the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the 
        stability of the wider region;
Whereas the governments and people of Greece and the United States are at the 
        forefront of efforts to advance freedom, democracy, peace, stability, 
        and human rights;
Whereas those efforts and similar ideals have forged a close bond between the 
        people of Greece and the United States; and
Whereas it is proper and desirable for the United States to celebrate March 25, 
        2016, Greek Independence Day, with the people of Greece and to reaffirm 
        the democratic principles from which those two great countries were 
        founded: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the 
        people of Greece as they celebrate the 195th anniversary of the 
        independence of Greece;
            (2) expresses support for the principles of democratic 
        governance to which the people of Greece are committed; and
            (3) notes the important role that Greece has played in the 
        wider European region and in the community of nations since 
        gaining its independence 195 years ago.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
