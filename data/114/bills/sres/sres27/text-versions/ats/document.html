                               RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize testimony and representation in United States of America 
                        v. Jeffrey A. Sterling.

Whereas, in the case of United States of America v. Jeffrey A. Sterling, Cr. No. 
        10-485, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern 
        District of Virginia, testimony has been requested from Julie Katzman, a 
        former employee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current or former employees of the 
        Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Julie Katzman is authorized to testify in the case 
of United States of America v. Jeffrey A. Sterling, except concerning 
matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Ms. 
Katzman in connection with the production of evidence authorized in 
section one of this resolution.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
