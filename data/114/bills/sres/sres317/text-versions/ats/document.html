  Commemorating the 20\th\ anniversary of the opening of the American 
                         Visionary Art Museum.

Whereas the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, opened on 
        November 24, 1995;
Whereas, in 1992, Congress designated the American Visionary Art Museum as the 
        national repository and education center for visionary art;
Whereas the American Visionary Art Museum--

    (1) is the first museum in North America that is wholly dedicated to 
assembling a comprehensive national collection of visionary art;

    (2) perseveres due largely to the leadership of its founder, Rebecca 
Alban Hoffberger, who built the idea of assembling a comprehensive national 
collection of visionary art into an institution;

    (3) encourages art as a means of expression for at-risk youth and other 
individuals who are often overlooked;

    (4) seeks to end the stigma associated with disability by illuminating 
the power to overcome the adversity associated with disability through 
creativity;

    (5) educates, inspires, and entertains over 125,000 visitors each year; 
and

    (6) continues to fulfill its mission to increase awareness of uncommon 
art that is created out of extraordinary circumstances; and

Whereas it is in the best interest of the national welfare and each United 
        States citizen--

    (1) to preserve visionary art; and

    (2) to celebrate visionary art as a unique art form: Now, therefore, be 
it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 20\th\ anniversary of the opening of 
        the American Visionary Art Museum; and
            (2) reaffirms that visionary art is a rare and valuable 
        national treasure to which individuals in the United States 
        should devote attention, support, and resources to ensure it is 
        collected, preserved, and understood.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
