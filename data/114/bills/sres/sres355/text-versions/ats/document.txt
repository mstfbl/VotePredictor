                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating the week beginning February 7, 2016, as ``National Tribal 
                   Colleges and Universities Week''.

Whereas there are 37 Tribal Colleges and Universities operating on more than 85 
        campuses in 16 States;
Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are tribally chartered or federally 
        chartered institutions of higher education, which creates a unique 
        relationship between Tribal Colleges and Universities and the Federal 
        Government;
Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities serve students from more than 250 
        federally recognized Indian tribes;
Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities offer students access to knowledge and 
        skills grounded in cultural traditions and values, including indigenous 
        languages, which--

    (1) enhances Indian communities; and

    (2) enriches the United States as a nation;

Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities provide access to high-quality 
        postsecondary educational opportunities for--

    (1) American Indians;

    (2) Alaska Natives; and

    (3) other individuals that live in some of the most isolated and 
economically depressed areas in the United States;

Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are accredited institutions of higher 
        education that effectively prepare students to succeed in--

    (1) the academic pursuits of the students; and

    (2) the global and highly competitive workforce;

Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities have open enrollment policies, and 
        approximately 24 percent of the students at Tribal Colleges and 
        Universities are non-Indian individuals; and
Whereas the collective mission and the considerable achievements of Tribal 
        Colleges and Universities deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning February 7, 2016, as 
        ``National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe National Tribal Colleges and Universities 
        Week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to 
        demonstrate support for Tribal Colleges and Universities.
