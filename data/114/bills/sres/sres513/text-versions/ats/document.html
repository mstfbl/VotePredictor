      Designating September 25, 2016, as ``National Lobster Day''.

Whereas the American lobster is recognized around the world as a prized and 
        flavorful culinary delicacy;
Whereas lobster fishing has served as an economic engine and family tradition in 
        the United States for centuries;
Whereas thousands of families in the United States make their livelihoods from 
        lobster fishing and processing;
Whereas more than 120,000,000 pounds of lobster is caught each year in the 
        waters of the United States, representing one of the most valuable 
        catches in the United States;
Whereas foreign markets for lobster from the United States are booming, with 
        export values having more than doubled since 2009;
Whereas historical lore notes that lobster likely joined turkey on the table at 
        the very first Thanksgiving feast in 1621;
Whereas responsible lobstering practices beginning in the 1600s have created one 
        of the most sustainable fisheries in the world;
Whereas Lobster Newburg was featured at the inaugural dinner celebration for 
        President John F. Kennedy;
Whereas lobster is an excellent source of lean protein and is low in saturated 
        fat and high in vitamin B12;
Whereas lobster has become a culinary icon, with the lobster roll featured at 
        the 2015 World Food Expo in Milan, Italy;
Whereas the White House proudly served lobster at the State Dinner with Chinese 
        President Xi Jinping on National Lobster Day in 2015;
Whereas, on September 24, 2015, steamed lobster was prepared for the visit by 
        Pope Francis to New York;
Whereas lobster is enjoyed at casual beach-side lobster boils and also revered 
        as a delicacy at fine dining restaurants; and
Whereas the peak of the lobstering season in the United States occurs in the 
        late summer: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 25, 2016, as National Lobster Day; 
        and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
