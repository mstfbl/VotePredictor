    Recognizing the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.

Whereas founders of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Carl G. Fisher, Arthur C. 
        Newby, Frank H. Wheeler, and James A. Allison pooled their resources in 
        1909 to build the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 6 miles from downtown 
        Indianapolis as a testing ground to support the growing automotive 
        industry of Indiana, paving the way for motorsport innovation;
Whereas, in 1909, the track of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was surfaced with 
        3,200,000 paving bricks at a cost of $400,000;
Whereas, on May 30, 1911, the first Indianapolis 500 Mile Race took place and 
        was won by Ray Harroun in 6 hours and 42 minutes at an average speed of 
        74.6 miles per hour;
Whereas, as of 2016, the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race has occurred on every 
        Memorial Day weekend since 1911, except during the involvement of the 
        United States in World Wars I and II from 1917 through 1918 and 1942 
        through 1945, respectively;
Whereas, in 1936, Louis Meyer, after his third win of the Indianapolis 500 Mile 
        Race, established the iconic tradition of drinking milk in the winner's 
        circle;
Whereas Tony Hulman purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1945, restoring 
        the track and restarting the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race after its 
        cancellation during World War II;
Whereas the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race is the largest single day sporting event 
        in the world, with more than 300,000 fans packing the grandstands and 
        the expansive infield of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on race day;
Whereas the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race has played an integral part in the 
        culture and heritage of the City of Indianapolis, the State of Indiana, 
        and motorsports and the automotive industry in the United States;
Whereas the Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been a showcase of speed, human 
        achievement, and the continuous pursuit of glory, and is a source of 
        great pride for all citizens of Indiana;
Whereas Tony Kanaan set the record for the fastest Indianapolis 500 Mile Race, 
        finishing it in slightly longer than 2 hours and 40 minutes at an 
        average speed of 187.4 miles per hour;
Whereas, in 2016, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and racing fans around the 
        world prepare to celebrate the greatest spectacle in racing for the 
        100th time: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 100th running of the 
Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.
