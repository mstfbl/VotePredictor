Honoring the memories and heroic actions of those killed, injured, and 
 affected by the fatal bus crash in Laplace, Louisiana, on August 28, 
                                 2016.

Whereas, on August 28, 2016, St. John the Baptist Parish firefighters and 
        Louisiana State troopers were responding to the scene of an accident 
        along I-10 Westbound in Laplace, Louisiana, when an undocumented 
        immigrant driving a passenger bus lost control of the bus and crashed 
        into a nearby vehicle;
Whereas 3 firefighters were thrown over the highway guardrail from the impact of 
        the vehicle, falling more than 30 feet into alligator-infested water;
Whereas fellow firefighters, State troopers, and at least 1 civilian quickly 
        responded to rescue the 3 overthrown firefighters;
Whereas Chief Spencer Chauvin, a 36-year-old who served the St. John the Baptist 
        Parish Fire Department for 12 years and was a beloved husband and father 
        of 2, died in the crash;
Whereas 21-year-old Jermaine Starr and 33-year-old Vontarous Kelly, both of Moss 
        Point, Mississippi, and who were passengers in the vehicle impacted by 
        the bus, were also killed in the crash;
Whereas 2 other firefighters sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital; 
        and
Whereas more than 30 additional individuals were injured: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) mourns the tragic loss of Chief Spencer Chauvin, 
        Jermaine Starr, and Vontarous Kelly;
            (2) recognizes the bravery, heroism, and dedication of the 
        firefighters, State troopers, and civilians who quickly 
        responded to attempt to save the lives of the injured;
            (3) offers sincere condolences to the families, friends, 
        and loved ones of Chief Spencer Chauvin, Jermaine Starr, and 
        Vontarous Kelly; and
            (4) expresses hope that each individual who was injured in 
        the accident makes a full and quick recovery.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
