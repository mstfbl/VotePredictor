                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work 
                                  Day.

Whereas the Take Our Daughters To Work program was created in New York City as a 
        response to research that showed that, by the 8th grade, many girls were 
        dropping out of school, had low self-esteem, and lacked confidence;
Whereas, in 2003, the name of the program was changed to ``Take Our Daughters 
        And Sons To Work'' so that boys who face many of the same challenges as 
        girls could also be involved in the program;
Whereas, in 2016, the mission of the program, to develop ``innovative strategies 
        that empower girls and boys to overcome societal barriers to reach their 
        full potential'', fully reflects the addition of boys;
Whereas the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Foundation, a nonprofit 
        organization, has grown to be one of the largest public awareness 
        campaigns, with more than 39,000,000 participants annually in more than 
        3,000,000 organizations and workplaces representing each State;
Whereas, in 2007, the Take Our Daughters To Work program transitioned to 
        Elizabeth City, North Carolina, became known as the Take Our Daughters 
        And Sons To Work Foundation, and received national recognition for its 
        dedication to future generations;
Whereas, every year, mayors, governors, and other private and public officials 
        sign proclamations and lend support to Take Our Daughters And Sons To 
        Work Day;
Whereas the fame of the Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work program has spread 
        overseas, with requests and inquiries being made from around the world 
        on how to operate the program;
Whereas 2016 marks the 23rd anniversary of the Take Our Daughters And Sons To 
        Work program;
Whereas Take Our Daughters And Sons to Work Day will be observed on Thursday, 
        April 28, 2016; and
Whereas, by offering opportunities for children to experience activities and 
        events, Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day is intended to continue 
        helping millions of girls and boys on an annual basis to examine their 
        opportunities and strive to reach their fullest potential: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the goals of introducing our daughters and 
        sons to the workplace; and
            (2) commends all participants of Take Our Daughters And 
        Sons To Work Day for the--
                    (A) ongoing contributions that the participants 
                make to education; and
                    (B) vital role that the participants play in 
                promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for 
                the United States.
                                 <all>
