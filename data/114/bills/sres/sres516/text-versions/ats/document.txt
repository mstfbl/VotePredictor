   Relative to the death of Pat Summitt, head coach emeritus of the 
            University of Tennessee women's basketball team.

Whereas coaching was the great passion of Pat Summitt's life and was an 
        opportunity for her to work with student-athletes, help student-athletes 
        discover their true potentials, and change the lives of the young women 
        she coached;
Whereas Pat Summitt won 8 National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to 
        in this preamble as the ``NCAA'') championships, received National Coach 
        of the Year honors 7 times over her career, and was recognized as the 
        Naismith Women's Collegiate Coach of the Century in 2000;
Whereas Pat Summitt won the Gold Medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics as the head 
        coach of the United States women's national basketball team;
Whereas the last team at the University of Tennessee that Pat Summitt coached 
        finished the season with an overall record of 27-9, winning a 
        Southeastern Conference Tournament Championship and earning a spot in 
        the Elite Eight in the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship 
        in Iowa;
Whereas Pat Summitt, who had more wins than any other basketball coach, male or 
        female, in NCAA history, concluded her coaching career after 38 seasons 
        at the University of Tennessee on April 18, 2012;
Whereas Pat Summitt also worked off the court, holding a graduation record of 
        100 percent for all members of the University of Tennessee women's 
        basketball team who completed their eligibility at the University of 
        Tennessee during Coach Summitt's tenure;
Whereas Pat Summitt announced on August 23, 2011, that she had been diagnosed 
        with early onset dementia, Alzheimer's type;
Whereas later in November 2011, Coach Summitt announced the Pat Summitt 
        Foundation, which helps provide funding and research for Alzheimer's 
        disease and dementia; and
Whereas, on May 29, 2012, President Barack Obama awarded the Presidential Medal 
        of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the United States, to Pat 
        Summitt for her remarkable career as an unparalleled figure in women's 
        team sports and for her courage in speaking out openly and courageously 
        about her battle with early onset dementia, Alzheimer's type: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep 
        regret the announcement of the death of Pat Summitt, head coach 
        emeritus of the University of Tennessee women's basketball 
        team; and

        communicate these resolutions to the House of Representatives 
        and transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the
