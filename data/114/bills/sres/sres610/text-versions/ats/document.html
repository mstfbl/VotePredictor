                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the first Friday in October 
                     2016 as ``Manufacturing Day''.

Whereas according to the most recent data, manufacturers contribute 
        $2,170,000,000,000 to the United States economy;
Whereas that amount has steadily risen since 2009, when manufacturers 
        contributed $1,700,000,000,000 to the United States economy;
Whereas the manufacturing sector accounts for 12 percent of the gross domestic 
        product (referred to in this preamble as ``GDP'') of the United States;
Whereas for every $1 spent in the manufacturing sector, another $1.40 is added 
        to the United States economy, the highest multiplier effect of any 
        economic sector;
Whereas the manufacturing sector supports an estimated 18,500,000 jobs in the 
        United States, approximately 1 in 6 private sector jobs in the United 
        States;
Whereas more than 12,300,000 individuals in the United States, 9 percent of the 
        workforce, are employed directly in the manufacturing sector;
Whereas, in 2014, on average manufacturing workers in the United States earned 
        more than the average worker in all other industries in the United 
        States, including pay and benefits;
Whereas manufacturers in the United States are the most productive manufacturers 
        in the world, far surpassing the worker productivity of any other major 
        manufacturing economy, leading to higher wages and living standards;
Whereas manufacturers in the United States drive innovation more than any other 
        economic sector in the United States, spending $229,900,000,000 in 2014 
        on research and development, an 82 percent increase from 5 years 
        earlier;
Whereas measured by GDP, the manufacturing sector in the United States would 
        rank as the ninth largest economy in the world; and
Whereas the first Friday in October 2016 would be an appropriate day to 
        designate as ``Manufacturing Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of the first 
Friday in October 2016 as ``Manufacturing Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
