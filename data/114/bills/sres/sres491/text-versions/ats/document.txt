                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating June 12, 2016, as a national day of racial amity and 
                            reconciliation.

Whereas the greatest asset of the United States is the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas the motto on the Great Seal of the United States is E Pluribus Unum, 
        ``out of many, one'';
Whereas the United States is comprised of multicultural, multiethnic, and 
        multiracial people;
Whereas friendship, collegiality, civility, respect, and kindness are commonly 
        shared ideals of the people of the United States; and
Whereas organizations and communities across the United States, motivated by the 
        ideals behind the motto of E Pluribus Unum, have joined together in 
        introspection and reflection on how the diversity of the people of the 
        United States has been indispensable in creating the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 12, 2016, as a national day of racial 
        amity and reconciliation;
            (2) supports all people of the United States who join in 
        activities in support of the goals and ideals of racial amity; 
        and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
