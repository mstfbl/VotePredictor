                               RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize testimony, documentary production, and representation in 
         United States of America v. Chaka Fattah, Sr., et al.

Whereas, in the case of United States of America v. Chaka Fattah, Sr., et al., 
        Cr. No. 15-346, pending in the United States District Court for the 
        Eastern District of Pennsylvania, testimony may be needed from Senator 
        Robert P. Casey, Jr., relating to his official responsibilities;
Whereas, by Rule VI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no Senator shall absent 
        himself from the service of the Senate without leave;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent Members of the Senate with respect to 
        any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their official 
        responsibilities; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., is authorized to 
testify and to produce documents in the case of United States of 
America v. Chaka Fattah, Sr., et al., except when his attendance at the 
Senate is necessary for the performance of his legislative duties, and 
except concerning matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
Senator Casey in connection with the testimony authorized in section 
one of this resolution.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
