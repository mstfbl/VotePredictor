                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the contributions of Hawaii to the culinary heritage of the 
 United States and designating the week beginning on June 12, 2016, as 
                    ``National Hawaiian Food Week''.

Whereas when individuals first came to the Hawaiian islands more than 1,500 
        years ago, there was little to eat other than birds and a few species of 
        ferns, but the individuals found rich volcanic soil, a year-round 
        growing season, and abundant fisheries;
Whereas the history of Hawaii is inextricably linked with--

    (1) foods brought to the Hawaiian islands by the first individuals who 
came to Hawaii and successive waves of voyagers to the Hawaiian islands;

    (2) the agricultural and ranching potential of the land of Hawaii; and

    (3) the readily available seafood from the ocean and coasts of Hawaii;

Whereas the food cultures initially brought to Hawaii came from places including 
        French Polynesia, China, Japan, Portugal, North Korea, South Korea, the 
        Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Samoa;
Whereas the foods first brought to Hawaii were simple, hearty fare of working 
        men and women that reminded the men and women of their distant homes;
Whereas individuals in Hawaii, in the spirit of Aloha, shared favorite dishes 
        with each other, and as a result, the individuals began to appreciate 
        new tastes and learned how to bring new ideas into their cooking;
Whereas the blend of styles in Hawaiian cooking evolves as new groups of 
        individuals make Hawaii their home;
Whereas the fusion of dishes from around the world creates a unique cuisine for 
        Hawaii that is as much a part of a visit to Hawaii as the welcoming 
        climate, friendly individuals, and beautiful beaches in Hawaii;
Whereas the food of Hawaii is appealing because it came from hard-working 
        communities of individuals that farmed, fished, or ranched for their 
        livelihoods, which are core experiences of individuals throughout the 
        United States; and
Whereas the growing appreciation for the food of Hawaii comes from hard-working 
        and ingenious farmers, fishers, educators, ranchers, chefs, and 
        businesses that innovate and export the taste of Hawaii all over the 
        world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on June 12, 2016, as 
        ``National Hawaiian Food Week''; and
            (2) recognizes the contributions of Hawaii to the culinary 
        heritage of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
