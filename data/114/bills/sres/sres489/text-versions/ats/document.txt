                               RESOLUTION


 
          Honoring the life and achievements of Muhammad Ali.

Whereas Muhammad Ali was an Olympic gold medalist;
Whereas the athletic legacy of Muhammad Ali is cemented by a 21-year 
        professional career amid a golden age of boxing, in which he amassed a 
        record of 56-5 with 37 knockouts;
Whereas Muhammad Ali was the first individual ever to capture the World 
        Heavyweight Title 3 times;
Whereas Muhammad Ali memorably recaptured the world title in the ``Rumble in the 
        Jungle'' on October 30, 1974, when he knocked out then-undefeated World 
        Heavyweight Champion George Foreman;
Whereas Muhammad Ali successfully defended his title 10 times, perhaps most 
        famously during the ``Thrilla in Manila'' on October 1, 1975;
Whereas Muhammad Ali showed, beyond his impressive fighting prowess in the 
        boxing ring, even greater courage and tenacity as an advocate outside 
        the ring;
Whereas Muhammad Ali was a great philanthropist and a widely recognized advocate 
        of peace, equality, and freedom;
Whereas Muhammad Ali remains an icon of freedom of conscience;
Whereas Muhammad Ali was a prominent African American of the Muslim faith, and 
        was and continues to be a role model to the citizens of the United 
        States of all races, ethnicities, and religions;
Whereas Muhammad Ali used his fame to advocate for humanitarian causes in 
        audiences with world leaders, such as Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama, 
        and multiple presidents of the United States; and
Whereas Muhammad Ali inspired people around the globe in displaying the same 
        vibrant and larger-than-life character and dedication in spite of his 
        physical ailments: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate honors the life of Muhammad Ali and his 
achievements as an athlete, philanthropist, and humanitarian.
                                 <all>
