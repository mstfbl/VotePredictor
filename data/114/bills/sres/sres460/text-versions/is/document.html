                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Cascade Head Preserve, an Oregon 
                             natural icon.

Whereas 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of Cascade Head Preserve, a 270-acre 
        preserve that is located north of Lincoln City, Oregon, and was 
        protected from development in 1966;
Whereas, nestled within lands managed by the United States Forest Service, 
        Cascade Head Preserve is home to many species of wildlife, plants, and 
        grassland communities that were once abundant along the Oregon coast;
Whereas the local community and volunteers helped protect Cascade Head Preserve 
        50 years ago and, along with The Nature Conservancy, have remained 
        actively engaged in its stewardship;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve, along with the adjacent segment of the Siuslaw 
        National Forest, has been recognized as a National Scenic Research Area 
        and a United Nations Biosphere Reserve for its ecological significance;
Whereas it is estimated that more than 15,000 people visit Cascade Head Preserve 
        annually, using it as a laboratory of nature to learn about grassland 
        restoration and threatened species, such as the Oregon silverspot 
        butterfly, or to enjoy recreational activities along the Pacific Ocean 
        and its coastal estuaries;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve is known for harboring rare and endemic plants, 
        including 99 percent of the known Cascade Head catchfly flower 
        population;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve has hosted teams of well-known ecologists and 
        experts from universities, zoological institutions, and Federal and 
        State agencies who have employed cutting-edge science to catch, rear in 
        captivity, and reintroduce into nature the threatened Oregon silverspot 
        butterfly;
Whereas tourism and recreation in Cascade Head Preserve have helped stimulate 
        the local economy by supporting seasonal and full-time jobs and by 
        driving economic activity along the Oregon coast; and
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve also serves as a classroom for youth from across 
        the United States who learn about the importance of restoring habitats 
        adjacent to Cascade Head Preserve, including the restoration of tidal 
        wetlands that provide a vital habitat for salmon and the recent 
        protection of 122 square miles of marine reserves along the Oregon 
        coast, which support community fisheries and local livelihoods: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of Cascade Head 
        Preserve; and
            (2) applauds the outstanding commitment of the stewards of 
        Cascade Head Preserve, naturalists, volunteers, and community 
        leaders for--
                    (A) protecting the ecological significance of 
                Cascade Head Preserve; and
                    (B) supporting the local economy through tourism 
                and recreation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
