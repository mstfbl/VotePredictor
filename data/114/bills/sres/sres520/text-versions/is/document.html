                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              July 7, 2016

 Mr. Rubio (for himself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. McConnell) submitted the 
 following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign 
                               Relations

                               RESOLUTION


 
Reaffirming the strong relationship, both in defense and trade, between 
               the United States and the United Kingdom.

Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom have a special relationship 
        grounded in the rule of law, democratic principles, a common language, 
        and a strong commitment to peace and security;
Whereas, on August 14, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister 
        Winston Churchill issued the Atlantic Charter, which defined American 
        and British war aims and laid the foundation for a post-war 
        international system founded on free trade and freedom of the seas that 
        persists to this day;
Whereas, on March 5, 1946, Winston Churchill delivered his ``Iron Curtain 
        Speech'' in Fulton, Missouri, stating, ``Neither the sure prevention of 
        war, nor the continuous rise of world organization will be gained 
        without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-
        speaking peoples . . . a special relationship between the British 
        Commonwealth and Empire and the United States'';
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom have stood side by side through 
        two World Wars, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the 
        Global War on Terror with Americans and Britons fighting and dying 
        together to defend our common interests and principles;
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom have played central roles in 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and are critical to 
        maintaining its future strength;
Whereas senior military officers from the United Kingdom have served in advisory 
        or command positions in United States headquarters, including combatant 
        commands such as CENTCOM, and officers from the United States have 
        served in similar roles in the British military;
Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom made immense contributions in 
        personnel and resources to the International Security Assistance Force 
        (ISAF), the NATO-led effort to train the Afghan National Security 
        Forces, and to assist the Afghan people in rebuilding their country;
Whereas the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty between the United States and the 
        United Kingdom, which was signed in 2007, ratified by the Senate on 
        September 29, 2010, and entered into force in April 2012, introduces 
        greater cooperation and access in order to meet the requirements of 
        mutual defense frameworks;
Whereas both nations continue a close strategic partnership in developing and 
        maintaining an effective nuclear deterrent, including developing the 
        next-generation of nuclear ballistic missile submarines and the 
        continued deployment and modernization of a submarine-launched ballistic 
        missile;
Whereas the close and expanding economic ties between the United States and the 
        United Kingdom, including the world's largest bilateral foreign direct 
        investment partnership, have greatly contributed to the continued 
        prosperity of both nations; and
Whereas, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a European Union membership 
        referendum, and the British people voted to leave the European Union: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms that the special relationship between the 
        United States and the United Kingdom will not be affected by 
        the outcome of the June 23, 2016, referendum or by changes to 
        the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union;
            (2) recognizes that continued defense and intelligence 
        cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom is 
        vital to the national security of both countries;
            (3) supports the continued political and military 
        leadership displayed by both nations in the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) since it was founded 67 years ago; 
        and
            (4) urges the President to commence discussions with the 
        Government of the United Kingdom, at their request, to ensure 
        the continuance of our current bilateral trade relationship and 
        as necessary, negotiations for the development of a free-trade 
        agreement between our two countries.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
