                  Raising awareness of modern slavery.

Whereas it is estimated that tens of millions of children, women, and men around 
        the world are subjected to conditions of modern slavery;
Whereas the International Labour Organization estimates that modern slavery 
        generates more than $150,000,000,000 in criminal profits each year;
Whereas despite being outlawed in every nation, modern slavery exists around the 
        world, including in the United States;
Whereas around the world, 55 percent of forced labor victims are women or girls, 
        and nearly 1 in 5 victims of slavery is a child; and
Whereas each year, individuals around the world join together to call for an end 
        to modern slavery by symbolically drawing a red ``X'' symbol on their 
        hands to share the message of the END IT movement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends each individual that supports the END IT 
        movement on February 25, 2016;
            (2) notes the dedication of individuals, organizations, and 
        governments to end modern slavery; and
            (3) calls for concerted, international action to bring an 
        end to modern slavery around the world.
