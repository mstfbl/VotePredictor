                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the 225th anniversary of Alexander Hamilton's seminal 
                 Report on the Subject of Manufactures.

Whereas December 5, 2016, is the 225th anniversary of Alexander Hamilton's 
        landmark Report on the Subject of Manufactures (referred to in this 
        preamble as the ``Hamilton report''), which he delivered on December 5, 
        1791;
Whereas the groundbreaking Hamilton report stressed the importance of a 
        diversified national economy in which manufacturing, alongside 
        agriculture, contributes significantly to economic health;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton promoted a modern economic vision years ahead of his 
        time based on investment, industry, internal improvements, and expanded 
        commerce;
Whereas the Hamilton report had its roots in President George Washington's first 
        annual message to Congress on January 8, 1790, when he argued that the 
        people of the United States should promote manufacturing to make the 
        United States independent of other nations for essential supplies, 
        particularly military supplies;
Whereas the House of Representatives then requested the Secretary of the 
        Treasury prepare a report describing plans to encourage 
        ``manufactories'' that would promote that independence;
Whereas the Hamilton report recognized that the Federal Government could take 
        steps to encourage innovation in the manufacturing sector, and 
        recommended government promotion of manufacturing through incentives to 
        encourage risk taking and innovation, as well as reasonable and flexible 
        tariffs to counter Great Britain's mercantilist system;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton was one of the Founding Fathers, a delegate to the 
        Constitutional Convention, a major author of the Federalist papers, a 
        signatory to the Constitution of the United States, the first Secretary 
        of the Treasury, and the founder of the First Bank of the United States 
        and the Coast Guard;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton founded the Society for the Establishment of Useful 
        Manufactures in Paterson, New Jersey, which became an important center 
        for manufacturing production and innovation;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton used his influence to define the role of the Federal 
        Government in promoting a sound financial foundation for the young 
        nation;
Whereas manufacturing is critical to the United States economy, and contributes 
        approximately $2,170,000,000,000 to the United States economy annually;
Whereas manufacturing makes an outsized contribution to the United States 
        economy in terms of total output and employment, and supports more than 
        17,000,000 indirect jobs in the United States and approximately 
        12,000,000 individuals directly employed in manufacturing, more than \1/
        5\ (21.3 percent) of total employment in the United States in 2013;
Whereas manufacturing represents more than 11 percent of the United States 
        economy, and accounts for approximately 70 percent of industry-funded 
        research and development;
Whereas manufacturing is entering a dynamic new phase, with new market 
        opportunities in the developing world, game-changing innovations in 
        materials and processes (including composites and nanomaterials, 3-D 
        printing, and advanced robotics), and increased competition across the 
        world;
Whereas manufacturing makes substantial contributions in the United States 
        economy to research and development, exports, and productivity growth;
Whereas the number of manufacturing jobs coming into the United States, through 
        reshoring and foreign direct investment, is now equal to or slightly 
        higher than the number of jobs leaving the United States, which 
        contributes to the manufacturing rebound;
Whereas manufacturing firms have a critical role in innovation, engaging new 
        technologies that improve processes, support product innovation, and 
        create well-paying jobs; and
Whereas the brand ``Made in the USA'' carries tremendous weight and appeal 
        across the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 225th anniversary of Alexander 
        Hamilton's seminal Report on the Subject of Manufactures;
            (2) recognizes the vision of Alexander Hamilton to make a 
        case for a strong and diversified economy, which has withstood 
        the test of time;
            (3) expresses admiration and appreciation for the variety 
        of ways in which Alexander Hamilton contributed to the success 
        of the young United States;
            (4) acknowledges the importance of the manufacturing 
        industry's contributions to the United States in promoting 
        innovation, job creation, and opportunity for the middle class; 
        and
            (5) supports efforts to grow and sustain United States 
        manufacturing industries by creating a healthy business climate 
        and establishing the level playing field vital to United States 
        manufacturing success.
