                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing May 2015 as ``Jewish American Heritage Month'' and honoring 
 the contributions of Jewish Americans to the United States of America.

Whereas in May of each year, people across the United States recognize and 
        celebrate over 350 years of Jewish contributions to the United States 
        through recognizing Jewish American Heritage Month;
Whereas Congress has a decades-long tradition of officially recognizing Jewish 
        American heritage;
Whereas, in the words of President Ronald Reagan, ``[a]t this time of year, it 
        is appropriate for all Americans to acknowledge how much our country has 
        benefitted from the contributions of American Jews'';
Whereas May has been designated Jewish American Heritage Month since 2006;
Whereas the United States has always been a nation built on the achievements of 
        immigrants, and Jewish Americans have strengthened the society of the 
        United States and contributed significantly to all areas of life in the 
        United States since the time when Jewish immigrants first arrived on the 
        shores of the United States;
Whereas the success of Jewish Americans is a reminder of the gift of religious 
        freedom and the importance of strong commitment to community and faith;
Whereas 2015 is the 70th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust and honoring 
        the survivors of the Holocaust and their remarkable stories is more 
        important than ever;
Whereas much work has been done in diverse cities such as New York to foster 
        transformational social change and unite people of every racial, ethnic, 
        cultural, and religious background; and
Whereas countless Jewish Americans and Jewish organizations have enriched the 
        society of the United States and shaped this great country, including--

    (1) a Czechoslovakian immigrant who survived the Holocaust as a small 
child, authored an inspiring story of her survival, A Candle in the Heart, 
and has devoted her life to telling her story to make the world a better 
place and stop hatred;

    (2) Jewish Americans who fight for justice on behalf of those least 
able to defend themselves;

    (3) Jewish Americans who are devoted to advancing civil rights for all 
people of the United States and promoting intercultural understanding;

    (4) a Bukharian Chief Rabbi who came to the United States as a young 
immigrant and worked to build the Bukharian American community from a small 
group into a vast community of over 65,000 members, many of whom immigrated 
to the United States seeking a better life free from oppression; and

    (5) Aish HaTorah International, the largest Jewish outreach 
organization of its kind in the world, which demonstrates that in the 
United States, people may freely connect with their culture and religious 
heritage and contribute to the fabric of life in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes May 2015 as Jewish American Heritage Month 
        and will celebrate Jewish American heritage on May 20, 2015; 
        and
            (2) expresses appreciation for the significant 
        contributions made by Jewish Americans to the United States of 
        America.
                                 <all>
