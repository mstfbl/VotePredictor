                               RESOLUTION


 
 Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Albert Einstein Distinguished 
      Educator Fellowship Program and recognizing the significant 
               contributions of Albert Einstein Fellows.

Whereas the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program was 
        established in 1990 and formalized by law in 1994;
Whereas Einstein Fellows are selected through a highly competitive process from 
        among the best science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
        teachers in the field and represent diverse geographic regions and 
        communities;
Whereas the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program places 
        exceptional teachers in positions within Federal agencies and on Capitol 
        Hill where they contribute to advancing the fields of education, 
        science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and public policy;
Whereas the Department of Energy, through its Office of Workforce Development 
        for Teachers & Scientists, and the Triangle Coalition for STEM Education 
        have nurtured and developed the Einstein Fellowship Program;
Whereas over 270 Einstein Fellows have served professionally at the Department 
        of Education, the Department of Energy, the National Aeronautics and 
        Space Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
        the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National 
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science 
        Foundation (NSF), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), 
        the United States Senate, and the United States House of 
        Representatives;
Whereas the Einstein Fellowship Program fosters a spirit of cooperation between 
        Federal agencies by placing a network of fellows at different agencies;
Whereas Einstein Fellows provide practical perspectives on the application and 
        impact of education policy;
Whereas Einstein Fellows have made invaluable contributions to the formulation 
        of educational policy through advice to Members of Congress and 
        officials in Federal agencies, the development of legislation, and the 
        creation of innovative educational programs and interventions;
Whereas Einstein Fellows have experienced unique opportunities for professional 
        growth and development that allow for the expansion of skills and 
        knowledge;
Whereas Einstein Fellows learn valuable leadership skills to advance the fields 
        of education, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and public 
        policy; and
Whereas Einstein Fellows, during their service and upon the continuation of 
        their professional careers, serve as role models and examples of 
        dedication and commitment for past, present, and future generations of 
        educators and public servants: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the significance of the 25th anniversary of 
        the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Program;
            (2) recognizes the value of having current science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics teachers directly 
        engaged in the policymaking process;
            (3) recognizes the sacrifices made by teachers who 
        interrupt their careers to serve as Einstein Fellows;
            (4) supports the continuation of the Einstein Fellowship 
        program;
            (5) encourages Federal agencies and congressional offices 
        to host Einstein Fellows and to leverage the expertise of 
        former Einstein Fellows; and
            (6) recognizes the contributions of past, present, and 
        future Einstein Fellows.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
