                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the Weatherization Assistance Program during its 40th 
   anniversary year for its history of reducing the energy costs of 
 families with low incomes, making low-income households healthier and 
 safer, positively impacting the environment, and supporting jobs and 
                            new technology.

Whereas Congress has long recognized the disproportionate energy burden on 
        families and individuals with low incomes;
Whereas, in 1976, Congress and the Department of Energy developed the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program (in this preamble referred to as the 
        ``WAP'') to increase the energy efficiency of dwellings owned or 
        occupied by low-income individuals, reduce the total residential energy 
        expenditures of those individuals, and improve the health and safety of 
        those individuals, especially low-income individuals who are 
        particularly vulnerable, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, 
        families with children, high residential energy users, and households 
        with high energy burdens;
Whereas low-income households on average pay 7.2 percent of the income of those 
        households on utilities, more than 3 times the amount that higher income 
        households pay;
Whereas at least \1/4\ of low-income households in many regions experience an 
        energy burden that is greater than 14 percent of household income;
Whereas nearly 9,000,000 families across the United States live in energy 
        inefficient, unhealthy homes;
Whereas the WAP operates in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, 5 
        territories of the United States, and Indian tribal governments;
Whereas more than 7,400,000 homes have been weatherized since the inception of 
        the WAP in 1976;
Whereas, in a typical year, the WAP produces more than $300,000,000 in energy 
        cost savings;
Whereas a typical low-income family saves between $250 and $450 per year after 
        receiving weatherization services;
Whereas every dollar invested in weatherization returns $4.10 to society in 
        energy, health, and safety benefits;
Whereas children in households that receive weatherization services miss fewer 
        days of school due to incidences of asthma, respiratory difficulties, 
        and other health-related issues;
Whereas investment in the WAP by the Federal Government and other sources 
        supports more than 25,000 jobs across the United States in related 
        industries;
Whereas the WAP decreases pollution and improves air quality;
Whereas the WAP has increased its impact through a strategic partnership with 
        the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (commonly known as the 
        ``LIHEAP'') of the Department of Health and Human Services;
Whereas the WAP has implemented rigorous quality control standards and 
        procedures;
Whereas the WAP has incorporated cutting edge technologies; and
Whereas, by decreasing the amount of personal income spent on home energy, the 
        WAP makes housing more affordable, improves the quality of life for 
        families with low incomes, reduces forced mobility, and increases the 
        energy security of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the Weatherization Assistance Program for 40 
        years of reducing the energy burden of families with low 
        incomes, making low-income households healthier and safer, 
        positively impacting the environment, and supporting jobs and 
        new technology;
            (2) encourages the Weatherization Assistance Program to 
        continue performing essential weatherization services in the 
        future;
            (3) applauds the dedicated professionals at the Federal, 
        State, and local levels who run the daily operations of the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program; and
            (4) congratulates the Weatherization Assistance Program on 
        the 40th anniversary of the Weatherization Assistance Program 
        being signed into law on August 14, 1976.
