        fought victory over the Quinnipiac University Bobcats of Connecticut by 
        a score of 5 to 1;
Whereas the UND men's hockey team had an incredible 2015-16 season, during which 
        Coach Brad Berry became the first head coach to win an NCAA division I 
        men's hockey national championship in an individual's first season as 
        head coach;
Whereas the UND men's hockey team won its eighth NCAA division I men's hockey 
        championship and ended the 2015-16 season with a 34-6-4 record;
Whereas Coach Brad Berry and the coaching staff have instilled character and 
        perseverance in the UND men's hockey team players and have done an 
        outstanding job coaching the UND men's hockey program;
Whereas under the leadership of Interim President Ed Schafer and Athletic 
        Director Brian Faison, academic and athletic excellence has been 
        promoted at UND;
Whereas thousands of UND fans attended the NCAA division I men's hockey 
        championship game, reflecting the tremendous fan base of UND, which 
        showcases the spirit and dedication of UND hockey fans and has helped to 
        propel the success of the UND men's hockey team; and
Whereas the UND men's hockey team's victory in the 2016 NCAA division I men's 
        hockey championship was also a victory for the entire State of North
