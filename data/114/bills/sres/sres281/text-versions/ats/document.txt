                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating the week of October 5 through October 9, 2015, as 
``National Health Information Technology Week'' to recognize the value 
  of health information technology in transforming and improving the 
         healthcare system for all people in the United States.

Whereas 2015 celebrates the 10th anniversary of National Health Information 
        Technology Week;
Whereas Congress has emphasized that the use of health information technology is 
        essential to providing coordinated care, expanding access to care, and 
        improving the quality and safety of the mental and physical health of 
        all people in the United States;
Whereas health information technology is essential for improving patient care, 
        ensuring patient safety, stopping duplicative tests and paperwork, and 
        reducing healthcare costs;
Whereas Congress has recognized that the convergence of medical advances, health 
        information technology, and high-speed broadband networks are 
        transforming the delivery of care by bringing the healthcare provider 
        and patient together virtually, especially those in disadvantaged 
        populations and geographies;
Whereas by 2020, the market segment for the healthcare-related Internet of 
        Things, which allows data to move among people, sensors, and machines, 
        is expected to approach $120,000,000,000;
Whereas personalized medicine is an important emerging healthcare topic that 
        includes the tailoring of medicines and treatments to the unique genetic 
        blueprint and lifestyle and environmental data of each patient and 
        comparing that information to the information of other individuals to 
        predict illness and determine best treatments;
Whereas Congress has recognized and taken action to modernize regulations so as 
        to grow the health information technology market, improve the health of 
        all people in the United States, create high-demand jobs, and stimulate 
        market innovation; and
Whereas it is necessary to continue activities that are foundational to the 
        transformation of healthcare delivery in the United States, including--

    (1) innovation in health information technology;

    (2) opening interoperability between systems and devices; and

    (3) the exchange of health information confidently and securely among 
different providers, systems, and insurers: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of October 5 through October 9, 
        2015, as ``National Health Information Technology Week'';
            (2) recognizes the value of information technology and 
        management systems in transforming healthcare for the people of 
        the United States;
            (3) encourages all interested parties to promote the use of 
        information technology and management systems to transform the 
        healthcare system of the United States; and
            (4) calls on all people to be engaged in their mental and 
        physical health through the use of health information 
        technology.
                                 <all>
