                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding an agreement reached at 
the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in December 
                                 2015.

Whereas, on May 9, 1992, the Senate gave the advice and consent of the Senate 
        regarding the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
        with annexes, done at New York May 9, 1992, and entered into force March 
        21, 1994 (referred to in this preamble as the ``Convention''), a treaty 
        that was intended to address the global emissions of greenhouse gases;
Whereas the Convention was ratified under the express limitation ``that a 
        decision by the Conference of the Parties to adopt targets and 
        timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and 
        consent.'';
Whereas after the Convention entered into force, parties began negotiating a 
        subsidiary agreement to contain binding greenhouse gas emissions 
        reductions, which resulted in the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations 
        Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at Kyoto on December 10, 
        1997;
Whereas the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol;
Whereas the Clinton Administration did not submit the Kyoto Protocol to the 
        Senate for the advice and consent of the Senate;
Whereas, on July 25, 1997, the Senate agreed to S. Res. 98 of the 105th Congress 
        by a vote of 95 to 0; and
Whereas the parties to the Convention operating under the Durban Platform for 
        Enhanced Action will convene in Paris in December 2015 to replace the 
        Kyoto Protocol with ``a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed 
        outcome with legal force'' aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That --
            (1) it is the sense of the Senate that any protocol, 
        amendment, extension, or other agreement relating to the United 
        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with annexes, 
        done at New York May 9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 
        1994, shall have no force or effect in the United States and no 
        funds shall be authorized in support of that protocol, 
        amendment, extension, or other agreement, including for the 
        Green Climate Fund, until that protocol, amendment, extension, 
        or other agreement has been submitted to Senate for advice and 
        consent, if that protocol, amendment, extension, or other 
        agreement--
                    (A) fulfills mitigation commitments through 
                existing and future regulations that would put our 
                national industries at a disadvantage compared to the 
                industries of developing countries;
                    (B) includes a financial commitment that will not 
                go into effect without subsequent congressional 
                legislation or authorization;
                    (C) represents an agreement to be overseen by an 
                international administrative entity covering a wide 
                range of topics, including mitigation, adaptation, 
                finance, technology transfer, capacity building, 
                transparency, implementation, and compliance; or
                    (D) establishes a mechanism to assess contributions 
                or commitments for future compliance; and
            (2) the Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President.
                                 <all>
