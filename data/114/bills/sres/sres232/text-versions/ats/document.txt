Expressing the sense of the Senate that August 30, 2015, be observed as 
  ``1890 Land-Grant Institutions Quasquicentennial Recognition Day''.

Whereas the Act of August 30, 1890 (7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.), popularly known as 
        the ``Second Morrill Act'', led to the creation of 19 historically Black 
        Federal land-grant educational institutions;
Whereas the 19 historically Black 1890 land-grant universities are identified as 
        Lincoln University, Alcorn State University, the University of Arkansas 
        at Pine Bluff, Alabama A&M University, Prairie View A&T University, 
        Southern University, Virginia State University, Kentucky State 
        University, the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore, Florida A&M 
        University, Delaware State University, North Carolina A&T University, 
        Fort Valley State University, South Carolina State University, Langston 
        University, Tennessee State University, Tuskegee University, Central 
        State University, and West Virginia State University;
Whereas the Act of May 8, 1914 (7 U.S.C. 341), popularly known as the ``Smith-
        Lever Act'', provided for the establishment of the Cooperative Extension 
        Service within the Department of Agriculture for the dissemination, 
        through Federal land-grant institutions, of information pertaining to 
        agriculture and home economics; and
Whereas appropriate recognition should be given to the contributions made by the 
        19 historically Black Federal land-grant institutions to the heritage, 
        educational development, and agricultural strength of the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) August 30, 2015, should be designated as ``1890 Land-
        Grant Institutions Quasquicentennial Recognition Day'';
            (2) such day should be observed with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities to recognize the collective contributions that 
        these institutions have made to the United States;
            (3) the Second Morrill Act and the Smith-Lever Act have 
        helped the United States develop agricultural leaders; and
            (4) the Department of Agriculture and the National 
        Institute of Food and Agriculture should remain committed to 
        supporting the goals of the Second Morrill Act and the Smith-
        Lever Act.
                                 <all>
