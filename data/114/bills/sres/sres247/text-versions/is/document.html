                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating and honoring the actions of President Harry S. Truman and 
the crews of the Enola Gay and the Bockscar in using the atomic bomb to 
                     bring World War II to an end.

Whereas, during World War II, in 1945, war in the Pacific Theater between the 
        United States and Japan had entered its fourth year;
Whereas Allied military commanders were preparing to invade Japan;
Whereas President Harry S. Truman made the tactical decision to use the newly 
        developed atomic bomb against Japan instead of invading Japan;
Whereas, on August 6, 1945, the crew of the Enola Gay, under the command of 
        Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, 
        Japan; and
Whereas, on August 9, 1945, the crew of the Bockscar, under the command of Major 
        Charles W. Sweeney, dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates and honors the courageous decision of 
        President Harry S. Truman to use atomic bombs against Japan to 
        bring an end to World War II; and
            (2) commemorates and honors the courageous actions by the 
        crews of the Enola Gay and the Bockscar in carrying out 
        missions against Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, that 
        accomplished tactical terminal objectives and saved a countless 
        number of lives of citizens of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
