                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate that ambush marketing adversely 
        affects the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams.

Whereas the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games will occur on August 5, 2016, 
        through August 21, 2016, and September 7, 2016, through September 18, 
        2016, respectively, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;
Whereas more than 10,500 athletes from 206 nations will compete in 28 Olympic 
        sports and 4,350 Paralympic athletes from 176 nations will compete in 23 
        Paralympic sports;
Whereas American athletes have spent countless days, months, and years training 
        to earn a spot on the United States Olympic or Paralympic teams;
Whereas the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et 
        seq.)--

    (1) established the United States Olympic Committee as the coordinating 
body for all Olympic and Paralympic athletic activity in the United States;

    (2) gave the United States Olympic Committee the exclusive right in the 
United States to use the words ``Olympic'', ``Olympiad'', ``Paralympic'', 
and ``Paralympiad'', the emblem of the United States Olympic Committee, and 
the symbols of the International Olympic Committee and the International 
Paralympic Committee; and

    (3) empowered the United States Olympic Committee to authorize sponsors 
that contribute to the United States Olympic or Paralympic teams to use any 
trademark, symbol, insignia, or emblem of the International Olympic 
Committee, the International Paralympic Committee, the Pan-American Sports 
Organization, or the United States Olympic Committee;

Whereas Team USA is significantly funded by 36 sponsors who ensure that the 
        United States has the best Olympic and Paralympic teams possible;
Whereas in recent years, a number of entities in the United States have engaged 
        in marketing strategies that appear to affiliate themselves with the 
        Olympic and Paralympic Games without becoming official sponsors of Team 
        USA;
Whereas any ambush marketing in violation of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1051 et 
        seq.) undermines sponsorship activities and creates consumer confusion 
        around official Olympic and Paralympic sponsors; and
Whereas ambush marketing impedes the goals of the Ted Stevens Olympic and 
        Amateur Sports Act (36 U.S.C. 220501 et seq.) to fund the United States 
        Olympic and Paralympic teams through official sponsorships: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) official sponsor support is critical to the success of 
        Team USA at all international competitions; and
            (2) ambush marketing adversely affects the United States 
        Olympic and Paralympic teams and their ability to attract and 
        retain corporate sponsorships.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
