                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week beginning on February 8, 2015, as ``National 
                Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''.

Whereas there are 37 tribal colleges and universities operating on more than 75 
        campuses in 16 States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are tribally or federally chartered 
        institutions of higher education and therefore have a unique 
        relationship with the Federal Government;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities serve students from more than 250 
        federally recognized Indian tribes;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities offer students access to knowledge and 
        skills grounded in cultural traditions and values, including indigenous 
        languages, which enhance Indian communities and enrich the United States 
        as a whole;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities provide access to high quality 
        postsecondary education opportunities for American Indians, Alaska 
        Natives, and other individuals living in some of the most isolated and 
        economically depressed areas in the United States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are accredited institutions of higher 
        education that effectively prepare students to succeed in their academic 
        pursuits and in a global and highly competitive workforce;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities have open enrollment policies, and 
        approximately 20 percent of the students at tribal colleges and 
        universities are non-Indian; and
Whereas the collective mission and considerable achievements of tribal colleges 
        and universities deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on February 8, 2015, as 
        ``National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for tribal 
        colleges and universities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
