                               RESOLUTION


 
    Congratulating the National Association of State Departments of 
        Agriculture on the celebration of its 100th anniversary.

Whereas the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (referred 
        to in this preamble as ``NASDA'') was established in 1916 to provide a 
        cohesive, science-based voice for State perspectives in discussions on 
        national agriculture policy issues;
Whereas the first meeting of NASDA was held on May 4, 1916, in the hearing room 
        of the Committee on Court of Claims of the Senate;
Whereas since 1916, NASDA has provided exemplary nonpartisan representation of 
        the departments of agriculture in all 50 States and 4 United States 
        territories in order to promote sound public policy and programs in 
        support of United States agriculture;
Whereas NASDA has become a national leader in growing and enhancing agriculture 
        through the forging of partnerships to achieve sound policy outcomes 
        among State departments of agriculture, the Federal Government, and 
        stakeholders;
Whereas NASDA has successfully amplified the voices of all State departments of 
        agriculture by achieving consensus on a breadth of issues, including 
        food safety, agriculture labor, international trade, and the 
        environment; and
Whereas 1 century later, NASDA continues its deep commitment to promoting the 
        interests of the farmers and ranchers of the United States, both 
        domestically and worldwide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the National Association of 
State Departments of Agriculture on the celebration of the 100th 
anniversary of its founding.
                                 <all>
