Congratulating the Pittsburgh Penguins for winning the 2016 Stanley Cup 
                          hockey championship.

Whereas on June 12, 2016, the Pittsburgh Penguins won the 2016 Stanley Cup 
        hockey championship;
Whereas the Penguins, in their 49th year playing in the National Hockey League 
        (NHL), won their fourth Stanley Cup;
Whereas the Penguins defeated the Western Conference Champion San Jose Sharks in 
        the Stanley Cup Finals, clinching the series with 4 wins and 2 losses;
Whereas the Penguins endured 3 tough opponents en route to the championship, 
        defeating the New York Rangers, the Washington Capitals, and the Tampa 
        Bay Lightning to clinch the Eastern Conference title and win their fifth 
        Prince of Wales Trophy;
Whereas the city of Pittsburgh is fittingly nicknamed ``The City of Champions'', 
        highlighting the success of Pittsburgh professional sports teams, which 
        have tallied 15 championships;
Whereas the Penguins have an active sellout streak of 431 games, illustrating 
        the love of the fans for the Penguins team and players;
Whereas Mike Sullivan took over as Penguins head coach on December 12, 2015, 
        turning around the Penguins season and leading the team to a second-
        place finish in the Metropolitan Division and a spot in the playoffs;
Whereas NHL Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle have jointly owned the 
        team for 17 years, saving the Penguins from relocation and maintaining 
        the team for the city of Pittsburgh;
Whereas Penguins General Manager Jim Rutherford made several critical trades to 
        acquire talented players that fit perfectly into the Penguins upbeat 
        style of play, including forwards Phil Kessel, Carl Hagelin, and Nick 
        Bonino, who form the trio affectionately known as the ``HBK'' line;
Whereas longtime Penguins radio announcer Mike Lange is beloved by loyal fans of 
        the team for such expressions as ``Lord Stanley, Lord Stanley, get me 
        the brandy'';
Whereas Penguins Captain Sidney Crosby, who has shown immense leadership, 
        commitment to the team, and unparalleled skill throughout his 
        outstanding career, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the 2016 NHL 
        Playoffs Most Valuable Player;
Whereas goaltender Matt Murray dazzled throughout the playoffs, maintaining his 
        unbelievably cool composure as a rookie on the biggest stage of hockey 
        while compiling a 15-6 record, a 2.08 goals-against average, and a 0.923 
        save percentage; and
Whereas the entire Penguins roster contributed to the Stanley Cup victory, 
        including Matt Cullen, Pascal Dupuis, Eric Fehr, Patric Hornqvist, Tom 
        Kuhnhackl, Chris Kunitz, Evgeni Malkin, Bryan Rust, Conor Sheary, Oskar 
        Sundqvist, Ian Cole, Trevor Daley, Brian Dumoulin, Justin Schultz, Kris 
        Letang, Ben Lovejoy, Olli Maatta, Derrick Pouliot, Marc-Andre Fleury, 
        and Jeff Zatkoff: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Pittsburgh Penguins and the loyal 
        fans of the Penguins for becoming the 2016 NHL Stanley Cup 
        champions; and
            (2) respectfully directs the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the co-owners of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Mario 
                Lemieux and Ron Burkle;
                    (B) the President of the Pittsburgh Penguins, David 
                Morehouse; and
                    (C) the Head Coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Mike 
                Sullivan.
