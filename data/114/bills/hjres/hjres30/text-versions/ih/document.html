                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           February 10, 2015

    Ms. Lee (for herself, Mr. Honda, Mr. Ellison, Mr. Grijalva, Mr. 
 Grayson, Mr. Conyers, and Mr. Nadler) introduced the following joint 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and 
  in addition to the Committee on Armed Services, for a period to be 
subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration 
  of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee 
                               concerned

                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
 To require a strategy and report to counter the Islamic State in Iraq 
                and the Levant, and for other purposes.

Whereas the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is a violent extremist 
        organization that constitutes a significant regional threat and should 
        be degraded and dismantled;
Whereas the political environment in Iraq has grown increasingly polarized over 
        the last few years, exacerbating sectarian tensions and giving rise to 
        unprecedented numbers of ethnic militias while the conflict in 
        neighboring Syria has continued unabated resulting in more than 3 
        million refugees fleeing the country and at least 190,000 civilians 
        killed;
Whereas, on September 10, 2014, President Obama stated that the United States 
        ``cannot do for Iraqis what they must do themselves, nor can we take the 
        place of Arab partners in securing the region'';
Whereas President Obama has stated repeatedly that there is no military solution 
        to the current crisis in Iraq and Syria;
Whereas, on May 25, 2013, President Obama called on Congress to ``refine, and 
        ultimately repeal'' the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public 
        Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note);
Whereas, on July 25, 2014, the Obama Administration called on Congress to repeal 
        the outdated Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
        Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), stating 
        that ``the Iraq AUMF is no longer used to for any U.S. government 
        activities and the Administration fully supports its repeal'';
Whereas, any authorization for the use of military force related to military 
        operations against ISIL should explicitly state that the Authorization 
        for the Use of Military Force and the Authorization for Use of Military 
        Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 do not authorize the use of force 
        against ISIL; and
Whereas Congress has a constitutional obligation to debate and authorize any use 
        of military force taken in Iraq and Syria pursuant to Operation Inherent 
        Resolve or other efforts undertaken to degrade and dismantle ISIL: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Solution 
to ISIL Resolution''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) pursue a comprehensive diplomatic, political, economic, 
        and regionally led strategy to degrade and dismantle the 
        Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL);
            (2) work through the United Nations and with allies and 
        regional partners, including the Arab League, to pursue a 
        political and diplomatic solution to degrade and dismantle 
        ISIL;
            (3) work through the United Nations and with allies and 
        regional partners, including the Arab League, to address the 
        legitimate political grievances of all ethnic and religious 
        groups in Iraq and Syria and to protect vulnerable groups from 
        violence from ISIL;
            (4) implement to the fullest extent United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 2170 (2014), calling on Member States to act 
        to suppress the flow of foreign fighters, financing, and other 
        support to ISIL;
            (5) implement to the fullest extent United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 2178 (2014), condemning violent extremism 
        and calling on Member States to prevent the ``recruiting, 
        organizing, transporting or equipping of individuals who travel 
        to a State other than their States or residence or nationality 
        for the purpose of the perpetration, planning of, or 
        participation in terrorists acts'';
            (6) ensure that any foreign assistance provided to Iraqi 
        security and Syrian opposition forces be subject to stringent 
        human rights vetting, including, at a minimum, section 620M of 
        the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2378d) and other 
        applicable human rights vetting laws; and
            (7) strongly support regionally led efforts to counter the 
        threat of ISIL.
