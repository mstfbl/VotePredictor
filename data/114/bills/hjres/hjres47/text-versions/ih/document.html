     Supporting the establishment of a Presidential Youth Council.

Whereas the unique perspectives and insights of young people, especially young 
        people who have previously participated in a public policy-related 
        program, outreach initiative, internship, or fellowship opportunity, are 
        essential to ensure that investments made by the Federal Government in 
        youth services are effective and efficient;
Whereas existing outreach and engagement mechanisms of the Federal Government 
        are designed in ways that inhibit the participation, and lead to the 
        underrepresentation, of young people in the policymaking process; and
Whereas numerous Members of Congress, Governors, State legislatures, mayors, and 
        city councils have created youth councils that have proven to be an 
        effective means of receiving input from young people, which leads to 
        more effective and efficient policies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PRESIDENTIAL YOUTH COUNCIL.

    (a) Congress--
            (1) supports the establishment with private funds of a 
        Presidential Youth Council to--
                    (A) advise the President and the administration on 
                the perspectives of young people;
                    (B) make public policy-related youth programs more 
                efficient and effective; and
                    (C) address issues that will affect the long-term 
                future of the United States;
            (2) recommends that the Presidential Youth Council be 
        composed of 24 young people who--
                    (A) are appointed by leaders of the majority and 
                minority parties in the House and the Senate, and the 
                President, in the manner described in subsection (b);
                    (B) are 16 to 24 years of age;
                    (C) have participated in a public policy-related 
                program, outreach initiative, internship, fellowship, 
                or congressionally sponsored youth advisory council;
                    (D) can constructively contribute to policy 
                deliberations;
                    (E) can conduct outreach to solicit the views and 
                perspectives of peers; and
                    (F) have backgrounds that reflect the racial, 
                socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United 
                States; and
            (3) recommends that the Presidential Youth Council as a 
        whole undertake activities to solicit the unique views and 
        perspectives of young people and bring those views and 
        perspectives to the attention of the head of each department or 
        agency of the Federal Government and Congress.
    (b) Congress recommends that the members of the Presidential Youth 
Council be appointed in the following manner:
            (1) The President shall appoint 4 Council members.
            (2) The Speaker of the House shall appoint either 4 Council 
        members (if the Speaker belongs to the same political party as

        belong to the same political party as the President).
            (3) The Minority Leader of the House shall appoint either 4 
        Council members (if the Minority Leader belongs to the same

        the President).
            (5) The Minority Leader of the Senate shall appoint either 
        4 Council members (if the Minority Leader belongs to the same 
        political party as the President) or 6 Council members (if the

        the President).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
