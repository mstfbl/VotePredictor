                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             April 20, 2016

 Mr. Ted Lieu of California (for himself and Mr. Yoho) introduced the 
  following joint resolution; which was referred to the Committee on 
                            Foreign Affairs

                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
    To provide limitations on the transfer of certain United States 
           munitions from the United States to Saudi Arabia.

Whereas the enduring security partnership between the United States Government 
        and the Government of Saudi Arabia has historically served to preserve 
        the stability of the Arabian Gulf region;
Whereas the United States Government appreciates the Government of Saudi 
        Arabia's participation in the global counter-ISIL coalition;
Whereas the United States Armed Forces provide dedicated personnel and assets to 
        the armed forces of Saudi Arabia to support their military operations in 
        Yemen, including over 700 air-to-air refueling sorties, and to assist 
        with effectiveness and reduction of collateral damage;
Whereas the Department of State has consistently urged all sides of the conflict 
        in Yemen to take all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to 
        civilians and to comply with their obligations under international 
        humanitarian law, which includes minimizing harm to civilians and 
        differentiating between civilian infrastructure and military objectives;
Whereas the Panel of Experts established pursuant to United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 2140 (2014) reported on January 22, 2016, that the 
        military coalition led by the Government of Saudi Arabia in Yemen ``had 
        conducted air strikes targeting civilians and civilian objects, in 
        violation of International Humanitarian Law, including camps for 
        internally displaced persons and refugees; civilian gatherings, 
        including weddings; civilian vehicles, residential areas, medical 
        facilities schools, mosques, markets, factories and food storage 
        warehouses and other essential civilian infrastructure such as the 
        airport in Sanaa, the port in Hudayadah, and domestic transit routes'';
Whereas the Panel of Experts reported on January 22, 2016, that Houthi-Saleh 
        forces in Aden and Ta'izz had ``attacked civilians and civilian objects, 
        including by shelling civilian residential areas, medical facilities, 
        schools and other civilian infrastructure and using snipers positioned 
        atop buildings to target people seeking safety, medical care or food'';
Whereas in the course of the conflict in Yemen, the systematic and widespread 
        blockade of commercial goods has directly contributed to the obstruction 
        of deliveries of aid and humanitarian assistance, while restricting 
        vital imports of commercial fuel, food, and other goods;
Whereas, since 2010, the President has submitted for review sales to Saudi 
        Arabia of defense articles and services with a potential value of more 
        than $100,000,000,000, including a $1,300,000,000 sale of precision 
        guided air-to-ground munitions that was notified to Congress on November 
        13, 2015; and
Whereas designated foreign terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda in the 
        Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which 
        pose a grave threat to the national security of the United States, have 
        significantly expanded the territory under their control in Yemen since 
        the Government of Saudi Arabia began military operations in Yemen on 
        March 26, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that no transfer to Saudi Arabia of

        threat our nations face from designated foreign terrorist 
        organizations; and
            (2) takes all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of 
        harm to civilians and civilian objects, in compliance with 
        international humanitarian law, in the course of military 
        actions it pursues for the purpose of legitimate self-defense 
        as described in section 4 of the Arms Export Control Act (22
