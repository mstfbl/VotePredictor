                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize the use of the Armed Forces of the United States against 
Iran if the President determines and certifies to Congress that Iran is 
not able to demonstrate that it has not sought, developed, or acquired 
 nuclear weapons in violation of its commitments or obligations under 
    the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and for other purposes.

Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was agreed to on July 14, 
        2015, and states that ``The full implementation of this JCPOA will 
        ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.'' 
        and that ``Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever 
        seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

Enforcement Resolution''.

Action.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States

        statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of 
        the War Powers Resolution.
            (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this

        Resolution.

Action'' means the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed at Vienna 
July 14, 2015, by Iran and by the People's Republic of China, France,
