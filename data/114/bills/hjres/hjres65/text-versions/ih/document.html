                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
 To authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces to achieve the 
        goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization of Use of 
Force Against Iran Resolution''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On July 14, 2015, a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
        designed to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is used solely 
        for peaceful purposes was finalized.
            (2) Pursuant to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 
        2015, signed into law on May 22, 2015, the United States 
        Congress is tasked with reviewing this plan of action to make 
        certain the terms of the agreement will unequivocally prevent 
        Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.
            (3) The United States must do all that is necessary to 
        ensure that all of Iran's pathways to obtaining a nuclear 
        weapon are blocked.
            (4) Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon has and will 
        continue to destabilize the region.
            (5) Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon is a threat not only 
        to the United States but also to our allies in the region.
            (6) Iran's sincerity in forgoing the procurement of a 
        nuclear weapon has created legitimate cause for concern.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO ACHIEVE 
              THE GOAL OF PREVENTING IRAN FROM OBTAINING NUCLEAR 
              WEAPONS.

    (a) In General.--The President is authorized to use the Armed 
Forces of the United States as the President determines necessary and 
appropriate in order to achieve the goal of preventing Iran from 
obtaining nuclear weapons.
    (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--
            (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with 
        section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress 
        declares that this section is intended to constitute specific 
        statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of 
        the War Powers Resolution.
            (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this 
        joint resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers 
        Resolution.

SEC. 4. REPORT.

    Not later than 60 days after the date on which the President 
exercises the authority described in section 3, and every 60 days 
thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a report on the 
specific actions taken pursuant to such authority.
