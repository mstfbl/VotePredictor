                               RESOLUTION


 
   Honoring and praising the American Jewish Committee (AJC) on the 
                   occasion of its 109th anniversary.

Whereas the American Jewish Committee (AJC) was founded on November 11, 1906, in 
        New York City by a group of American Jews who wanted to raise awareness 
        about pogroms (violent riots) targeting Jews in Russia;
Whereas its mission statement is ``To enhance the well-being of the Jewish 
        people and Israel, and to advance Jewish rights and Jewish values in the 
        United States and around the world'';
Whereas AJC recognizes that a violation of the rights of one group threatens the 
        equality and justice of all;
Whereas AJC's groundbreaking research on prejudice and racism was cited in the 
        historic Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education;
Whereas AJC, an early supporter of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the 
        Voting Rights Act of 1965, has not wavered in its dedication to the 
        civil rights struggle in the United States, as it remains committed to 
        safeguarding human rights abroad;
Whereas AJC has a long history of advocating and working as a coalition-builder 
        for comprehensive immigration reform;
Whereas AJC's activism and awareness campaign on the horrors and lessons of the 
        Holocaust contributed greatly to the inclusion of human rights 
        provisions in the United Nations Charter;
Whereas AJC, in partnership with the Jewish community and other civil society 
        leaders, has been an essential resource and advocate in the fight 
        against rising global anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry;
Whereas AJC has been a tireless defender of Israel, becoming the first American 
        Jewish Organization to open an office in Israel, and an early and 
        effective advocate of Israel's acceptance into the global community; and
Whereas AJC has worked to spread freedom and liberty all over the world: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 109th anniversary of the historic 
        founding of the American Jewish Committee; and
            (2) honors and praises the American Jewish Committee on the 
        occasion of its anniversary for its efforts regarding human 
        rights worldwide, interfaith dialogue, and the defense of 
        Israel's right to exist as a Jewish State.
                                 <all>
