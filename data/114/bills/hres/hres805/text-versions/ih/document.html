                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of ``National Latino AIDS Awareness 
           Day'' on October 15, 2016, and for other purposes.

Whereas Hispanics and Latinos are the Nation's largest and fastest growing 
        ethnic minority group in the United States and according to the Census 
        Bureau (2013) the Latino population in 2013 was 53,000,000, making up 17 
        percent of the United States population;
Whereas in 2013, Latinos represented 17 percent of the United States population 
        and accounted for 23 percent of HIV infections among adults and 
        adolescents;
Whereas in 2013, the rate of HIV infections for Latino males was 3 times greater 
        than non-Hispanic White males and almost 4 times greater for Latino 
        females than non-Hispanic White females;
Whereas in 2010, Latinas accounted for nearly 1 in 5 deaths or 18 percent 
        (3,513) among people with an HIV diagnosis;
Whereas in 2010, Latinas accounted for 15 percent (1,400) of new HIV infections, 
        and their HIV incidence rate was more than 4 times the rate for White 
        women;
Whereas in 2011, 63 percent of Latinos ages 18 and older had never been tested 
        for HIV;
Whereas among those who are HIV positive, the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC) reports that 36 percent of Latinos were tested for HIV 
        late in their illness, by comparison 31 percent of Blacks and 32 percent 
        of Whites were tested late;
Whereas a number of challenges contribute to the epidemic in Latino communities, 
        including poverty, injection drug use, homophobia stigma and 
        discrimination, limited access to health care, and language or cultural 
        barriers in health care settings; and
Whereas more than 125,051 Latinos with an AIDS diagnosis have died since the 
        epidemic began, including 2,370 in 2010: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Latino AIDS 
        Awareness Day'';
            (2) salutes more than 165,159 Latino AIDS survivors in the 
        United States and the efforts of individuals living with HIV/
        AIDS, volunteers, and professionals who combat AIDS each day;
            (3) encourages State and local governments, including 
        public health agencies and media organizations, to recognize 
        and support ``National Latino AIDS Awareness Day'', publicize 
        its importance among communities, and encourage individuals, 
        especially Latinos, to get tested for HIV;
            (4) commends the work of AIDS service organizations and 
        community and faith-based organizations that are providing 
        effective, evidence-based prevention, treatment, care, and 
        support services to people living with and vulnerable to HIV/
        AIDS;
            (5) supports the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS 
        Strategy and its goals to reduce new HIV infections, increase 
        access to care and improve health outcomes for people living 
        with HIV, reduce HIV-related disparities and health inequities, 
        and achieve a more coordinated national response to the HIV/
        AIDS epidemic;
            (6) supports effective and comprehensive HIV prevention 
        education programs to promote the early identification of HIV 
        through voluntary routine testing, and to connect those in need 
        to clinically and culturally appropriate care and treatment;
            (7) supports appropriate funding of HIV/AIDS prevention, 
        care, treatment, research, and housing, including community-
        based approaches to fight stigma, discrimination, and 
        homophobia; and
            (8) encourages a comprehensive prevention and treatment 
        strategy that empowers public health workers, educators, faith 
        leaders, community-based organizations, and other stakeholders 
        to engage their communities to help decrease violence, 
        discrimination, and stigma towards individuals who disclose 
        their sexual orientation or HIV status, and normalize voluntary 
        testing practices.
