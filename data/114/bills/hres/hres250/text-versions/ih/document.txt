                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress 
 should pass no law that would exempt from its obligations or provide 
    any other special consideration to elected or appointed Federal 
                officials or any other Federal employee.

Whereas America was founded upon the principle that a free people should be 
        self-governed by fellow citizens elected to be their representatives, 
        and not governed by a ruling class or subject to rule by elites;
Whereas America was also founded on the principle that no person, whatever his 
        or her position within government, is unbound by the laws of this great 
        Nation and the public trust;
Whereas these great principles were enshrined in the Nation's founding documents 
        for all future generations by the signers of the Declaration of 
        Independence and the framers of the United States Constitution;
Whereas the American people have continually called for more accountability from 
        a Federal Government they view as out of touch and out of control;
Whereas rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Government from 
        Washington, DC, continually play a larger role in Americans day-to-day 
        lives;
Whereas there is a growing perception in America that elected officials and 
        unaccountable bureaucrats in the Nation's capital pass policies that 
        place burdens on hardworking Americans with impunity, knowing they will 
        never have to bear their costs;
Whereas Americans who work hard, follow the law, and only ask that no person or 
        group be given preferential treatment under our Nation's laws expect 
        Federal representatives and a Government that share those values: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should pass no law that would exempt from its obligations, 
excuse from its criminal or civil penalties, or provide any other 
special consideration to Members of the House of Representatives, 
Members of the Senate, Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, the 
President, Vice President, appointees of the Executive, or any Federal 
employee.
