                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Ottawa University in Ottawa, 
                                Kansas.

Whereas the Ottawa Indians were aboriginal inhabitants of lands in the Great 
        Lakes area of the United States;
Whereas the Ottawa were victims of the Federal Government's Removal Policy of 
        the 1830s, losing all of the aboriginal lands, fragmenting their 
        population, and resulting in a band of Ottawa moving to Kansas;
Whereas the Ottawa established a new community in Kansas and made positive 
        contributions to the settlement of Kansas, including their offering of 
        lands for what became Ottawa University;
Whereas Ottawa University traces its roots to a strong partnership between 
        Baptist missionaries and the Ottawa Indian tribe that began prior to 
        Kansas' statehood;
Whereas, in 1837, the Reverend Jotham Meeker, his wife, Eleanor Richardson 
        Meeker, and their children moved to the banks of the Marais des Cygnes 
        River to devote themselves to serving as ministers, physicians, 
        teachers, and counselors to the Ottawa Indian tribespeople who had 
        recently been moved to the area;
Whereas Reverend Meeker inspired others, including John Tecumseh ``Tauy'' Jones 
        to take up this work of building a vibrant partnership with the tribal 
        leaders;
Whereas this partnership between the Kansas Baptist denomination and the Ottawa 
        Indian Tribe, under Tauy Jones' leadership, led to the foundation, in 
        1865, of a school dedicated to the benefit of the children of the Ottawa 
        people, placed on 20,000 acres of land offered by the Tribe to support 
        the establishment of the institution;
Whereas the original charter was to form a boarding school for tribal children 
        and both parties quickly recognized the importance of offering a 
        college-level education and the appreciation by members of the Tribe, 
        the Baptists, and the people of Ottawa that a college would serve as an 
        economic growth engine for the emerging community around the Marais des 
        Cygnes River;
Whereas Ottawa University's Christian heritage and respectful partnership with 
        the Ottawa Indians remains alive and powerful today, evidenced by the 
        2008 agreement between Kevin Eichner, President of the University, and 
        Chief John Ballard of the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma to grant, in 
        perpetuity, free tuition and room and board to all certified tribal 
        members who wish to attend either the residential college in Ottawa, 
        Kansas, or any of Ottawa University's adult on-ground or online 
        programs. This agreement has been widely embraced and celebrated by 
        faculty, alumni, board members, and friends of the University and by 
        tribal members as emblematic of the institution's core mission and 
        principles and its enduring commitment to serve the mutual purposes of 
        its founders;
Whereas, throughout its history, Ottawa University has pursued an innovative 
        approach to higher education's role in society. In the 1970s, Ottawa was 
        one of the first to embrace a growing demand for programs specifically 
        tailored to the needs of adult students, opening an adult campus in 
        Kansas City in 1974, in Phoenix in 1977, in Brookfield, Wisconsin, in 
        1992, in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in 2002, and in Chandler, Arizona, in 
        2009. The university also began offering degree programs exclusively 
        online in 2008;
Whereas Ottawa University's mission is to provide the highest quality liberal 
        arts and professional education in a caring, faith-centered community of 
        grace, which integrates learning and life;
Whereas Ottawa University serves more than 4,800 students from 49 states and 16 
        countries;
Whereas Ottawa University employs more than 200 Kansans as faculty and staff who 
        are equally committed to ensuring that each and every student receives 
        personal attention and the highest quality education that honors the 
        school's mission and history;
Whereas there are more than 23,000 distinguished graduates of Ottawa University 
        serving their communities, professions, and churches around the world;
Whereas Ottawa University has grown from a single building to a comprehensive, 
        global institution of higher learning dedicated to an aspiration to 
        serve as a beacon for educating students for lifetimes of enlightened 
        faith, exemplary service, inspired leadership, and personal growth and 
        significance; and
Whereas Ottawa University's commitment to education exemplifies the best of 
        Kansas' past, present, and future and serves as an inspiration to all 
        Kansans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives commends and celebrates 
the 150th Anniversary of Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas as it 
inspires its students to lead with competence and character.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
