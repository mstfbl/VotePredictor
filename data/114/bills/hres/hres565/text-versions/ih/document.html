                               RESOLUTION


 
               Supporting the peace process in Colombia.

Whereas the Republic of Colombia is one of the United States strongest allies in 
        the Western Hemisphere;
Whereas the peoples of the United States and Colombia share a history of 
        friendship and a common commitment to peace and democratic values;
Whereas peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the 
        Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are advancing, affording 
        an opportunity to end the most enduring conflict in our hemisphere;
Whereas according to Colombia's National Center of Historical Memory, over 
        6,000,000 people have been internally displaced and more than 220,000 
        killed over the course of the conflict, 80 percent of them civilians;
Whereas Colombians of all walks of life have suffered as a result of the 
        violence, which has included massacres, kidnappings, assassinations, 
        sexual violence, extrajudicial executions, use of landmines, recruitment 
        of child soldiers, forced disappearances, and forced displacement;
Whereas minority groups, including the Afro-Colombian, indigenous and rural 
        communities, as well as women, have been disproportionately harmed by 
        the conflict; and
Whereas successfully negotiating an end to the Colombian conflict will 
        positively contribute to regional stability and promote United States 
        policy goals in the Western Hemisphere by strengthening the rule of law, 
        democracy, and human rights in Colombia: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of the ongoing negotiations 
        between the Colombian government and the FARC;
            (2) commends Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, who 
        has demonstrated vision and leadership in effectively seeking a 
        negotiated settlement to end the conflict and lay the 
        foundations for a sustainable peace;
            (3) calls on the negotiating parties to fully address the 
        just demands of victims of violence for truth, justice, 
        meaningful reparations and guarantees that the violence of the 
        past will not be repeated; and
            (4) urges President Barack Obama and his Administration to 
        continue to vigorously support these negotiations and to 
        develop plans to support the Colombian people in building a 
        just and lasting peace.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
