                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of May 30 as ``National Bartter 
                            Syndrome Day''.

Whereas bartter syndrome is a rare kidney condition that causes an imbalance of 
        potassium, sodium, chloride, and other molecules in the body;
Whereas the antenatal form of bartter syndrome, which begins before birth, is 
        often life-threatening and is characterized by abnormally high levels of 
        amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus, premature delivery, and 
        salt loss;
Whereas the classical form of bartter syndrome, which begins in early childhood 
        and tends to be less severe, causes individuals to experience fatigue, 
        muscle weakness, growth delay, and developmental delay;
Whereas bartter syndrome likely affects approximately one per million people 
        worldwide, although the exact prevalence is unknown;
Whereas increased awareness and research of the bartter syndrome will promote 
        accurate and early recognition of the disorder and help families with 
        children suffering from this condition cope with the associated 
        difficulties; and
Whereas May 30 would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National Bartter 
        Syndrome Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Bartter Syndrome Day''.
