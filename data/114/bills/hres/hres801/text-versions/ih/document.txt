        results in loss of memory and other cognitive function and, eventually, 
        death;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United 
        States and the fifth leading cause of death for persons aged 65 and 
        over;
Whereas an estimated 5,400,000 people in the United States are living with 
        Alzheimer's disease, and this number may increase to 16,000,000 by the 
        year 2050;
Whereas someone in the United States develops Alzheimer's disease every 66 
        seconds;
Whereas nearly two-thirds of those living with Alzheimer's disease, a total of 
        3,300,000 people, are women;
Whereas it is estimated that 700,000 people will die with Alzheimer's disease in 
        2016;
Whereas deaths from Alzheimer's disease increased 71 percent between 2000 and 
        2013, while deaths from other major diseases, including heart disease, 
        stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and HIV/AIDS, decreased during 
        the same period;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 causes 
        of death in the United States that has no means of prevention, no cure, 
        and no method for slowing its progression;
Whereas the direct costs to United States society of caring for Alzheimer's 
        patients in 2016 is estimated to be $236,000,000,000, including 
        $160,000,000,000 that will be spent by Medicare and Medicaid;
Whereas more than 15,000,000 family members and friends provided more than 
        18,000,000,000 hours of unpaid care to individuals living with 
        Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in 2015;
Whereas nearly 60 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the 
        emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high;
Whereas nearly 40 percent of family caregivers for individuals living with 
        Alzheimer's disease and other dementias report symptoms of depression;
Whereas everyone who has a brain is at risk for Alzheimer's disease;
Whereas June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month;
Whereas the Alzheimer's Association established Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness 
        Month in 2014, and the inaugural Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month 
        was celebrated in June of that year; and
Whereas Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month is an opportunity to--

    (1) raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease and other dementias;

    (2) advocate for Alzheimer's research, care, and support services; and

    (3) offer support to individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and 
other dementias, their families, and their caregivers: Now, therefore, be 
it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Alzheimer's and Brain 
        Awareness Month; and
            (2) encourages people in the United States to--

                and other dementias;
                    (B) advocate for Alzheimer's research, care, and 
                support services; and

                Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, their 
                families, and their caregivers.
