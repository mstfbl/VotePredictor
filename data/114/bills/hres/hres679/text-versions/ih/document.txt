                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of May 2016 as ``National Brain 
                        Tumor Awareness Month''.

Whereas nearly 78,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with a 
        primary brain tumor this year, and up to 170,000 more will be diagnosed 
        with metastatic brain tumors that are the result of cancer spreading 
        from another part of the body to the brain;
Whereas brain tumors are the leading cause of death from cancer in children 
        under the age of 14, second leading cause of death from cancer for 
        children and teens under the age of 20, and third leading cause of death 
        from cancer in young adults ages 20 to 39;
Whereas the five-year relative survival rate in the United States following 
        diagnosis of a primary malignant brain and spinal tumor is only 34.4 
        percent;
Whereas over 16,000 people in the United States will lose their battle with a 
        brain tumor this year;
Whereas brain tumors may be either malignant or benign, but can be life-
        threatening in either case;
Whereas nearly 700,000 people in the United States are currently living with a 
        brain tumor;
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is complicated by the fact that there are more 
        than 120 different types of tumors;
Whereas the treatment and removal of brain tumors present significant challenges 
        because of the brain's uniquely complex and fragile nature;
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary organ in the human body that not only 
        controls cognitive ability, but the actions of every other organ and 
        limb in the body, leading to it being described as a disease that 
        affects the essence of self;
Whereas the first resolution recognizing the need for a ``National Brain Tumor 
        Awareness Month'' was passed by the House of Representatives on May 21, 
        2008;
Whereas brain tumor research is supported by a number of private nonprofit 
        research foundations and by institutes at the National Institutes of 
        Health, including the National Cancer Institute and National Institute 
        for Neurological Disorders and Stroke;
Whereas basic research advances may fuel research and development of new 
        treatments;
Whereas there still remain daunting obstacles to the development of new 
        treatments and there are no strategies for screening or early detection 
        of brain tumors;
Whereas despite the number of new people diagnosed with a brain tumor every 
        year, and their devastating prognosis, there have only been four FDA-
        approved drugs and one device to treat brain tumors in the past 30 
        years;
Whereas the four approved drugs for brain tumors have provided only incremental 
        improvements to patient survival, and mortality rates remain little 
        changed over the past 30 years;
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of brain tumors, including 
        the difficulties associated with research on these tumors and the 
        opportunities for advances in brain tumor research and treatment; and
Whereas May 2016, when brain tumor advocates nationwide unite in awareness, 
        outreach, and advocacy activities, would be an appropriate month to 
        recognize as National Brain Tumor Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Brain Tumor 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) encourages increased public awareness of brain tumors 
        to honor those who have lost their lives to this devastating 
        disease or are currently living with a brain tumor diagnosis;
            (3) supports efforts to develop better treatments for brain 
        tumors that will improve the quality of life and the long-term 
        prognosis of those individuals diagnosed with a brain tumor;
            (4) expresses its support for those individuals who are 
        battling brain tumors, as well as the families, friends, and 
        caregivers of those individuals; and
            (5) urges that a collaborative public-private approach to 
        brain tumor research is the best means of advancing knowledge 
        of and treatment for the disease.
