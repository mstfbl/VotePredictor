                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of July as National Sarcoma 
                            Awareness Month.

Whereas sarcoma is a cancer of connective tissues, such as nerves, muscles, 
        joints, fat, bones, and blood vessels, and it can arise any where in the 
        body;
Whereas more than 13,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with sarcoma 
        last year, more than 5,000 died, and 50,000 are struggling with the 
        disease at any one time;
Whereas 1 percent of the cancers diagnosed in adults and 15 percent of cancers 
        diagnosed in children each year are sarcoma;
Whereas more than 50 subtypes of sarcomas have been identified;
Whereas the National Cancer Institute recognizes that sarcoma is often 
        misdiagnosed and underreported; and
Whereas July would be an appropriate month to designate as National Sarcoma 
        Awareness Month to raise awareness of the disease and encourage more 
        individuals to get properly diagnosed and treated: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of National Sarcoma Awareness Month.
                                 <all>
