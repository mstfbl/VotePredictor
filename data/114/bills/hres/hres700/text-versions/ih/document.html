                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Cascade Head Preserve, an Oregon 
                             natural icon.

Whereas the 270-acre Cascade Head Preserve is located north of Lincoln City, 
        Oregon, and came to be protected from development in 1966;
Whereas, nestled within lands managed by the United States Forest Service, is 
        home to many species of wildlife, plants, and grassland communities that 
        were once abundant along the Oregon Coast;
Whereas the local community and volunteers helped protect the Cascade Head 
        Preserve 50 years ago and have remained actively engaged in its 
        stewardship along with The Nature Conservancy;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve and the adjacent segment of the Siuslaw National 
        Forest have been recognized as a National Scenic Research Area and a 
        United Nations Biosphere Reserve for its ecological significance;
Whereas an estimated 15,000 or more people visit the Cascade Head Preserve 
        annually and use it as nature's laboratory to learn about grassland 
        restoration and threatened species, such as the Oregon silverspot 
        butterfly, or to enjoy recreational activities along the Pacific Ocean 
        and its coastal estuaries;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve is known for harboring rare and endemic plants, 
        including 99 percent of the world's known Cascade Head catchfly 
        population;
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve has hosted teams of world-known ecologists and 
        experts from universities, zoological institutions, and Federal and 
        State agencies who have employed cutting-edge science to catch, rear in 
        captivity, and reintroduce the threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly;
Whereas tourism and recreation in Cascade Head Preserve have helped stimulate 
        the local economy by supporting several seasonal and full-time jobs and 
        driving economic activity along the Oregon Coast; and
Whereas Cascade Head Preserve also serves as nature's classroom to youth from 
        across the United States who learn about the importance of adjacent 
        habitats, including restoring tidal wetlands that provide vital salmon 
        habitat and the recent protection of 122 square miles of marine reserves 
        along the Oregon coast, which support community fisheries and local 
        livelihoods: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Cascade Head 
        Preserve; and
            (2) applauds the outstanding commitment of the Preserve's 
        stewards, naturalists, volunteers, and community leaders for 
        protecting the ecological significance of the Preserve and 
        supporting the local economy through tourism, recreation, and 
        local livelihoods.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
