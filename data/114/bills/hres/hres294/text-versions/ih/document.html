                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the continuation of the Perkins Loan Program.

Whereas the Perkins Loan Program is the Nation's longest running Federal student 
        loan program, created in 1958 as the National Defense Student Loan 
        Program and later called the National Direct Loan Program;
Whereas Perkins Loans are efficient, need-based, low-interest loans that serve 
        500,000 low-income college students with high need at some 1,500 
        colleges and universities each year;
Whereas Perkins Loans have favorable terms for students; for example, interest 
        is not charged while students are in school, the interest rate is low 
        and fixed, and borrowers may have all or part of their Perkins Loans 
        cancelled if they undertake certain public service jobs for one to five 
        years;
Whereas participating schools share the risk of the Perkins Loan Program because 
        they provide a one-third match to Federal capital contributions, and 
        loans are made using funds repaid by previous borrowers;
Whereas Perkins Loans features the human touch of campus-based servicing, which 
        allows on-campus administrators to provide Perkins borrowers with one-
        on-one service;
Whereas Perkins loans have made higher education possible for millions of 
        Americans; and
Whereas without Perkins Loans, thousands of Americans will lose the chance at 
        higher education and a better life: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly supports the 
continuation of the Perkins Loan Program in order to provide 
educational opportunities to future generations of students who need 
low-cost financing to make their dreams of higher education possible.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
