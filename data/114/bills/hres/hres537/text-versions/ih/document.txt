                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Federal law 
 prohibits the transfer of individuals detained at United States Naval 
          Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the 107 detainees currently imprisoned at United States 
        Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are imprisoned there for 
        various reasons relating to national security and the safety 
        and security of our allies and military forces around the 
        world;
            (2) the transfer or release of those 107 detainees would 
        present grave dangers and security risks to the foreign 
        countries where some may be released, and to the communities 
        and military installations at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 
        Charleston, South Carolina, and the community of Florence, 
        Colorado, that have been identified as possible transfer 
        locations;
            (3) sections 1032, 1033, and 2808 in the Carl Levin and 
        Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2015, clearly prohibits the use of funds to 
        construct or modify facilities in the United States to house 
        detainees transferred from United States Naval Station, 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the use of funds for the transfer or 
        release of individuals detained at United States Naval Station, 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the use of funds for the construction 
        of any new facilities at United States Naval Station, 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba;
            (4) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that to 
        do so would clearly and unequivocally violate Federal law and 
        the appropriations powers enumerated to Congress in article I, 
        section 9, clause 7 of the United States Constitution; and
            (5) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
        the President's continued planning and discussion of such a 
        closure and transfer of terrorists may result in illegal 
        actions committed by him.
                                 <all>
