                               RESOLUTION


 
  Calling for the maintenance of effective trade remedies for United 
States manufacturers and producers by ensuring that any foreign country 
designated as a nonmarket economy country under the Tariff Act of 1930 
   retain this status until it demonstrates that it meets all of the 
    criteria for treatment as a market economy set forth in section 
                        771(18)(B) of such Act.

Whereas fair international competition and a level playing field are essential 
        for the global competitiveness of United States manufacturers, farmers, 
        workers, and communities;
Whereas effective and predictable trade enforcement mechanisms must include the 
        assessment of and effective response to distortions in nonmarket 
        economies, which risk endangering United States jobs and the Nation's 
        economic security;
Whereas a nonmarket economy country for purposes of the United States 
        antidumping law is defined in section 771(18)(A) of the Tariff Act of 
        1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18)(A)) as ``any foreign country that the 
        administering authority determines does not operate on market principles 
        of cost or pricing structures, so that sales of merchandise in such 
        country do not reflect the fair value of the merchandise'';
Whereas a foreign country's pursuit of economic reforms, including the removal 
        or withdrawal of some state controls, is not a sufficient basis for 
        revocation of nonmarket economy status if its economy as a whole fails 
        to meet the criteria for treatment as a market economy country set forth 
        in section 771(18)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18)(B));
Whereas Congress has provided the above-referenced criteria to determine whether 
        market forces in a foreign country are sufficiently developed to permit 
        the use of prices and costs in that country for purposes of the 
        Department of Commerce's antidumping analysis;
Whereas the governments of some United States trading partners continue to play 
        a substantial and direct role in many critical aspects of their domestic 
        economies, including the financial system, upstream resource and energy 
        sectors, and through ownership and control of many strategic industries;
Whereas the governments of some United States trading partners at the central, 
        provincial, and local levels continue to subsidize production of key 
        commodities such as aluminum, cement, cotton, synthetic fiber, PET 
        resin, specialty chemicals, iron, and steel; and
Whereas subsidies and other market-distorting government policies hurt United 
        States businesses and workers by encouraging and supporting excess 
        production and exports onto world markets that result in significant 
        price suppression, price depression, or lost sales: Now, therefore be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls on the President to provide for the full and 
        effective application of United States antidumping and 
        countervailing duty laws against nonmarket economy countries;
            (2) calls on the President to retain the status of any 
        country currently designated as a nonmarket economy country 
        until it demonstrates that it meets all of the criteria for 
        treatment as a market economy set forth in section 771(18)(B) 
        of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677(18)(B));
            (3) calls on nonmarket economy countries to eliminate all 
        direct and indirect subsidies and other market-distorting 
        government policies benefitting the production and export of 
        goods to the United States; and
            (4) calls on nonmarket economy countries to enter into 
        binding and enforceable agreements for removing excess 
        production capacity and withdrawing state intervention in and 
        control over their economies.
                                 <all>
