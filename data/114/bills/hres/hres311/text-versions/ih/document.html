                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress 
should confirm that money is not free speech and that corporations are 
 not people for purposes of the First Amendment right to make campaign 
 contributions by enacting a constitutional amendment overturning the 
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Citizens United v. Federal 
 Election Commission, and should restore the right of Congress and the 
States to impose limits on the amount of expenditures that may be made 
 by candidates and others in support of elections for public office by 
  enacting a constitutional amendment overturning the decision of the 
             Supreme Court in the case of Buckley v. Valeo.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED 
              DECISION AND CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP FOR PURPOSES OF 
              POLITICAL ACTIVITY.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to 
overturn the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Citizens 
United v. Federal Election Commission (558 U.S. 310), Congress should 
enact and the States should ratify a constitutional amendment providing 
that any right of a corporation, other business organization, or other 
artificial entity to engage in political activity, including the making 
of contributions and expenditures for the purpose of influencing an 
election for public office or a ballot measure, is not derived from the 
first amendment but from the laws of the United States and the States, 
and may be exercised only to the extent provided by such laws.

SEC. 2. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN BUCKLEY DECISION.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to 
overturn the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Buckley v. 
Valeo (424 U.S. 1), Congress should enact and the States should ratify 
a constitutional amendment providing that Congress and the States have 
the authority to impose limits on the amount of expenditures that may 
be made by candidates and others in support of elections for public 
office.
