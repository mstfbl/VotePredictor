                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the three-year anniversary of the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals program, which permits young people who were brought 
to the United States by their parents as children to remain temporarily 
 in the United States and make meaningful contributions to our country.

Whereas the United States is a nation of immigrants and has embraced the 
        diversity they bring;
Whereas our Nation has thrived economically, socially, and culturally due to, 
        and has been further enriched by, the contributions of our past and most 
        recent immigrants;
Whereas young people, in particular, provide inspiration in their pursuit of the 
        American dream;
Whereas an estimated 1.4 million young immigrants are eligible to benefit from 
        the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program;
Whereas since the DACA program was launched in 2012, over 664,000 young people 
        have been reviewed and approved by Federal officials to receive 
        temporary and renewable work permits and Social Security numbers so they 
        can contribute to the country of which they feel the most a part;
Whereas 92 percent of DACA-eligible students over 18 years of age have at least 
        a high school education;
Whereas these young individuals provide a positive economic impact to the United 
        States, with a recent report finding that nearly 49 percent opened their 
        first bank account, 45 percent had increased job earnings, and 33 
        percent obtained their first credit card;
Whereas the economic, personal, and social impacts of the President's DACA 
        program display the overall benefits to our Nation;
Whereas while these young immigrants continue to advance and develop themselves, 
        76 percent still express concern about close, equally hardworking, 
        family members being deported;
Whereas the President has a plan to expand the highly successful DACA program 
        and include the parents of citizen and lawful permanent resident 
        children through the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful 
        Permanent Residents (DAPA) program; and
Whereas the personal and economic success of DACA recipients, and the economic 
        and fiscal benefits of the expanded DACA and DAPA programs, are 
        projected to result over the next 10 years in gains in the gross 
        domestic product of $230,000,000,000, create 28,814 jobs per year, and 
        increase the income of all people in the United States by 
        $124,000,000,000: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the three-year anniversary of the Deferred 
        Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which permits 
        young people who were brought to the United States by their 
        parents as children to remain temporarily in the United States 
        and make meaningful contributions to our country;
            (2) recognizes that young beneficiaries of the DACA program 
        have provided inspiration in their pursuit of the American 
        dream, which is the compelling story of all immigrants to our 
        country;
            (3) acknowledges that when we fully incorporate and 
        integrate hardworking immigrants in our country, then the 
        country only stands to benefit;
            (4) recognizes that the President's DACA program, along 
        with his recent constitutionally sound executive actions on 
        immigration (that include the Deferred Action for Parents of 
        Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents and expanded DACA 
        programs), serve as the precursor to legislative action; and
            (5) supports solutions to the problems of our broken 
        immigration system so our country can fully benefit from the 
        positive social and economic impacts of our immigrants.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
