    Resolved,

SECTION 1. PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) Congress has the power to prohibit voter suppression 
        activities;
            (2) in order to increase voter access and participation, 
        Congress should require every State to create and maintain an 
        online voter registration system and to automatically register 
        eligible voters whose information is contained in the State's 
        motor vehicle license registration system (with a 21-day opt-
        out period for those who wish to be taken off the registry); 
        and
            (3) Congress should make Election Day a legal public 
        holiday.
