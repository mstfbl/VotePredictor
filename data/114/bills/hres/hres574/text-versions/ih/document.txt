                               RESOLUTION


 
 Calling for a restoration of civil government in Thailand established 
by fair, free, democratic, and open elections and expressing solidarity 
       with the people of Thailand in their desire for democracy.

Whereas King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand has been a stabilizing leader in his 
        commitment to democracy, economic development, and prosperity for the 
        Thai people;
Whereas the people of Thailand seek the same freedoms and hold the same 
        democratic values as the people of the United States;
Whereas Thailand has been a long-time friend and valued ally of the United 
        States;
Whereas, on May 2014, in response to a crisis within Thailand and with the 
        support of most Thai people, the military assumed power temporarily to 
        restore civil order and safety;
Whereas the military leader of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), 
        General Prayuth Chan-ocha, exercises authority to issue constitutional 
        reform and call for democratic elections; and
Whereas the Constituent Committee completed the drafting of a new constitution 
        on August 29, 2015, which was rejected by the National Reform Council on 
        September 6, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls for a restoration of civil government in Thailand 
        established by fair, free, democratic, and open elections; and
            (2) expresses solidarity with the people of Thailand in 
        their desire for democracy.
                                 <all>
