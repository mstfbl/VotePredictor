                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the lack of full voting rights in Congress for active duty 
  service members, National Guard members, reservists, veterans, and 
         their families who are District of Columbia residents.

Whereas on the last Monday of May, our Nation observes Memorial Day, a Federal 
        holiday commemorating the men and women who died in the service of their 
        country;
Whereas the service and sacrifice of the active duty service members, National 
        Guard members, reservists, veterans, and their families is unparalleled;
Whereas the civilian population of the United States has the honor and privilege 
        of being protected by the active duty service members, National Guard 
        members, and reservists;
Whereas the active duty service members, National Guard members, reservists, and 
        veterans have risked life and limb to protect the American people and 
        uphold the rights and freedoms of the people of the United States;
Whereas the active duty service members, National Guard members, reservists, 
        veterans, and their families who are District of Columbia residents make 
        the same sacrifices as those who have full voting rights in Congress;
Whereas approximately 30,000 veterans are residents of the District of Columbia 
        and lack full voting rights in Congress;
Whereas residents of the District of Columbia fought to create the United 
        States, and have served in every war since;
Whereas 243 District of Columbia residents were casualties of the Vietnam War, 
        more than 10 States;
Whereas 547 District of Columbia residents were casualties of the Korean War, 
        more than 8 States;
Whereas 635 District of Columbia residents were casualties of World War I, more 
        than 3 States;
Whereas 3,575 District of Columbia residents were casualties of World War II, 
        more than 4 States;
Whereas 192,406 District of Columbia residents have served in the military since 
        World War I;
Whereas residents of the District of Columbia, including active duty service 
        members, National Guard members, reservists, and veterans are denied 
        full voting representation in the House of Representatives and the 
        Senate; and
Whereas Congress should pass H.R. 317, the New Columbia Admission Act, which 
        would grant full and equal voting representation and control over local 
        affairs to the residents of the District of Columbia by making it the 
        51st State: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the lack of 
full voting rights in Congress for active duty service members, 
National Guard members, reservists, veterans, and their families who 
are District of Columbia residents.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
