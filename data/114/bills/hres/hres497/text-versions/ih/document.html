                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating Army Reserve Major Lisa Jaster on her graduation from 
                        the Army Ranger School.

Whereas the Army Ranger School (referred to in this preamble as ``Ranger 
        School'') was established in 1950 during the Korean War to develop elite 
        leaders to command difficult combat missions;
Whereas Ranger School is one of the most challenging training courses for which 
        members of the Armed Forces may volunteer;
Whereas Ranger School pushes the physical and mental limits of students for more 
        than 2 months;
Whereas on average--

    (1) 36 percent of Ranger School students fail the course during the 
first 4 days after the date on which the course begins; and

    (2) only 45 percent of Ranger School students ultimately graduate from 
the course;

Whereas the Army Reserve is--

    (1) a highly trained force that comprises approximately 20 percent of 
the total Army; and

    (2) always available to meet the needs of the Army and Joint Force;

Whereas, on August 21, 2015, Army Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant 
        Shaye Haver became the first 2 women to graduate from Ranger School;
Whereas, on October 16, 2015, Major Lisa Jaster became the third woman, and the 
        first woman with the Army Reserve, to graduate from Ranger School and 
        earn the distinctive black and gold Ranger tab;
Whereas Major Lisa Jaster overcame the extreme fatigue, hunger, and stress 
        involved in Ranger training in order to graduate from Ranger School; and
Whereas Major Lisa Jaster has--

    (1) dedicated her life to serving and protecting the United States;

    (2) deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan; and

    (3) earned the Bronze Star and the Combat Action Badge: Now, therefore, 
be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors Major Lisa Jaster for the accomplishment of 
        becoming the first woman from the Army Reserve to graduate from 
        Ranger School;
            (2) commends the groundbreaking achievements of the first 3 
        women to graduate from Ranger School--
                    (A) Captain Kristen Griest;
                    (B) First Lieutenant Shaye Haver; and
                    (C) Major Lisa Jaster;
            (3) recognizes the vital role that the Army Reserve plays 
        in protecting and defending the United States; and
            (4) celebrates the determination, patriotism, and 
        willingness to lead of all Ranger School graduates.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
