                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
    States should adopt a national policy for technology to promote 
  consumers' access to financial tools and online commerce to promote 
               economic growth and consumer empowerment.

Whereas technology solutions have the potential to improve consumers' ability to 
        control their economic well-being, to encourage their financial 
        literacy, and improve their knowledge base and increase their options to 
        manage their finances and engage in commerce;
Whereas new payment methods and new payment strategies reflect new commercial 
        opportunities;
Whereas the United States is the world leader in software development and 
        technology creation;
Whereas financial technology is creating new opportunities for the 24,800,000 
        underbanked households in the United States;
Whereas the growth of consumers' use of mobile devices and the deployment of 
        broadband access has supported the growth of financial technology 
        products and services outside of traditional products and services 
        offered by banks and other financial institutions in the United States 
        increasing commerce and job growth;
Whereas identity theft is a rising concern for people in the United States as 
        their personal information is targeted by criminal enterprises for 
        monetization on the black market;
Whereas cyberattacks against domestic and international financial institutions 
        and cooperatives continue;
Whereas emerging payment options, including alternative non-fiat currencies, are 
        leveraging technology to improve security through increased transparency 
        and verifiable trust mechanisms to supplant decades old payment 
        technology deployed by traditional financial institutions; and
Whereas blockchain technology with the appropriate protections has the potential 
        to fundamentally change the manner in which trust and security are 
        established in online transactions through various potential 
        applications in sectors including financial services, payments, health 
        care, energy, property management, and intellectual property management: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the United States should develop a national policy to 
        encourage the development of tools for consumers to learn and 
        protect their assets in a way that maximizes the promise 
        customized, connected devices hold to empower consumers, foster 
        future economic growth, create new commerce and new markets;
            (2) the United States should prioritize accelerating the 
        development of alternative technologies that support 
        transparency, security, and authentication in a way that 
        recognizes their benefits, allows for future innovation, and 
        responsibly protects consumers' personal information;
            (3) the United States should recognize that technology 
        experts can play an important role in the future development of 
        consumer-facing technology applications for manufacturing, 
        automobiles, telecommunications, tourism, health care, energy, 
        and general commerce;
            (4) the United States should support further innovation, 
        and economic growth, and ensure cybersecurity, and the 
        protection of consumer privacy; and
            (5) innovators in technology, manufacturing, automobiles, 
        telecommunications, tourism, health care, and energy industries 
        should commit to improving the quality of life for future 
        generations by developing safe and consumer protective, new 
        technology aimed at improving consumers' access to commerce.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
