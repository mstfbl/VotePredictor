Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the American Educational Research 
  Association (AERA), the largest national interdisciplinary research 
association devoted to the scientific study of education and learning, 
     celebrating its achievements, and expressing support for the 
 designation of April 8, 2016, as ``National Education Research Day''.

Whereas in 1916, the American Educational Research Association (AERA) was 
        created with a mission to advance knowledge about education, encourage 
        scholarly inquiry related to education, and promote the use of research 
        to improve education and serve the public good;
Whereas AERA fosters innovation in research and learning, builds research 
        capacity, and connects high-quality research with practice and policy;
Whereas AERA continues to meet its mission through the publication of academic 
        journals, books, and timely statements on critical education issues;
Whereas AERA journals are all widely respected and highly ranked nationally and 
        internationally, including the number one journal in the field of 
        education research;
Whereas AERA has members in every State and in 85 countries worldwide;
Whereas AERA's 25,000 members are committed to high-quality research that yields 
        cumulative and replicable findings of value for improving education and 
        to making this research accessible to practitioners, policy makers, and 
        the general public;
Whereas AERA convenes an annual meeting that is the largest gathering of 
        education researchers in the world, bringing together more than 15,000 
        attendees, discussing highly rigorous research on critical education 
        topics;
Whereas AERA hosts the annual Brown Lecture in Education Research to share 
        significant research on equity and equality in education, as well as 
        numerous research conferences on pressing education questions ranging 
        from early childhood education to school rules and discipline;
Whereas AERA provides professional development opportunities for education 
        researchers at all career stages with a commitment to excellence and 
        inclusion;
Whereas AERA introduces undergraduates to the field of education research, 
        builds capacity, offers dissertation funding for graduate students, as 
        well as supports fellowships for post-doctoral and early career 
        researchers, delivers professional development opportunities for 
        established researchers to engage the latest state of the art research 
        methods and practices, and dedicates resources for underrepresented 
        minorities;
Whereas AERA provides leadership to the field in communicating the findings of 
        education researchers and building awareness and appreciation for the 
        value of high-quality education research;
Whereas AERA has a long tradition of working in collaboration with the Federal 
        Government to support the field of education research; and
Whereas April 8, 2016, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National 
        Education Research Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Education 
        Research Day'';

        (AERA) on the occasion of its 100th anniversary;
            (3) recognizes the great impact that AERA has had on 
        enhancing the quality of education research and promoting its 
        application to improve educational policy and practice; and
            (4) congratulates AERA for its achievements and encourages 
        the organization to continue providing support and leadership 
        to the field of education research to improve the quality of
