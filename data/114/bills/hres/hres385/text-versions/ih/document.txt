                               RESOLUTION


 
Declaring the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives vacant.

Whereas the Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress has 
        endeavored to consolidate power and centralize decisionmaking, bypassing 
        the majority of the 435 Members of Congress and the people they 
        represent;
Whereas the Speaker has, through inaction, caused the power of Congress to 
        atrophy, thereby making Congress subservient to the executive and 
        judicial branches, diminishing the voice of the American people;
Whereas the Speaker uses the power of the office to punish Members who vote 
        according to their conscience instead of the will of the Speaker;
Whereas the Speaker has intentionally provided for voice votes on consequential 
        and controversial legislation to be taken without notice and with few 
        Members present;
Whereas the Speaker uses the legislative calendar to create crises for the 
        American people, in order to compel Members to vote for legislation;
Whereas the Speaker does not comply with the spirit of the rules of the House of 
        Representatives, which provide that Members shall have three days to 
        review legislation before voting;
Whereas the Speaker continues to direct the Rules Committee to limit meaningful 
        amendments, to limit debate on the House floor, and to subvert a 
        straightforward legislative process; and
Whereas the House of Representatives, to function effectively in the service of 
        all citizens of this country, requires the service of a Speaker who will 
        endeavor to follow an orderly and inclusive process without imposing his 
        or her will upon any Member thereof: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the office of Speaker of the House of 
Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.
                                 <all>
