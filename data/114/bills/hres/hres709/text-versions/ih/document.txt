  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, by 
   failing to adhere to international maritime law, ignoring United 
  Nations resolutions, and conducting military operations in a manner 
that raises tensions within the Arabian Gulf, has undermined stability 
 in the Arabian Gulf, raised the danger of inadvertent escalation, and 
    increased the risk to members of the United States Armed Forces 
                               overseas.

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, by 
   failing to adhere to international maritime law, ignoring United 
  Nations resolutions, and conducting military operations in a manner 
that raises tensions within the Arabian Gulf, has undermined stability 
 in the Arabian Gulf, raised the danger of inadvertent escalation, and 
    increased the risk to members of the United States Armed Forces 
                               overseas.

Whereas Iranian military and paramilitary vessels have repeatedly behaved in a 
        dangerous and unprofessional manner in close proximity to naval vessels 
        and commercial shipping operating in internationally recognized maritime 
        traffic lanes;
Whereas Iranian forces did conduct live firing exercises within 1500 yards of 
        the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman in December 2015;
Whereas Iranian military aircraft flew over the Harry S. Truman and the French 
        aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in January 2016;
Whereas, on January 12, 2016, Iranian forces illegally boarded and detained at 
        gunpoint the crews of two U.S. Navy riverine combat boats that were in 
        distress;
Whereas Iranian actions on January 12 violated international maritime law and 
        practice regarding the right of innocent passage and the sovereign 
        immunity of naval vessels; and
Whereas United States Armed Forces in the Arabian Gulf have continuously acted 
        in accordance with international law and maritime practice, to include 
        assisting Iranian mariners in distress: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) believes that the actions of Iranian military and 
        paramilitary forces in the Arabian Gulf undermined stability in 
        the Arabian Gulf, raised the danger of inadvertent escalation 
        and increased the risk to members of the United States Armed 
        Forces overseas;
            (2) calls on the military and paramilitary forces of Iran 
        to act in accordance with international law and standards for 
        conduct at sea;
            (3) urges the Administration to strongly respond to past 
        and future instances of dangerous and unprofessional behavior 
        by Iranian forces; and
            (4) pledges to consider the behavior of Iranian military 
        and paramilitary forces, along with other relevant 
        considerations, when considering or debating any legislation 
        that pertains to Iran, including sanctions and arms control 
        agreements.
