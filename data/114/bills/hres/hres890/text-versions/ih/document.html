Expressing support for the Arctic Council and commemorating the Arctic 
                       Council 20th anniversary.

Whereas, on September 19, 1996, the Arctic Council was established with the 
        signing of the Ottawa Declaration;
Whereas the Arctic Council is an intergovernmental body that promotes 
        international cooperation on Arctic issues;
Whereas the United States along with Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, 
        Russia, and Sweden comprise the Arctic Council member states;
Whereas the Arctic Council offers a platform in the international arena for 
        indigenous communities to ensure they have a voice about what happens in 
        their region;
Whereas the Arctic Council helps the Arctic remain a stable zone of peaceful 
        international interaction;
Whereas the Arctic Council serves to ensure safe, sustainable tourism and 
        commercial maritime traffic in the region;
Whereas the Arctic Council works to protect the Arctic marine environment and 
        address the impacts of climate change;
Whereas the Arctic Council provides a collaborative forum for scientific 
        research on topics including ocean acidification, sea floor mapping, and 
        future Arctic Ocean navigability; and
Whereas the United States current chairmanship of the Arctic Council offers an 
        opportunity to promote and implement our policy objectives: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the Arctic 
Council's work and remains committed to ensuring that the United States 
fulfills its responsibilities as an Arctic nation and asserts 
leadership on issues affecting the Arctic.
