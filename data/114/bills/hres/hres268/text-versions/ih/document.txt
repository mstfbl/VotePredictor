                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of July 2015 as Uterine Fibroids Awareness 
                                 Month.

Whereas fibroids may cause significant morbidity through their presence in the 
        uterus and pelvic cavity causing significant pelvic pain, abnormal 
        uterine bleeding, reproductive dysfunction, miscarriages, and even 
        infertility;
Whereas the pain, discomfort, stress, and other physical and emotional symptoms 
        of living with fibroids may significantly interfere with a woman's 
        quality of life, compromising her ability to function normally, work or 
        care for her family; and may lead to more severe health and wellness 
        issues;
Whereas uterine fibroids are the most prevalent medical condition affecting 
        women, with an estimated 30 percent of women developing a uterine 
        fibroid by age 35, and 80 percent of women developing a uterine fibroid 
        by age 50;
Whereas the exact number of affected women is unknown as detection and diagnosis 
        is difficult as only 1 out of 4 women who have a uterine fibroid tumor 
        exhibit symptoms severe enough to require treatment;
Whereas the overall incidence of uterine fibroid tumors is estimated to 
        disproportionately and more severely impact Black and Hispanic women, 
        resulting in an incidence rate that is 3 times greater in women with 
        Black ancestry and 2 times greater in Hispanic women compared to 
        Caucasian women;
Whereas a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is among the most common 
        surgical treatments for uterine fibroids and more than 200,000 
        hysterectomies are performed each year to treat uterine fibroids, at an 
        estimated annual cost of more than $2 billion;
Whereas uterine fibroid tumors were estimated to cost the United States $5.9 
        billion to $34.4 billion annually with an estimated annual lost work 
        cost of $1.6 billion to $17.2 billion through absenteeism and short-term 
        disability in women age 25 to 54; and
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on uterine fibroids prevention, 
        screening, and symptoms are held during the month of July each year: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideas of Uterine Fibroids 
        Awareness Month;
            (2) recognizes the disparity in incidence rates of African-
        American and Hispanic uterine fibroid patients;
            (3) recognizes the need for greater research, treatment, 
        and care options regarding uterine leiomyoma; and
            (4) encourages the President to issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States to observe the 
        month with appropriate awareness and educational activities.
                                 <all>
