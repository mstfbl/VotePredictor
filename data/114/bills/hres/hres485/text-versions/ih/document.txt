                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing solidarity with the people of Israel in the wake of recent 
terrorist attacks and condemning the Palestinian Authority for inciting 
                       an atmosphere of violence.

Whereas the United States is the single largest donor to the Palestinians, 
        having committed over $5,000,000,000 in bilateral assistance with the 
        aims of preventing terrorism against Israel from Hamas and other 
        military organizations; fostering stability, prosperity, and self-
        governance in the West Bank; and meeting humanitarian needs;
Whereas the Palestinian Authority makes payments to terrorists who are in 
        Israeli jails;
Whereas the Oslo II Agreement specifically details that Israel and the 
        Palestinian Authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile 
        propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the 
        principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent 
        such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their 
        jurisdiction'';
Whereas no aid is permitted for a power-sharing Palestinian Authority government 
        that includes Hamas as a member, or that results from an agreement with 
        Hamas and over which Hamas exercises ``undue influence'' unless the 
        President certifies that the Palestinian Authority government, including 
        all ministers, has ``publicly accepted and is complying with'' 
        conditions that they recognize the Jewish state of Israel's right to 
        exist and accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements;
Whereas Fatah and Hamas agreed to the June 2014 formation of a consensus 
        Palestinian Authority government;
Whereas Hamas retains de facto control over the Gaza Strip;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in September 2015 
        that ``Each drop of blood that was spilled in Jerusalem is pure blood as 
        long as it's for the sake of Allah. Every shahid (martyr) will be in 
        heaven and every wounded person will be rewarded, by Allah's will.'';
Whereas, on October 14, 2015, President Mahmoud Abbas falsely accused the 
        Government of Israel of executing a Palestinian boy, who is alive and 
        recovering in an Israeli hospital after he stabbed an innocent Israeli 
        citizen and was hit by an automobile, thus continuing to incite violence 
        against innocent Israelis; and
Whereas seven people have been killed and dozens have been wounded in several 
        terrorist attacks against Israelis committed by Palestinians from 
        September 13, 2015, through October 14, 2015, including--

    (1) a September 13th attack on a personal vehicle in Jerusalem which 
resulted in the driver's death;

    (2) an October 1st attack in Samaria where a rabbi and his wife were 
murdered in front of their four children;

    (3) an October 3rd attack in Jerusalem where a young man was stabbed to 
death in front of his wife and child, who also suffered wounds;

    (4) an October 4th attack in Jerusalem where a teenager was stabbed;

    (5) a series of attacks on October 7th involving a knife attack at a 
shopping mall, an attack on a woman driving her car in Tekoa, a stabbing in 
the Old City of Jerusalem, and an attack on an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) 
soldier near Tel Aviv;

    (6) a series of attacks on October 8th involving a stabbing of a female 
IDF soldier and three others in Tel Aviv, a stabbing in Jerusalem, a 
stabbing near Hebron, and a stabbing of an IDF soldier near Galilee;

    (7) a series of attacks on October 9th involving 5 children wounded by 
rocks, a boy beaten and stabbed in Jerusalem, a police officer who was 
stabbed near Hebron, and a woman whose car was attacked near Jerusalem;

    (8) a series of attacks on October 10th involving 2 elderly men who 
were stabbed in Jerusalem, 2 police officers who were stabbed in Jerusalem, 
a bus driver who was injured in Jerusalem, and a woman who was injured 
while driving south of Jerusalem;

    (9) a series of attacks on October 11th involving a police officer who 
was injured when an explosive device was detonated during a traffic stop, 
and four people, including a girl celebrating her 15th birthday, who were 
injured when a terrorist rammed his car into the victims and proceeded to 
stab them;

    (10) a series of attacks on October 12th involving a stabbing in 
Jerusalem, a border policeman who was stabbed in Jerusalem, a man and a 13-
year-old boy who were stabbed in Jerusalem, and a soldier who was stabbed 
on a bus in Jerusalem;

    (11) a series of attacks on October 13th involving the stabbing of five 
people north of Tel Aviv, a shooting and stabbing on a bus in Jerusalem, 
and the stabbing and shooting of 5 people, including a rabbi, in Jerusalem; 
and

    (12) a series of attacks in Jerusalem on October 14th involving a woman 
who was stabbed at a bus station and a terrorist who attacked armed guards: 
Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support for the recent terrorism victims and 
        their families in Israel, the people of Israel, and the 
        Government of Israel;
            (2) condemns terrorism committed under the auspices of the 
        Palestinian Authority;
            (3) calls on Palestinian leaders to cease supporting, 
        justifying, inciting, or allowing terrorist activities in 
        Israel;
            (4) urges the President of the United States to 
        emphatically condemn the attacks carried out against innocent 
        Israelis and freeze all United States funding to the 
        Palestinian Authority until their leaders openly increase 
        efforts to end their incitement of violence;
            (5) is concerned about the use of national security waivers 
        to continue supplying aid to the Palestinian Authority; and
            (6) demands, as a condition of continued United States aid 
        consistent with section 620K of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
        1961 (22 U.S.C. 2378b), as added by the Palestinian Anti-
        Terrorism Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-449; 120 Stat. 3318), 
        that the President re-certify that the Palestinian Authority 
        government, including all ministers, has publicly accepted and 
        is complying with the principles of such section 620K, which 
        demand the recognition of Israel's right to exist and the 
        acceptance of previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.
                                 <all>
