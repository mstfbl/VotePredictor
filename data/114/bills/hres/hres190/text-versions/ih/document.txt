                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the fourth week in April as 
                        Every Kid Healthy Week.

Whereas childhood obesity, undernourishment, and physical inactivity are 
        national epidemics, and schools can help to address these problems by 
        becoming healthier places so kids can live healthier lives and be better 
        prepared to learn;
Whereas 1 in 3 of the Nation's children are overweight or obese which puts those 
        children at a high risk for developing heart disease, cancer, asthma, 
        and diabetes;
Whereas the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that only 27.1 percent of high 
        school students were physically active for at least 60 minutes per day 
        on each of the 7 days before the survey, with 37.5 percent of male 
        students and 17.7 percent of female students reporting this level of 
        activity;
Whereas the 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that less than half (48 
        percent) of high school students attended physical education classes 1 
        or more days in an average week when they were in school, with only 29.4 
        percent attending physical education classes daily while in school;
Whereas the percentage of high school students who attended physical education 
        classes daily has decreased over time, from 41.6 percent in 1991 to 29.4 
        percent in 2013, as measured by the Youth Risk Behavior Survey;
Whereas every child needs a healthy diet consisting of nutritious foods in 
        appropriate portion sizes based on age and development;
Whereas evidence shows children who eat poorly or who engage in too little 
        physical activity do not perform as well as they could academically;
Whereas the primary goal of Every Kid Healthy Week is to be an annual observance 
        when schools, students, parents, and community members come together to 
        recognize their school's wellness achievements through fun, engaging, 
        and health-focused events;
Whereas over 1,000 schools are participating in 2015;
Whereas a coalition of leading public and private organizations engaged in child 
        and school health has been formed for a collective impact initiative 
        working toward a common vision that all United States schools will 
        provide healthy foods, quality health and physical education, and 
        comprehensive physical activity opportunities for all students by 2030;
Whereas Every Kid Healthy Week will act as a focal point for year-round 
        programming related to the Nation's childhood obesity epidemic as well 
        as its solutions: sound nutrition, regular physical activity, and 
        health-promoting school programs; and
Whereas the designation of the fourth week in April as Every Kid Healthy Week 
        will bring national attention to the importance of keeping kids fit and 
        healthy, and will provide an opportunity to emphasize the significance 
        of making the choices necessary to sustain a healthy and physically 
        active lifestyle: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Every Kid Healthy Week; and
            (2) honors and recognizes the importance of promoting 
        healthy lifestyles and healthy learning environments for all 
        children.
                                 <all>
