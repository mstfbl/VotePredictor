                               RESOLUTION


 
   Providing assistance to Ukraine for fulfillment of the economic, 
  social, and government reform requirements necessary for membership 
   eligibility to the European Union, in keeping with the will of a 
        majority of the people of Ukraine and their Government.

Whereas the recent 2014 Ukrainian Parliamentary election illustrated the will of 
        a majority of the people of Ukraine by electing officials from the 
        Poroshenko, People's Front, Self-Reliance, and Batkivshchyna parties;
Whereas the aforementioned parties share pro-reform and pro-European Union 
        Platforms;
Whereas the aforementioned parties won a combined 62 percent of the party-list 
        vote;
Whereas the Ukrainian Government agreed to nuclear disarmament in 1994 by 
        signing the Budapest Memorandum with the understanding that their 
        territorial integrity and political independence would be respected, 
        secured, and assisted by the nations in agreement with this memorandum;
Whereas the current status quo regarding Ukraine remains unacceptable and the 
        curtailing of aggression toward Ukraine remains a desirable foreign 
        policy objective;
Whereas recent developments in Ukraine highlight the dire need of extensive 
        social, economic, and government reform;
Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, Public Law 113-272, authorizes the 
        Administration to provide the Ukrainian Government with the means 
        necessary to support and facilitate these necessary reforms, including 
        immediate financial and defensive military aid;
Whereas Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has explicitly stated and outlined 
        a plan for Ukraine to complete the social and economic reforms necessary 
        to apply for membership to the European Union by 2020;
Whereas European Union-Commissioner Johannes Hahn has, on the date of November 
        26, 2014, stated that ``. . . swift and concrete implementation of the 
        reform agenda is now urgent, to make Ukraine a stable, prosperous and 
        well-governed modern state''; and
Whereas eventual membership will bring significant benefits to Ukraine, 
        including new economic opportunities, access to new markets, a freer 
        exchange of goods and services, as well as balanced and substantial 
        development: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
                    (A) the various agencies of the United States 
                Government should provide assistance to Ukraine for 
                fulfillment of the economic, social, and government 
                reform requirements necessary for membership 
                eligibility to the European Union;
                    (B) the President should immediately follow through 
                on Public Law 113-272, the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, 
                providing Ukraine with immediate financial and 
                defensive military aid;
                    (C) President Petro Poroshenko should continue his 
                efforts in fighting corruption, building civil society, 
                and creating an inclusive and tolerant society for all 
                of Ukraine's citizens; and
                    (D) upon the Ukrainian achievement of reforms 
                necessary for eligibility to the European Union, 
                membership of Ukraine in the European Union should be 
                strongly supported, in keeping with the will of the 
                majority of the people of Ukraine and their Government; 
                and
            (2) the House of Representatives expresses solidarity with 
        the Ukrainian people.
                                 <all>
