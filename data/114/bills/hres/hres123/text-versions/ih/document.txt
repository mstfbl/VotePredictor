                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for designation of August 6 as National Voting 
                              Rights Day.

Whereas the landmark Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon 
        B. Johnson on August 6, 1965;
Whereas the Voting Rights Act is arguably the Nation's most important law for 
        removing race-based restrictions on voting and has stood as an essential 
        safeguard against racial discrimination in our political system since 
        its inception;
Whereas prior to its passage, African-Americans were often systematically 
        prevented from voting by tactics such as literacy tests, poll taxes, the 
        grandfather clause, and intimidation and violence;
Whereas in response a violent backlash sparked by efforts to register Black 
        voters in the Deep South in the 1960s, the Johnson Administration 
        proposed the enactment of a voting rights law which provided for direct 
        Federal intervention to uphold the guarantees of the fifteenth 
        amendment;
Whereas the Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965 to rectify years of 
        disenfranchisement of African-American voters by prohibiting States from 
        imposing qualifications or practices to deny access to the ballot on 
        account of race, permitted direct Federal intervention in the electoral 
        process in certain places based on a specific formula, and required 
        preclearance of new laws in covered States to ensure that they did not 
        have the purpose or effect of limiting the ability to vote on account of 
        race;
Whereas following enactment of this critically important legislation, Black 
        voter registration and participation increased dramatically;
Whereas the Voting Rights Act has had a significant impact on electoral dynamics 
        by vastly expanding the number of African-American, Hispanic, and women 
        elected officials on both a local and national level;
Whereas the recent Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder and State 
        laws that place restrictions on voters have dealt a heavy blow to voter 
        protections nationwide;
Whereas although progress has undoubtedly been made in the 49 years since the 
        Voting Rights Act was passed, sadly, discrimination continues to exist; 
        and
Whereas the Nation must remain committed to the fight to create an open and 
        transparent electoral process for all United States citizens: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Voting Rights 
        Day'' in commemoration of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the 
        enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965;
            (2) acknowledges the significance of the Voting Rights Act 
        with regard to enforcing the civil rights of all United States 
        citizens; and
            (3) emphasizes the importance of ensuring the ability of 
        all United States citizens to fully participate in the 
        electoral process.
                                 <all>
