H. Res. 827

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         July 13, 2016.
Whereas, in the early hours of Sunday, June 12, 2016, a 29-year-old man from Ft. 
        Pierce, Florida, killed 49 and wounded 53 innocent people in a horrific 
        terrorist attack on Pulse Orlando, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
        transgender nightclub, during Latin night;
Whereas the gunman, who was investigated in 2013-2014 by the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation (in this preamble referred to as the ``FBI'') for possible 
        connections to terrorism, pledged his allegiance to the leader of the 
        Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (in this preamble referred to as 
        ``ISIL'');
Whereas President Barack Obama called the attack an act of both terror and hate 
        as well as an attack on all of the people of the United States and the 
        fundamental values of equality and dignity;
Whereas the attack is the deadliest mass shooting in the modern history of the 
        United States and the worst terrorist attack on United States soil since 
        September 11, 2001;
Whereas the law enforcement professionals of the city of Orlando and Orange 
        County, Florida, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the FBI, and 
        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and other 
        emergency and health care professionals responded to the attack bravely 
        and admirably and in a coordinated manner, saving many lives;
Whereas following the attack hundreds of people stood in long lines to donate 
        blood for those injured in the attack, and the people of Orlando, the 
        State of Florida, and the United States expressed overwhelming support 
        for the victims and their families regardless of race, ethnicity, 
        religion, sex, or sexual orientation; and
Whereas the threat of terrorist attacks against the United States and the people 
        of the United States persists, including the threat posed by homegrown 
        terrorists inspired by foreign terrorist organizations like ISIL: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the horrific terrorist attack on the Pulse Orlando 
        nightclub on June 12, 2016, in which 49 innocent people were killed and 
        53 injured;
            (2) honors the memory of the victims killed in the attack and offers 
        heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies for their families, loved 
        ones, and friends;
            (3) expresses hope for a full and speedy recovery by and pledges 
        continued support for those injured in the attack;
            (4) applauds the dedication and bravery of local, State, and Federal 
        law enforcement and counterterrorism officials for their efforts to 
        respond to the attack and secure communities;
            (5) stands together with all people of the United States, regardless 
        of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or sexual orientation, in the face of 
        terror and hate; and
            (6) reaffirms the commitment of the United States and its allies to 
        defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and other terrorist 
        groups at home and abroad and to address the threat posed by homegrown 
        terrorism.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
