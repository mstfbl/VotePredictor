                               RESOLUTION


 
         Condemning violence that targets healthcare for women.

Whereas the constitutional right of women to make healthcare decisions about 
        their bodies has been an established right for over 43 years;
Whereas in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), the Supreme Court confirmed 
        the constitutional right of all women to legally access birth control;
Whereas the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), 42 years ago 
        and reaffirmed that women have a constitutional right to comprehensive 
        reproductive healthcare;
Whereas for decades, healthcare providers for women and people who access 
        healthcare services for women have been subjected to intimidation, 
        threats, and violence;
Whereas since 1993, there have been 11 murders and numerous attempted murders of 
        individuals associated with care provided at health centers for women;
Whereas since 1977--

    (1) nearly 7,000 violent acts have been reported against providers at 
health centers for women, including bombings, arsons, death threats, 
kidnappings, and assaults; and

    (2) more than 190,000 acts of disruption, including bomb threats and 
harassing calls, have been reported;

Whereas between June and December 2015, arson, vandalism, and threats have 
        increased at Planned Parenthood health centers and other health centers 
        for women, including--

    (1) health centers in--

    G    (A) Aurora, Illinois;

    G    (B) Pullman, Washington;

    G    (C) Louisville, Kentucky; and

    G    (D) Claremont, New Hampshire; and

    (2) on November 27, 2015, an attack by a gunman at a Planned Parenthood 
health center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which 3 people were killed 
and 9 people were injured;

Whereas extreme rhetoric contributes to a climate that is dangerous for 
        individuals who provide or access comprehensive healthcare services;
Whereas since more than 40 percent of the patients of Planned Parenthood are 
        people of color, people of color are disproportionately impacted by 
        attacks on health centers for women; and
Whereas over their lifetimes, 1 in 5 women in the United States will access 
        healthcare at Planned Parenthood, which--

    (1) in 2013 provided--

    G    (A) over 1,400,000 emergency contraception kits;

    G    (B) nearly 4,500,000 tests and treatments for sexually transmitted 
infections; and

    G    (C) nearly 900,000 cervical cancer screenings and breast exams;

    (2) continues to be the leading reproductive healthcare provider in the 
United States; and

    (3) along with many other reproductive health providers, continues to 
provide expert, quality reproductive healthcare in safe and supportive 
environments across the country: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) denounces the attacks on healthcare centers for women, 
        providers of healthcare for women, and patients; and
            (2) affirms that all women have the right to access 
        reproductive healthcare services without fear of violence, 
        intimidation, or harassment.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
