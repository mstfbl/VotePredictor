                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the sense of the House recognizing and honoring 
                    the Fire Department of New York.

Whereas 2015 marks the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the modern, 
        paid Fire Department of New York (referred to in this resolution as the 
        ``FDNY'');
Whereas the city's first firehouse was constructed in 1736 and in 1737 the then-
        Colonial General Assembly created a fire department staffed by 
        volunteers;
Whereas in 1865 the FDNY was established as a paid, professional organization;
Whereas approximately 15,000 staff of the FDNY proudly serve today and the FDNY 
        is the largest fire department in the United States;
Whereas members of the FDNY are responsible for saving the lives of countless 
        New Yorkers and visitors over the past century and a half;
Whereas during the September 11, 2001, attacks, thousands of FDNY members 
        heroically raced to the scene to put out fires and save lives;
Whereas 343 FDNY firefighters, EMTs, and paramedics who responded to the 9/11 
        attacks lost their own lives;
Whereas according to the FDNY, over 1,150 members of FDNY have lost their lives 
        serving the people of New York since the founding of the modern 
        Department;
Whereas the service of the FDNY isn't limited to New York City, and FDNY members 
        have helped respond to disasters throughout the country including 
        Hurricane Katrina, the Oklahoma City bombing, Hurricane Isaac, and the 
        Haiti Earthquake through the Disaster Assistance Response Team;
Whereas members of the FDNY go beyond fighting fires in their service to the 
        community, logging countless hours contributing to charities and 
        community organizations;
Whereas the motto of FDNY, ``New York's Bravest'' properly recognizes the 
        courage, tenacity, skillfulness and perseverance of the members of the 
        FDNY: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the United States House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the 150th anniversary of the founding of 
        the modern Fire Department of New York;
            (2) recognizes the courage and perseverance of the members 
        of the Fire Department of New York;
            (3) mourns the loss of the members of the Fire Department 
        of New York who have made the ultimate sacrifice; and
            (4) expresses its deep respect to the current and former 
        men, women and families of the Fire Department of New York for 
        their service to New York City, the United States, and the 
        world.
                                 <all>
