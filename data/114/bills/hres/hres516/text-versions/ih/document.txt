                            November 4, 2015

Mr. Wenstrup submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                    the Committee on Armed Services

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the individuals who have served, or are serving, in the 
 Armed Forces and have also served, or are serving, as a peace officer 
 or as a first responder and expressing support for the designation of 
 November 10 as Armed Forces, Peace Officer, and First Responder Dual 
                        Service Recognition Day.

Whereas members of the Armed Forces, peace officers, and first responders choose 
        to run toward danger rather than away from it in times of need;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces, peace officers, and first responders serve 
        and defend the public safety 365 days a year;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces, peace officers, and first responders often 
        fail to receive recognition or appreciation for their consistent acts of 
        service;
Whereas it is particularly fitting to recognize individuals who are twice the 
        servant, placing themselves at risk to defend the United States in the 
        Armed Forces and sacrificing to protect and serve communities in the 
        United States as a peace officer or as a first responder; and
Whereas November 10 would be an appropriate date to designate as Armed Forces, 
        Peace Officer, and First Responder Dual Service Recognition Day in 
        recognition of the selfless Americans who have served in the Armed 
        Forces and as a peace officer or as a first responder: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes and honors individuals who have chosen to 
        serve in the Armed Forces and also as a peace officer or as a 
        first responder; and
            (2) supports the designation of Armed Forces, Peace 
        Officer, and First Responder Dual Service Recognition Day.
                                 <all>
