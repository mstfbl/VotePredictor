                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House relating to the dispute between the 
   Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshore and 
       Warehouse Union impacting operations of West Coast ports.

Whereas the ongoing contract negotiation between the Pacific Maritime 
        Association and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, 
        relating to a collective bargaining agreement, has impacted the 
        operations of 29 West Coast ports, where 20,000 dockworkers work;
Whereas the parties began negotiating a new contract in May, 2014, and the 
        previous contract expired in July of 2014;
Whereas this negotiation and its impact on the movement of goods has sent 
        harmful economic reverberations far beyond the shipping industry and the 
        West Coast to farms, manufacturing plants, retail establishments, and 
        communities across the country;
Whereas the efficient flow of goods is critical to the regional and national 
        economy;
Whereas, in 2013, according to the Department of Commerce, imports and exports 
        comprised 30 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product, as the 
        Nation's total trade reached $5 trillion;
Whereas over 12 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product travels through 
        those ports and the flow of goods in and out of those ports is critical 
        to the operation of businesses, farms, and factories, to both retailers 
        and consumers, and to millions of jobs all across the United States;
Whereas the impacted operations of all West Coast transport by sea has already 
        prevented farmers from selling their crops overseas, resulted in 
        layoffs, slowed manufacturing production, idled trucks and trains, 
        increased costs on businesses, and forced small businesses to shut their 
        doors;
Whereas, due to the interruption of the flow of commerce caused by the dispute, 
        manufacturers, farmers, retailers, and other stakeholders are losing 
        customers, market share, and millions of dollars a week;
Whereas a shutdown of these ports in 2002 cost the Nation's economy over $1 
        billion a day and estimates suggest another shutdown would be even more 
        costly; and
Whereas, if there is a shutdown of those ports, the shutdown will present a 
        serious threat to the Nation's safety and health: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Pacific Maritime Association and the International 
        Longshore and Warehouse Union should swiftly conclude their 
        contract negotiations with the assistance of a Federal 
        mediator; and
            (2) if the Pacific Maritime Association and the 
        International Longshore and Warehouse Union do not reach a 
        settlement and a shutdown occurs, the President should use all 
        tools at his disposal to end the dispute, including his 
        authority under the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 
        (commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act) to intervene in the 
        matter to protect the Nation's economy.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
