                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of May 25 as ``National Moonshot 
     Day'' and recognizing the importance of conquering scientific 
             challenges from medicine to space and beyond.

Whereas, on May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy gave a historic speech 
        before a Joint Session of Congress announcing his goal of putting a man 
        on the Moon by the end of the decade;
Whereas Kennedy stated, ``Now it is time to take longer strides--time for a 
        great new American enterprise--time for this nation to take a clearly 
        leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key 
        to our future on Earth'';
Whereas the successes of the Apollo program proved that when United States 
        citizens unite behind a common goal, even when that goal requires 
        ``longer strides'', we can accomplish anything;
Whereas Kennedy also stated, ``I believe we possess all the resources and 
        talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never 
        made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required 
        for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an 
        urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to 
        insure their fulfillment'';
Whereas all across the Nation, there are youth waiting to be inspired to develop 
        and dedicate their talents toward the next great challenges just as 
        President Kennedy inspired a generation to achieve the goal of sending 
        astronauts to the Moon;
Whereas without similar dedication, attention, and leadership we will fail as a 
        country to inspire and recruit the next generation to do the important 
        work ahead from medicine to space and beyond;
Whereas, as part of a renewed focus on science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (STEM), making tangible connections between their classwork 
        and the future of the Nation would help many students understand the 
        importance of their education and work; and
Whereas May 25 is the anniversary of the day President John F. Kennedy set the 
        United States on a course to the Moon and would be an appropriate date 
        to designate as ``National Moonshot Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Moonshot Day'';
            (2) recognizes the vital importance of science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in planting the 
        seeds of inspiration and ambition in today's students so that 
        they further the Nation's history of dedication to scientific 
        advances with future Moonshot projects; and
            (3) encourages parents and educators across the country to 
        use ``National Moonshot Day'' as a day to inspire children to 
        think about the successes of the prior scientific achievements 
        and the challenges facing the Nation, and to make direct 
        connections between their classwork and potential for solutions 
        to the most pressing problems.
                                 <all>
