                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the increased risk of sleep apnea among soldiers returning 
    from active duty and the benefits of continuous positive airway 
 pressure (CPAP) therapy on treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in 
     soldiers suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Whereas 12 to 18 million people in the United States remain untreated for (OSA);
Whereas untreated OSA can lead to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 
        diabetes, and depression;
Whereas 54 percent of the patients with PTSD who underwent sleep studies at 
        Walter Reed National Military Medical Center were diagnosed with OSA;
Whereas 20 percent of soldiers will develop sleep apnea in their lifetime;
Whereas soldiers are 4 times more likely to develop sleep apnea than non-veteran 
        civilians;
Whereas studies show that 37 percent of soldiers showing symptoms for PTSD also 
        report symptoms of insufficient sleep;
Whereas veterans suffering from PTSD experience fewer nightmares when their OSA 
        is treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy; and
Whereas the lack of public awareness of the disease, poor sleep habits during 
        active duty, and the effects of PTSD among veterans that lead to poor 
        sleep leads to many undiagnosed, untreated, and severe cases: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports raising public awareness of sleep apnea, 
        especially for United States soldiers and veterans;
            (2) supports providing access to care for soldiers and 
        veterans with sleep illnesses such as obstructive sleep apnea 
        (OSA);
            (3) encourages all United States soldiers and veterans to 
        seek and maintain healthy sleep habits both during and after 
        active duty; and
            (4) further explores continuous positive airway pressure 
        (CPAP) as a viable treatment for OSA in patients with 
        Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
                                 <all>
