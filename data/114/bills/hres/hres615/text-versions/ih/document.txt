                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the Senate regarding the importance of selecting 
   a Supreme Court Justice, and urging the Senate to only consider a 
 nominee who will uphold the integrity of the Constitution in judicial 
                               decisions.

Whereas the sudden and tragic death of Justice Antonin Scalia on February 13, 
        2016, has left a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States;
Whereas the Supreme Court is vested by article III of the United States 
        Constitution with the judicial power of the United States, extending to 
        all cases arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, 
        and Treaties;
Whereas the appointment of Justices to the Supreme Court under article II, 
        section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, is a constitutional duty dually 
        shared by the President and by the United States Senate;
Whereas though it is the President's duty under the Constitution to nominate 
        appointees to the Supreme Court, the President is not entitled to 
        deference on the confirmation of those nominees;
Whereas the Senate shares with the President an equal duty in reviewing and 
        approving nominees to the Federal judiciary who will uphold the 
        integrity and structure of the Constitution and the laws of the United 
        States with consistency and integrity; and
Whereas it is of the utmost importance that the vacancy that is left by Justice 
        Scalia be filled with an individual who will uphold the Constitution, 
        free from political bias or ideology: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the Senate in its constitutional duty to vet 
        and approve any nominee to the Supreme Court put forward by the 
        President; and
            (2) urges that the Senate only consider a nominee who has 
        demonstrated a faithful adherence to the limits placed on 
        judicial power by the Constitution.
                                 <all>
