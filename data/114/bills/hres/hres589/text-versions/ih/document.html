  Establishing the Select Committee on Excessive Use of Police Force.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) This past year alone we have seen 7 different incidents 
        of the unjustified use of lethal and excessive force by police 
        officers against African-Americans:
                    (A) The death of Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old

                    (B) The death of Eric Garner, an unarmed 43-year-

                Department in New York on July 17, 2014.
                    (C) The death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old 
                unarmed teenager, by a member of the Ferguson Police 
                Department in Missouri on August 9, 2014.
                    (D) The death of Ezell Ford, an unarmed 25-year-old 
                mentally ill man by members of the Los Angeles Police 
                Department in California on August 11, 2014.
                    (E) The death of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old 
                teenager by a member of the Chicago Police Department 
                in Illinois on October 20, 2014.
                    (F) The death of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy by a 
                member of the Cleveland Division of Police in Ohio on 
                November 22, 2014.
                    (G) The death of Anthony Hill, a 27-year-old 
                unarmed Air Force veteran, by a member of the DeKalb 
                County Police Department in Georgia on March 6, 2015.
                    (H) The death of Nicholas Thomas, a 23-year-old 
                unarmed man, by a member of the Smyrna Police 
                Department in Georgia on March 24, 2015.
                    (I) The death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old 
                arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for 
                possession of an alleged illegal switchblade on April 
                12, 2015.
                    (J) The death of Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old 
                African-American woman found hanged in a jail cell in 
                Waller County, Texas, on July 13, 2015.
                    (K) The death of Jamar Clark, a 24-year-old unarmed 
                man, by a member of the Minneapolis Police Department 
                in Minnesota on November 16, 2015.
            (2) From 2011 to 2015, 28,500 complaints filed against 
        Chicago Police officers resulted in no discipline in a study 
        conducted by the Invisible Institute and the Mandel legal 
        clinic of the University of Chicago law school.
            (3) These incidents and countless others are not isolated 
        but reflect a pervasive pattern of racial bias in the use of 
        excessive force in communities of color.
            (4) It is the will of the Congress that a select committee 
        be formed to investigate these patterns of excessive use of 
        force in communities of color.
