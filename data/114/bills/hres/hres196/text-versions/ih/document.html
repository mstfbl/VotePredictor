                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning the recent terrorist attacks in Tunis that resulted in the 
                   tragic loss of 21 innocent lives.

Whereas, on March 18, 2015, 5 armed terrorists raided the National Bardo Museum 
        in Tunis, Tunisia, held visitors hostage, and murdered 19 tourists, 
        including nationals from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Spain, Australia, 
        Poland, and France, along with 2 Tunisian nationals;
Whereas at least 44 tourists were wounded in the attack and 2 victims later died 
        from injuries sustained;
Whereas 2 of the terrorists in the attack, Yassine Laabidi and Haten Khachnaoui, 
        were killed by Tunisian police forces as they freed all hostages;
Whereas Yassine Laabidi and Haten Khachnaoui allegedly trained at a jihadist 
        camp in Libya in December 2014;
Whereas Tunisian authorities claimed to have killed the alleged leader of the 
        attack, Lokman Abu Sakhra, on March 29, 2015;
Whereas multiple terror groups, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant 
        (ISIL) and Ifrikiya al Alam, have claimed credit for the attack and 
        praised the terrorists for targeting Westerners;
Whereas Tunisian officials allege that the militants were members of the Okba 
        Ibn Nafaa Brigade, an extremist group that has claimed responsibility 
        for multiple previous terrorist attacks in Tunisia;
Whereas the increase in anti-Westerner attacks in Northern Africa and the Middle 
        East remains of great concern;
Whereas the United States and Tunisia share a longstanding and beneficial 
        economic and political relationship spanning more than 200 years;
Whereas the United States and Tunisia share many core values, including respect 
        for human rights and the rule of law;
Whereas Tunisia is the Arab world's most successful democracy after the Arab 
        Spring and is an exemplary beacon of hope for other nations pursuing the 
        establishment of a democratic system;
Whereas a vibrant, stable, and prosperous democracy in Tunisia is in the 
        interest of the United States and would fuel both economic and 
        democratic development throughout the region; and
Whereas the United States is committed to providing assistance to Tunisia in 
        ongoing investigation efforts and supporting its quest for democracy: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Tunis that 
        resulted in the tragic loss of 21 innocent lives;
            (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by 
        this tragedy;
            (3) expresses solidarity with the people of Tunisia and 
        pays tribute to our shared values, ideals, and liberties;
            (4) encourages all Tunisians to unequivocally stand 
        together in opposition to extremism and violence of any kind;
            (5) supports the efforts of the Government of Tunisia to 
        ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported 
        these attacks are brought to justice;
            (6) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to work 
        with the Government of Tunisia to fight against violent 
        extremists; and
            (7) affirms the United States commitment to strengthening 
        our bilateral relationship and engaging in a strategic 
        partnership with Tunisia.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
