                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
     conditions for the United States becoming a signatory to any 
 international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions under the United 
            Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to, or 
other agreement regarding, the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change of 1992, at negotiations in Paris in December 2015, or 
thereafter, which would--
            (1) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse 
        gas emissions for the Annex I Parties, unless the protocol or 
        other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled 
        commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 
        Non-Annex I Parties within the same compliance period;
            (2) not ensure that all parties to the agreement reduce an 
        equal amount of greenhouse gas emissions at an equivalent rate 
        within the same compliance period;
            (3) result in serious harm to the economy of the United 
        States; and
            (4) not adequately protect United States intellectual 
        property rights.
                                 <all>
