   Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that public 
servants should be commended for their dedication and continued service 
 to the United States during Public Service Recognition Week, the week 
                       of May 3 through 9, 2015.

Whereas the week of May 3 through 9, 2015 has been designated as ``Public 
        Service Recognition Week'' to honor employees of the Federal Government 
        and State and local governments and members of the uniformed services;
Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an opportunity to recognize and 
        promote the important contributions of public servants and honor the 
        diverse men and women who meet the needs of the United States through 
        work at all levels of government and as members of the uniformed 
        services;
Whereas millions of individuals work in government service, and as members of 
        the uniformed services, in every State, county, and city across the 
        United States and in hundreds of cities abroad;
Whereas public service is a noble calling involving a variety of challenging and 
        rewarding professions;
Whereas the ability of the Federal Government and State and local governments to 
        be responsive, innovative, and effective depends on outstanding 
        performance of dedicated public servants;
Whereas the United States is a great and prosperous country, and public service 
        employees contribute significantly to that greatness and prosperity;
Whereas the United States benefits daily from the knowledge and skills of the 
        highly-trained individuals who work in public service;
Whereas public servants--

space to help improve knowledge on how the world changes;

    (13) improve and secure transportation systems;

    (15) assist veterans of the Armed Forces;

Whereas members of the uniformed services and civilian employees at all levels 
        of government make significant contributions to the general welfare of 
        the United States, and are on the front lines in the fight to defeat 
        terrorism and maintain homeland security;
Whereas public servants work in a professional manner to build relationships 
        with other countries and cultures in order to better represent the 
        interests and promote the ideals of the United States;
Whereas public servants alert Congress and the public to government waste, 
        fraud, and abuse, and of dangers to public health;
Whereas the individuals serving in the uniformed services, as well as the 
        skilled trade and craft employees of the Federal Government who provide 
        support to their efforts, are committed to doing their jobs regardless 
        of the circumstances, and contribute greatly to the security of the 
        United States and the world;
Whereas public servants have bravely fought in armed conflicts in the defense of 
        the United States and its ideals, and deserve the care and benefits they 
        have earned through their honorable service;
Whereas public servants have much to offer, as demonstrated by their expertise 
        and innovative ideas, and serve as examples by passing on institutional 
        knowledge to train the next generation of public servants; and
Whereas the week of May 3 through 9, 2015 marks the 31st anniversary of Public 
        Service Recognition Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Public Service 
        Recognition Week'';
            (2) commends public servants for their outstanding 
        contributions to this great country during Public Service 
        Recognition Week and throughout the year;
            (3) salutes government employees, and members of the 
        uniformed services, for their unyielding dedication to and 
        enthusiasm for public service;
            (4) honors government employees and members of the 
        uniformed services who have given their lives in service to 
        their country;
            (5) calls upon a new generation to consider a career in 
        public service as an honorable profession; and
            (6) encourages efforts to promote public service careers at
