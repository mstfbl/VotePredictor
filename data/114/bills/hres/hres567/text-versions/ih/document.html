                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing opposition to the European Commission interpretive notice 
regarding labeling Israeli products and goods manufactured in the West 
 Bank and other areas, as such actions undermine efforts to achieve a 
             negotiated Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

Whereas the United States supports a negotiated solution to the Israeli-
        Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, a democratic, Jewish State 
        of Israel and a viable, democratic, Palestinian state, living side-by-
        side in peace, security, and mutual recognition;
Whereas a true and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be 
        established through direct negotiations regarding outstanding issues 
        between Israel and the recognized leadership of the Palestinian people, 
        the Palestinian Authority;
Whereas a true and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians is in the 
        national security interests of the United States and necessary to ensure 
        the safety and security of Israel;
Whereas the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement has 
        called on the European Commission to go beyond labeling guidelines and 
        implement a ban on the import of products of Israeli companies that 
        operate in the West Bank and other areas;
Whereas politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment from, and sanctions 
        against Israel represent a concerted effort to extract concessions from 
        Israel outside of direct negotiations between the Israelis and 
        Palestinians, and undermines efforts to achieve a negotiated two-state 
        solution;
Whereas the United States has long opposed efforts to impose solutions to the 
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict outside of direct negotiations between the 
        two parties;
Whereas the United States has historically been at the forefront of combating 
        economic pressure against Israel and has enacted legislation to counter 
        both the Arab League Boycott of Israel and the BDS movement;
Whereas one-sided actions, such as singling out Israeli products, serves to 
        encourage and prompt consumers to boycott Israeli products and goods 
        manufactured in the West Bank and other areas;
Whereas U.S. law (Public Law 114-26) states that the United States should 
        discourage potential trading partners from adopting policies to limit 
        trade or investment relations with Israel when negotiating the 
        Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with European countries;
Whereas the United States and the European Union have historically worked in 
        coordination to bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; and
Whereas multiple United States State legislatures have enacted measures to 
        confront politically motivated acts of boycott, divestment from, and 
        sanctions against Israel including Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, South 
        Carolina, and New York: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses opposition to the European Commission 
        interpretive notice regarding labeling Israeli products and 
        goods manufactured in the West Bank and other areas, as such 
        actions undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated Israeli-
        Palestinian peace process;
            (2) opposes politically motivated acts of boycott, 
        divestment from, and sanctions against Israel or Israeli-
        controlled territory;
            (3) calls upon the European Commission, the Council of the 
        European Union, and the European Parliament to oppose any 
        boycott, divestment, or sanctions initiatives aimed at singling 
        out Israel, to refrain from actions counterproductive to 
        resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to work on 
        bringing the parties back to the negotiating table;
            (4) encourages European Union member states to exert 
        prudence in the implementation of the European Union labeling 
        guidelines;
            (5) urges the Administration to increase the use of its 
        voice, vote, and influence in international organizations and 
        other appropriate international forums to actively oppose 
        political motivated acts of boycott, divestment from, and 
        sanctions against Israel;
            (6) supports efforts by United States State legislatures to 
        enact measures that oppose politically motivated acts of 
        boycott, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel; and
            (7) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution 
        to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, a 
        democratic, Jewish State of Israel and a viable, democratic, 
        Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, and 
        mutual recognition.
