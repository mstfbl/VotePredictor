                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            December 3, 2015

Mr. Payne (for himself, Mr. Mullin, Mr. Buchanan, Mrs. Napolitano, and

            referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for health and wellness coaches and ``National 
             Health and Wellness Coach Recognition Week''.

Whereas, January 11, 2016, through January 17, 2016, is ``National Health and 
        Wellness Coach Recognition Week'';
Whereas lifestyle-related chronic diseases are at the heart of the current 
        health care crisis in the United States;
Whereas the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has deemed 
        chronic disease ``the public health challenge of the 21st century'';
Whereas decades of research have linked lifestyle factors, such as inactivity, 
        poor diet, tobacco smoking, and sustained stress, with increased risk 
        for major illnesses and death;
Whereas attempts to reduce these lifestyle-related chronic disease and costs 
        have proven to be financially unsustainable within a system that rewards 
        hospitalizations and invasive procedures;
Whereas incentives for interventions and technologies that achieve desired 
        outcomes such as outpatient care, risk management, patient support, and 
        health coaching should be encouraged;
Whereas a large gap exists between health care provider recommendations and 
        sustainable health-related behavior change;
Whereas health coaches are a new type of health care worker who serve as 
        wellness guides and supportive mentors that motivate individuals to 
        cultivate positive health choices and move them toward those specific 
        goals;
Whereas health coaches serve a vital role in improving an individual's wellness 
        that complements and does not replace the work of health care 
        professionals; and
Whereas there are an increasing number of studies that show the effectiveness of 
        health and wellness coaches in improving individual health and wellness 
        and reducing health care costs: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Health and 
        Wellness Coach Recognition Week''; and
            (2) support the efforts of health and wellness coaches of 
        the United States on their important work to improve the health 
        and wellness of the Nation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
