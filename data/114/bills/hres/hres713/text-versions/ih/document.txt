                               RESOLUTION


 
     Honoring the vital role of small business and the passion of 
  entrepreneurs in the United States during ``National Small Business 
            Week'', beginning on May 1, through May 7, 2016.

Whereas this year marks the 53rd anniversary of ``National Small Business Week'' 
        and has been endorsed by every President since 1963;
Whereas approximately 28,000,000 small businesses in the United States, 
        comprising the leading force behind the United States economy, create 
        nearly 7 out of every 10 new jobs and generate close to 50 percent of 
        the Nation's nonfarm gross domestic product;
Whereas small firms account for 63 percent of the net new jobs created between 
        1993 and mid-2013, and 60 percent of the net new jobs created since the 
        end of the recession;
Whereas 22,000,000 small businesses are nonemployer sole proprietorship firms;
Whereas 3,700,000 veterans are small business owners and account for 9.1 percent 
        of all United States businesses;
Whereas the share of total businesses owned by women continues to increase, 
        currently including over 7,800,000 small businesses;
Whereas small businesses employ 48.5 percent of the country's private sector 
        workforce;
Whereas small businesses represent 37 percent of high-tech employment;
Whereas small businesses produce 16 times more patents per employee than large 
        patenting firms;
Whereas small businesses represent 98 percent of all exporters and produce 33 
        percent of exported goods;
Whereas, on July 30, 1953, Congress created the Small Business Administration to 
        aid, counsel, assist, and protect the interests of small businesses by 
        working to preserve free and competitive enterprise, to ensure that a 
        fair proportion of the total sales of government property are made to 
        small businesses, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of 
        the United States;
Whereas for more than 50 years, the Small Business Administration has helped 
        over 10,000,000 entrepreneurs reach the American dream of creating and 
        maintaining a small business, and has played a key role in fostering 
        local and national economic growth; and
Whereas the President has designated the week beginning on May 1, 2016, as 
        ``National Small Business Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the vital role of small business and 
        entrepreneurs in the United States during ``National Small 
        Business Week'';
            (2) supports the designation of ``National Small Business 
        Week'';
            (3) recognizes the important role of the Small Business 
        Administration as a valuable resource for the United States 
        entrepreneur;
            (4) supports and encourages young entrepreneurs to pursue 
        their passions and create more start-up businesses;
            (5) recognizes the importance of creating policies that 
        promote a business friendly environment for small business 
        owners free of unnecessary and burdensome regulations and red 
        tape;
            (6) recognizes the National Small Business Person of the 
        Year and the National Lender of the Year; and
            (7) supports efforts to--
                    (A) encourage consumers to shop locally; and
                    (B) increase awareness of the value of locally 
                owned small businesses and the impact of locally owned 
                small business on the economy of the United States.
