      Honoring in praise and remembrance the extraordinary life, 
   accomplishments, and countless contributions of Mr. Muhammad Ali.

Whereas, on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. Cassius Marcellus

        Lee Grady Clay;
Whereas, on March 6, 1964, after joining the Nation of Islam, Cassius Marcellus 
        Clay, Jr., became known as Muhammad Ali;
Whereas in 1954, Muhammad Ali's interest in boxing began at age 12, after he 
        reported a stolen bike to a local police officer, Joe Martin, who was 
        also a boxing trainer;
Whereas in 1959 Muhammad Ali was National Golden Gloves light heavyweight 
        champion and National Amateur Athletic Union champion;

        recipient in the Rome Olympics for light heavyweight boxing;
Whereas after winning his first 19 fights, including 15 knockouts, Muhammad Ali 
        defeated Sonny Liston on February 25, 1964, to become the world 
        heavyweight champion;
Whereas in 1967, Muhammad Ali refused induction into the U.S. Armed Forces due 
        to his strongly held religious beliefs and in doing so was arrested, 
        fined, stripped of his boxing license and title, and found guilty of 
        draft evasion;
Whereas in 1971, in Clay v. United States, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously 
        reversed the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision and overturned 
        Muhammad Ali's conviction;
Whereas Muhammad Ali would become the world heavyweight champion in 1964, 1974, 
        and 1978 making him the first fighter to capture the heavyweight title 
        three times;
Whereas Muhammad Ali retired from professional boxing in 1981 and dedicated his 
        life to promoting world peace, fighting for civil rights, hunger relief, 
        and basic human values;
Whereas Muhammad Ali's humanitarian work included helping to secure the release 
        of fifteen U.S. hostages held in Iraq during the first Gulf War, four 
        hostages held in Lebanon, and conducting goodwill missions to 
        Afghanistan and Cuba;
Whereas Muhammad Ali traveled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela following 
        his release from prison;

Whereas Muhammad Ali was presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 by 
        President George W. Bush;
Whereas, on December 17, 2005, Muhammad Ali was awarded the prestigious Otto 
        Hahn Peace Medal for his work with the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and 
        the United Nations; and
Whereas Muhammad Ali, ``The Greatest of All Time'', was not only a champion in 
        the boxing ring, but a champion of human and civil rights who, during a 
        difficult time in American history, stood on principle to end racism and 
        bigotry: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives does hereby honor the 
extraordinary life, accomplishments, and countless contributions to 
humanity made by Muhammad Ali.
                                 <all>
