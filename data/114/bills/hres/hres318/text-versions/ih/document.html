                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning resolutions or policies calling for or instituting a boycott 
of Israeli academic institutions or scholars by institutions of higher 
                  learning and scholarly associations.

Whereas the United States and the State of Israel enjoy an affinity and a 
        strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, friendship, and 
        respect;
Whereas the President signed the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act, 
        declaring Israel to be a Major Strategic Partner of the United States;
Whereas Israel's institutions of higher education have played a crucial role in 
        the significant global contributions made by the Jewish state in the 
        fields of science, medicine, and technology, as well as safeguarded 
        principles of academic freedom in providing a forum for the presentation 
        and debate of political and philosophical ideas, including discourse 
        that both supports and opposes the policies of Israel's Government;
Whereas academic exchanges between Israeli institutions of higher education and 
        institutions of higher education in the United States and around the 
        world redound to the greater benefit of those institutions and the 
        societies of which they are a part through exchange of ideas, sharing of 
        expertise, and providing exposure to diverse perspectives and 
        experiences;
Whereas the BDS (Boycott Divestment Sanctions) movement unfairly and 
        misleadingly singles Israel out for criticism and economic pressure, and 
        disregards the moral and legal responsibility of other parties to the 
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict;
Whereas the BDS movement seeks to draw institutions of higher learning and 
        scholarly associations into its damaging ambit by pressing for adoption 
        by such institutions and associations of resolutions or policies that 
        formally call for or establish the restriction of discourse, 
        cooperation, exchange, or any other involvement with Israeli academic 
        institutions and scholars;
Whereas resolutions or policies that would limit the freedom to teach, do 
        research in, or otherwise cooperate with academic institutions or 
        scholars from particular countries or regions are themselves contrary to 
        principles of academic freedom; and
Whereas the particular calls directed at boycott of Israeli academic 
        institutions and scholars are part of a campaign that hinders the 
        possibility of achieving a fair and just solution and a peaceful 
        settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and applies a double-
        standard to Israel by singling Israel out for boycott while ignoring the 
        myriad of nation-states whose human rights records fall well short of 
        Israel's: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns as contrary to principles of academic freedom 
        the adoption by any institution of higher education or 
        scholarly association of a resolution or policy that formally 
        calls for or establishes the restriction of discourse, 
        cooperation, exchange, or any other involvement with academic 
        institutions or scholars on the basis of the connection of such 
        institutions or such scholars to the State of Israel;
            (2) condemns any such resolution or policy by any 
        institution of higher education or scholarly association as 
        part of a campaign to hinder the possibility of achieving a 
        fair and just solution and a peaceful settlement to the 
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict;
            (3) praises the university presidents and institutions that 
        have opposed academic boycott and have shown dedication to the 
        free and open exchange of ideas; and
            (4) encourages institutions of higher education, both in 
        the United States and abroad, to enhance and accelerate their 
        engagement in academic exchanges with counterpart Israeli 
        institutions, including through missions, exchanges of visiting 
        professors, and joint research, and educational programs.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
