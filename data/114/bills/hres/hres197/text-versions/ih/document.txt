                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of April as ``Organ Donation 
                     Awareness/Donate Life Month''.

Whereas according to United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS), more than 116,000 
        people are waiting for organ transplants;
Whereas an average of 18 people awaiting transplants die each day due to the 
        severe shortage of donated organs;
Whereas every 10 minutes another name is added to the transplant waiting list;
Whereas one organ donor can save the lives of up to 8 people and improve the 
        lives of up to 50 people through tissue and cornea donation;
Whereas everyone should be encouraged to get the facts about donation and 
        discuss their wishes with their families;
Whereas the Department of Motor Vehicles plays a critical role in maintaining a 
        donor registry, with donors having registered when receiving their 
        driver's license or ID card, which are identified by the symbol of a red 
        heart;
Whereas State organ recovery agencies, health care professionals, volunteers, 
        educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
        private organizations hope to boost the numbers of organ, tissue, eye, 
        blood, bone marrow, and stem cell donors throughout the United States; 
        and
Whereas April would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Organ Donation 
        Awareness/Donate Life Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Organ Donation Awareness/Donate Life Month''.
