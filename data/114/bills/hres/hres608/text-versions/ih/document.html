Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of Lunar New Year 
                                in 2016.

Whereas Lunar New Year begins on the second new moon following the winter 
        solstice, or the first day of the new year according to the lunisolar 
        calendar, and extends until the full moon 15 days later;
Whereas the 15th day of the new year, according to the lunisolar calendar, is 
        called the Lantern Festival;
Whereas Lunar New Year is often referred to as ``Spring Festival'' in various 
        Asian countries;
Whereas many religious and ethnic communities use lunar-based calendars;
Whereas Lunar New Year began in China more than 4,000 years ago and is widely 
        celebrated in East and Southeast Asia;
Whereas the Asian diaspora has expanded the Lunar New Year celebration into an 
        annual worldwide event;
Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated by millions of Asian Americans, and by many 
        non-Asian Americans, in the United States;
Whereas Lunar New Year is celebrated with community activities and cultural 
        performances;
Whereas participants celebrating Lunar New Year travel to spend the holiday 
        reuniting with family and friends; and
Whereas Lunar New Year is traditionally a time to wish upon others good fortune, 
        health, prosperity, and happiness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the cultural and historical significance of 
        Lunar New Year;
            (2) in observance of this Lunar New Year, the Year of the 
        Monkey, expresses its deepest respect for Asian Americans and 
        all individuals throughout the world who celebrate this 
        significant occasion; and
            (3) wishes Asian Americans and all individuals who observe 
        this holiday a happy and prosperous new year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
