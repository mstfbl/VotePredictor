                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of May 8, 2016, through May 14, 
                 2016, as Food Allergy Awareness Week.

Whereas as many as 15,000,000 people in the United States, including nearly 
        6,000,000 children under the age of 18, have food allergies, which are 
        potentially life-threatening;
Whereas research shows that the prevalence of food allergy is increasing among 
        children;
Whereas there is no cure for food allergy and limited understanding of the 
        underlying reasons for the increase in prevalence of food allergies 
        among children;
Whereas 8 foods, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, soy, and 
        wheat, cause 90 percent of all food allergy reactions in the United 
        States;
Whereas strict avoidance of offending foods is the only way to prevent an 
        allergic reaction;
Whereas reactions typically occur when an individual unknowingly eats a food 
        containing an ingredient to which they are allergic;
Whereas the symptoms of a food-allergic reaction can include hives, vomiting, 
        respiratory distress, swelling of the throat, anaphylaxis, and death;
Whereas anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and 
        may cause death;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food 
        allergy results in more than 200,000 ambulatory care visits a year 
        involving children under age 18;
Whereas those with food allergies and parents of children with food allergies 
        develop plans for food allergy management that include prompt access to 
        epinephrine;
Whereas Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), a national, nonprofit 
        organization dedicated to improving the quality of life and the health 
        of individuals with food allergies, and to provide them hope through the 
        promise of new treatments, recognizes and supports Food Allergy 
        Awareness Week during May of every calendar year;
Whereas outreach and education to the public may improve the response to an 
        allergic reaction;
Whereas public awareness of food allergies may also enhance the commitment to 
        research to understand the causes for food allergies and interventions 
        for allergic reaction; and
Whereas this year Food Allergy Awareness Week is recognized during the week of 
        May 8, 2016, through May 14, 2016: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Food Allergy Awareness 
        Week;
            (2) encourages the President to issue a proclamation in 
        support of the goals and ideals of Food Allergy Awareness Week;
            (3) encourages States, territories, possessions of the 
        United States, and localities to support the goals and ideals 
        of Food Allergy Awareness Week;
            (4) encourages media organizations to participate in Food 
        Allergy Awareness Week and help educate the public about food 
        allergies;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms the Nation's commitment to 
        research the causes of food allergies, interventions for 
        allergic reactions, and the best way to prevent individuals 
        from having reactions; and
            (6) recognizes all people in the United States living with 
        food allergies, expresses gratitude to their family members and 
        friends who are a source of love and protection to them, and 
        salutes the health care professionals, teachers, and other 
        caregivers and medical researchers who provide assistance to 
        those so affected.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
