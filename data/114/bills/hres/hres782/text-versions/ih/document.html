                               RESOLUTION


 
  Encouraging the people of the United States to honor the service of 
 military retirees who continue to serve the United States long after 
             such retirees have completed military service.

Whereas there are 2,100,000 retirees of the Armed Forces of the United States 
        who have earned their retirement through career service or service-
        connected disability;
Whereas military retirees are dedicated, focused, well-trained, well-
        disciplined, and well-educated and bring the best qualities of United 
        States citizenship to lifelong service within the United States and 
        their local communities as stable, responsible, citizens, and neighbors;
Whereas those qualities often result in contributions to the civilian workforce 
        as experienced and dedicated employees, to local educational 
        institutions as teachers, counselors, and coaches, to local government 
        as elected public servants, and to communities as effective volunteer 
        leaders;
Whereas such dedication and focus brings balance and stability to local 
        communities; and
Whereas those contributions are the manifestation of the desire of military 
        retirees to continue lifelong service to the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives encourages the people 
of the United States to honor the past and continued service of 
military retirees to their communities and the United States long after 
such retirees have completed military service by supporting the goals 
and ideals of a ``Military Retiree Appreciation Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
