                               RESOLUTION


 
     Urging the Administration to work with North Atlantic Treaty 
 Organization member states to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic 
                Treaty in response to the Paris attacks.

Whereas terrorist attacks in Paris, France, killed an estimated 129 civilians at 
        7 different locations on November 13, 2015;
Whereas ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks and vowed to carry out 
        additional attacks against Western targets and North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) member states;
Whereas Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington, April 4, 
        1949, states that ``The Parties agree that an armed attack against one 
        or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack 
        against them all . . . .'';
Whereas France is a signatory of NATO and the November 13, 2015, attack 
        qualifies as an ``armed attack'' against a member country in Europe; and
Whereas NATO members, including France, invoked Article 5 less than 24 hours 
        after the September 11, 2001, attacks in solidarity with the people of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on the President 
to work closely with other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members 
to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in response to the 
Paris attacks.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
