                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran should 
immediately release the three United States citizens that it holds, as 
  well as provide all known information on any United States citizens 
               that have disappeared within its borders.

Whereas three United States citizens have been held captive in Iran, some of 
        them for multiple years;
Whereas one United States citizen disappeared in Iran over eight years ago; and
Whereas Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has stated that his government wishes 
        to engage in a constructive interaction with the world: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Iran should release all detained United States citizens immediately and 
provide any information it possesses regarding any United States 
citizens that have disappeared within its borders.
                                 <all>
