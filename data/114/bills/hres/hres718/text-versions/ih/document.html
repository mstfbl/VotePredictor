                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the 75th Anniversary of Flotilla 11-1, 8th District-Western 
                 Rivers Region, Coast Guard Auxiliary.

Whereas the Coast Guard Reserve and Auxiliary was created by Congress on June 
        23, 1939, and redesignated the Coast Guard Auxiliary on February 19, 
        1941;
Whereas the Coast Guard Auxiliary was created to support the Coast Guard in all 
        functions except military operations and law enforcement;
Whereas the Coast Guard Auxiliary is supported by 32,000 volunteers in 1,000 
        local units across the United States that provide over 2 million hours 
        per year helping to keep waterways safe;
Whereas Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 11-1 was established in 1941 in Afton, 
        Minnesota, is the oldest flotilla in the Coast Guard 8th District-
        Western Rivers Region, and is one of the longest existing flotilla units 
        in the entire Coast Guard Auxiliary;
Whereas Flotilla 11-1 is led by Flotilla Commander Jon D. Knutson and Vice 
        Flotilla Commander Erich John Hodurski and currently operates out of St. 
        Paul, Minnesota;
Whereas Flotilla 11-1 provides support and operates on the Minnesota River, the 
        Mississippi River, and the St. Croix River;
Whereas the volunteers of Flotilla 11-1 spend thousands of hours each year 
        conducting boater safety classes and no-cost boat safety checks, 
        verifying that all aids to navigation are in place and functioning, and 
        conducting environmental protection projects, safety patrols, and on-
        the-water response as necessary;
Whereas in August of 2007 volunteers of Flotilla 11-1 responded to the collapse 
        of the Interstate 35W Mississippi River Bridge and provided critical 
        ferry service to the scene of the collapse for local officials; and
Whereas Flotilla 11-1 monitors the marine emergency channel and responds to any 
        boaters in need of assistance, including for disabled boats and medical 
        emergencies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes Flotilla 11-
1, 8th District-Western Rivers Region, Coast Guard Auxiliary for 
celebrating its 75th anniversary and for the contributions it makes in 
supporting the local boating community in Minnesota.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
