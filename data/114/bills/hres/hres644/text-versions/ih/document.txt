                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the First Aero Squadron's 
   participation as the first aviation unit to take part in military 
   operations, and the group's contribution to the Nation's airpower 
                               heritage.

Whereas, on March 5, 1913, the United States formed the First Aero Squadron;
Whereas the pilots who made up this unit did not have formal flight training 
        classes, instead were typically self-taught or provided ground 
        instructions followed by individual practice;
Whereas in one instance a pilot received flight training and instruction through 
        mail correspondence with Orville Wright;
Whereas, on March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico, looting the 
        town and killing 18 people in the United States;
Whereas President Woodrow Wilson immediately directed General John J. Pershing 
        to pursue and disperse Pancho Villa in response to the raid on Columbus, 
        New Mexico;
Whereas, on March 10, 1916, Secretary of War Newton Baker ordered the use of the 
        First Aero Squadron in the pursuit of Pancho Villa;
Whereas, on March 15, 1916, the First Aero Squadron, under the command of 
        Captain Benjamin Foulois, arrived in Columbus, New Mexico;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron arrived with 8 Curtiss JN-3s, known as ``Jenny'' 
        series airplanes;
Whereas the Jenny was considered one of the most advanced aircraft built to 
        date, yet the airplane was still an extremely new technology that 
        experienced significant maintenance issues in flight and on the ground;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron was made up of 10 pilots, Capt. Benjamin 
        Foulois, Capt. Townsend Dodd, Lt. Joseph Carberry, Lt. Thomas Bowen, Lt. 
        Carleton Chapman, Lt. Herbert Dargue, Lt. Edgar Gorrell, Lt. Walter 
        Kilner, Lt. Ira Rader, and Lt. Robert Willis;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron upon arrival in Columbus, New Mexico, consisted 
        of 82 support soldiers, 8 JN-3 airplanes, 10 four-wheel drive motor 
        trucks, and 6 motorcycles;
Whereas Columbus, New Mexico, as a result of the First Aero Squadron's 
        deployment has come to be known as ``The Cradle of American Airpower'';
Whereas, on March 19, 1916, General Pershing called the First Aero Squadron to 
        the front lines in the fight against Pancho Villa's troops;
Whereas, on March 20, 1916, the First Aero Squadron flew the first combat 
        flights in United States military history;
Whereas from March 20, 1916, to April 20, 1916, Captain Foulois and his Squadron 
        flew hundreds of hours in support of General Pershing's operation 
        against Pancho Villa;
Whereas, on April 20, 1916, 4 of the JN-3s had crashed, 2 had been scrapped for 
        replacement parts, and the remaining 2 were inoperable due to mechanical 
        issues, as a result General Pershing ordered the First Aero Squadron 
        back to Columbus, New Mexico;
Whereas, on May 1, 1916, replacement airplanes, Curtiss R-2s, began to arrive in 
        Columbus, New Mexico, allowing the First Aero Squadron to resume flights 
        in support of General Pershing's efforts;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron received a total of 51 airplanes in Columbus, 
        New Mexico, to support the fight against Pancho Villa;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron continued combat and support flights until 
        General Pershing withdrew from Mexico in February 1917;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron went on to support United States military 
        operations in World War I and every major United States military 
        engagement since;
Whereas the First Aero Squadron, now known as the First Reconnaissance Squadron, 
        continues to operate in the United States Air Force; and
Whereas the First Aero Squadron's actions in 1916 formed the foundation of the 
        modern day United States Air Force: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the First Aero 
        Squadron becoming the United States first aviation unit to take 
        part in military operations;
            (2) celebrates the achievements of the First Aero Squadron 
        over the past 100 years; and
            (3) honors and expresses thanks to all United States Airmen 
        who fought in defense of the Nation in the 100 years since the 
        First Aero Squadron began operations.
