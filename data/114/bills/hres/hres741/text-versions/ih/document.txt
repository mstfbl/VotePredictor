                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the importance of nonprofit organizations to the economy of 
 the United States and expressing support for designation of September 
         as ``Nonprofit Organization (NPO) Recognition Month''.

Whereas an estimated 1,400,000 nonprofit organizations operate in the United 
        States;
Whereas the nonprofit sector continues to expand in size and scope;
Whereas nonprofits contribute nearly $1,000,000,000,000 to the United States 
        economy annually;
Whereas nonprofits serve a vital role in facilitating charitable giving and 
        social action;
Whereas the combined donations and volunteer hours of individuals to nonprofit 
        organizations are valued at hundreds of billions of dollars; and
Whereas September would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Nonprofit 
        Organization (NPO) Recognition Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of nonprofits to the 
        communities they serve, the issues they support, and the 
        economy of the United States; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``Nonprofit Organization 
        (NPO) Recognition Month''.
                                 <all>
