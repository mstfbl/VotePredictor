                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the importance of the United States-Republic of Korea-Japan 
  trilateral relationship to counter North Korean threats and nuclear 
    proliferation, and to ensure regional security and human rights.

Whereas, on January 6, 2016, North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test and 
        on February 6, 2016, North Korea conducted an Intercontinental Ballistic 
        Missile technology test, both constituting direct and egregious 
        violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions;
Whereas each of the governments of the United States, the Republic of Korea 
        (ROK), and Japan have condemned the recent tests, underscoring the 
        importance of a strong and united international response;
Whereas the ROK President Park Geun-hye and Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have 
        agreed to work with the United States both to institute strong measures 
        in reaction to North Korean provocations, and to prevent North Korea 
        from becoming a nuclear weapons state;
Whereas the United States, ROK, and Japan have signed a framework to enhance 
        information sharing called the ``Trilateral Information Sharing 
        Arrangement Concerning the Nuclear and Missile Threats Posed by North 
        Korea'';
Whereas Seoul, the capital of the Republic of Korea (ROK), is 35 miles from the 
        Demilitarized Zone, and Japan is 650 miles from North Korea, both within 
        reach of North Korea's weapons;
Whereas North Korea already has an estimated stockpile of nuclear material that 
        could be converted into 10-16 nuclear weapons, with clear intentions to 
        continue nuclear proliferation activities;
Whereas North Korea consistently conducts destabilizing domestic military 
        drills, including firing short range missiles into the territorial 
        waters of its neighbors;
Whereas United States Northern Command Admiral William Gortney has assessed on 
        October 5, 2015, that the North Koreans ``have the capability to reach 
        the [U.S.] homeland with a nuclear weapon from a rocket'' and U.S. 
        Forces Korea Commander General Curtis M. Scaparrotti said on October 24, 
        2014, that North Koreans ``have the capability to have miniaturized the 
        device [a nuclear warhead] at this point, and they have the technology 
        to potentially deliver what they say they have.'';
Whereas the ROK's indigenous missile defense capabilities are limited in their 
        ability to deter North Korea's threats, and would be greatly improved 
        with the United States deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area 
        Defense (THAAD) system;
Whereas the Report of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on human rights 
        in North Korea highlights that North Korea's own citizens are starved of 
        life's basic necessities and basic human rights;
Whereas the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has 
        established a field-based structure for assessing continued North Korean 
        human rights violations in Seoul, with the strong support of all three 
        governments; and
Whereas a strong United States-Republic of Korea-Japan trilateral relationship 
        is a stabilizing force for peace and security in the region, with 
        capabilities to combat future provocations from North Korea: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly condemns North Korea's nuclear tests, missile 
        launches, and continued provocations;
            (2) reaffirms the importance of the United States-Republic 
        of Korea-Japan trilateral relationship to counter North Korea's 
        destabilizing activities and nuclear proliferation, and to 
        bolster regional security;
            (3) supports joint military exercises and other efforts to 
        strengthen cooperation, improve defense capabilities, and 
        oppose regional threats like North Korea;
            (4) encourages the deployment and coordination of regional 
        advanced ballistic missile defense systems;
            (5) calls for the expansion of information and intelligence 
        sharing and sustained diplomatic cooperation between the United 
        States, ROK, and Japan; and
            (6) underscores the importance of the trilateral 
        relationship in tracking North Korea human rights violations 
        and holding it accountable for its abuses against its citizens 
        and the citizens of other countries.
