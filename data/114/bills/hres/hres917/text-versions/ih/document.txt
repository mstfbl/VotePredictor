                               RESOLUTION


 
      Congratulating The Optical Society on its 100th anniversary.

Whereas The Optical Society is the leading global professional association in 
        optics and photonics, supporting research and collaboration in the 
        science of light;
Whereas The Optical Society was founded in 1916 in Rochester, New York, as the 
        research catalyst for the science of light and has since become the 
        leading voice for advancing the study and application of optics and 
        photonics;
Whereas today, The Optical Society connects 270,000 scientists, students, 
        engineers, and business leaders around the world spanning 177 countries;
Whereas over the course of The Optical Society's 100-year history, 34 society 
        members have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, Chemistry, or 
        Physiology/Medicine;
Whereas optics and photonics is the science and application of light, serving as 
        the backbone for modern national security applications, industrial 
        controls, telecommunications, advanced manufacturing, health care, and 
        consumer and business products;
Whereas a 2012 National Research Council study, Optics and Photonics: Essential 
        Technologies for our Nation, outlined the utility of optics and 
        photonics and their role in facilitating economic growth, recognizing 
        their extraordinary impact on communications, information processing and 
        data storage, defense and national security, energy, health and 
        medicine, advanced manufacturing, and strategic materials;
Whereas Congress has recognized the importance of optics and photonics in the 
        House-passed Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 
        4435) and the Revitalize American Manufacturing Initiative (Public Law 
        113-235);
Whereas the United States Government has recognized the importance of photonics, 
        its contributions to economic development, and the benefits of public-
        private partnerships, by recently announcing a consortium working with 
        the Department of Defense that is known as the American Institute for 
        Manufacturing Integrated Photonics (AIM Photonics); and
Whereas optics and photonics create more than $3,000,000,000,000 in revenue 
        annually in the United States and support upwards of 7,400,000 jobs: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates The Optical Society on its 100th year 
        anniversary;
            (2) reaffirms the crucial role optics and photonics has 
        played over the last 100 years and continues to play in the 
        Nation's economy and everyday lives; and
            (3) recognizes the importance of continued investment in 
        fundamental optics and photonics research.
                                 <all>
