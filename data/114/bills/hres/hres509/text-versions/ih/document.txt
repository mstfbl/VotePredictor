                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the efforts of the Republic of Turkey, the 
   Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the Lebanese Republic to provide 
  housing, educational opportunities, health care, and other forms of 
 humanitarian assistance to individuals and families displaced by the 
                           conflict in Syria.

Whereas the Republic of Turkey and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan have 
        maintained an ``open door'' policy for all displaced Syrians without any 
        discrimination based on religious or ethnic origin, and Turkey has 
        reportedly dedicated $7,600,000,000 and Jordan has reportedly dedicated 
        $6,600,000,000 of their own resources to serve the housing, educational, 
        and health care needs of refugees, among other things;
Whereas the ongoing war in Syria has been among the most disruptive and costly 
        of this century, having displaced more than one-half of Syria's 
        population as of September 2015, including an estimated 4,100,000 
        refugees and an additional 7,600,000 internally displaced persons;
Whereas according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
        more than 1,700,000 Syrian refugees have been registered by the Republic 
        of Turkey, more than 1,000,000 Syrian refugees have been registered by 
        the Lebanese Republic, and more than 646,000 Syrian refugees have been 
        registered by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan;
Whereas Turkey is hosting nearly 265,000 Syrian refugees and Jordan is hosting 
        more than 112,000 Syrian refugees in camps where they are working to 
        provide food, health care, and educational services as well as 
        psychological assistance, vocational training, and social activities;
Whereas an additional 1,500,000 Syrian refugees are living in Turkey, an 
        additional 1,100,000 Syrian refugees are living in Lebanon, and an 
        additional 750,000 Syrians are living in Jordan, outside of refugee 
        camps and thus must live on the economies of the respective countries;
Whereas the governments of Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon are working to provide 
        services to the refugees living outside of camps, but are facing 
        significant strains on their public services, particularly health and 
        education;
Whereas well over 100,000 children have been born as refugees in Turkey, Jordan, 
        and Lebanon since the start of the conflict, and those that lack birth 
        registration are at risk of statelessness; and
Whereas Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon have made education a top priority for the 
        refugee children, with more than 208,000 Syrian students registered in 
        Turkish schools, including 78,000 Syrian students in 25 Turkish refugee 
        camps, over 120,000 Syrian students registered in Jordanian schools, 
        including 19,000 Syrian students in schools at the Za'atari Refugee 
        Camp, and more than 112,000 Syrian students registered in Lebanese 
        schools: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the leadership of the Republic of Turkey, the 
        Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and the Lebanese Republic in 
        providing refuge and assistance to the people and families 
        fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria, which has become the 
        most complex humanitarian crisis facing the international 
        community;
            (2) recognizes the strain that hosting such significant 
        numbers of refugees can place on public services, particularly 
        for education and health, and the need to mitigate the impact 
        of these stresses on host communities;
            (3) expresses deep sympathy to Syrian refugees and their 
        families for the loss of life, displacement, and massive 
        destruction produced by the regional conflict; and
            (4) condemns the loss of innocent civilian life during the 
        course of the conflict in Syria.
