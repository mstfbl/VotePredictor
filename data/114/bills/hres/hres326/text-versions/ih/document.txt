                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the need 
             to reduce the influence of money in politics.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. FULL DISCLOSURE AND REDUCING THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN 
              POLITICS.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election 
        Commission (558 U.S. 310) opened the door to the corrupting 
        influence of money in politics;
            (2) in order to restore the American people's faith in the 
        integrity of their elected government, Congress should have the 
        power to regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind 
        equivalents with respect to Federal elections, including 
        through regulating--
                    (A) the amount of contributions to candidates for 
                nomination or election to Federal office;
                    (B) the amount of expenditures that may be made by, 
                in support of, or in opposition to such candidates; and
                    (C) the content and integrity of such expenditures; 
                and
            (3) all political contributions should be publicly 
        disclosed, including those made to or by independent groups, so 
        that voters have complete information about who is paying for 
        political advertisements.
                                 <all>
