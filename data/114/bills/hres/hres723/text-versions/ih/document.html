                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the support of the House of Representatives for the 
designation of a National Day of Recognition for the centennial of the 
Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (for Canada) for 
       the Protection of Migratory Birds, and for other purposes.

Whereas the United States and Great Britain (on behalf of Canada), recognizing 
        the need to adopt an international agreement to protect and conserve 
        birds that migrate internationally, signed the Convention Between the 
        United States and Great Britain (for Canada) for the Protection of 
        Migratory Birds, also known as the Migratory Bird Treaty, on August 16, 
        1916;
Whereas this agreement served as the foundation for the passage of domestic 
        legislation to implement the commitment to protect migratory birds, such 
        as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), as well as 
        subsequent treaties with Mexico, Japan, and Russia;
Whereas many migratory bird species travel long distances and cross 
        international borders;
Whereas international cooperation provides countries--as well as Federal, State, 
        nongovernmental, and tribal partners--with the opportunity to unite in 
        protecting valuable wildlife species and to share knowledge regarding 
        migratory bird resources; and
Whereas migratory bird species have a significant impact on the United States 
        economy, as evidenced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service 
        estimates that $107,000,000,000 is spent on birdwatching equipment and 
        travel in the United States, and $1,800,000,000 is spent on migratory 
        bird hunting equipment and trips in the United States: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a National Day of 
        Recognition for the centennial of the Convention Between the 
        United States and Great Britain (for Canada) for the Protection 
        of Migratory Birds, also known as the Migratory Bird Treaty;
            (2) recognizes the significance of 100 years of migratory 
        bird protection efforts; and
            (3) encourages efforts to engage and educate the public 
        regarding migratory birdwatching and hunting.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
