                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
States Postal Service should issue a commemorative stamp commemorating 
 the 100th Anniversary of the purchase of the territories known as the 
                  Virgin Islands of the United States.

Whereas, on March 31, 2017, the Virgin Islands of the United States will 
        celebrate 100 years as a possession and part of the union of the United 
        States of America;
Whereas the United States of America purchased from Denmark for twenty-five 
        million ($25,000,000) U.S. dollars in gold the islands of the Danish 
        West Indies within the Caribbean Sea now known as the Virgin Islands of 
        the United States for geopolitical, military, and economic protection 
        and expansion of the United States interest in the Caribbean region;
Whereas such purchase was the culmination of a half-century of interest by the 
        United States of American with the Danish Government for the islands as 
        an easterly point to the United States, an important part to the region 
        having served as the hub of Western hemisphere commerce in the region 
        for several centuries, and serving a crucial role in naval military 
        activity in the Caribbean Basin;
Whereas the transfer of the Danish West Indies to the United States took place 
        on March 31, 1917, and is commemorated annually by holding ``Transfer 
        Day'' ceremonies in the Virgin Islands of the United States;
Whereas the people of the Virgin Islands of the United States include but are 
        not limited to the descendants of European immigrants, enslaved 
        Africans, native inhabitants, and people from other Caribbean islands, 
        South America, and the continental United States;
Whereas through the arts, politics, and intellectual discourse, though small in 
        size, the Virgin Islands of the United States continue to contribute and 
        positively participate in the rich fabric of the United States while 
        cherishing its unique and rich Caribbean history and culture;
Whereas the contribution of the Virgin Islands of the United States includes but 
        is not limited to serving as drafters, soldiers, and patriots of the new 
        Nation through notables such as Alexander Hamilton, leadership for both 
        sides of the great question of slavery and race in the new Nation, by 
        leading slave revolts through individuals such as Denmark Vesey and 
        acting as Secretary of the Treasury of the Confederate States in the 
        person of Judah Benjamin, serving as explorers and entrepreneurs of the 
        United States through United States Senator David Yulee of Florida and 
        one of the founders of San Francisco, William Leidesdorff;
Whereas, as the Virgin Islands of the United States enters its next century of 
        inclusion the great country, it will have continued relevance in the 
        region as issues of foreign investment, increasing levels in maritime 
        and information technology, and commerce grow in the region, and 
        Caribbean nations look to the Virgin Islands of the United States as the 
        physical example and influence in the region of American thought, 
        economic leadership, and sophistication;
Whereas the Virgin Islands of the United States will use this anniversary to 
        commemorate history, culture, and diversity;
Whereas Virgin Islanders have served the United States in every war and conflict 
        since the Revolutionary War and have contributed to every facet of 
        history and life of the United States;
Whereas 2017 marks the 100th anniversary of the Virgin Islands becoming a part 
        of the United States; and
Whereas issuing a postage stamp commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the 
        Virgin Islands becoming a part of the United States is fitting and 
        proper because today the territory is under the jurisdiction of the 
        president of the United States of America and residents are American 
        citizens: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Postmaster General should issue a commemorative 
        postage stamp commemorating the 100th Anniversary of the Virgin 
        Islands becoming a part of the United States; and
            (2) such stamp should--
                    (A) be issued in the denomination used for first-
                class mail up to 1 ounce in weight;
                    (B) bear such illustration or picture as the 
                Postmaster General determines; and
                    (C) be placed in sale at such time and for such 
                period as the Postmaster General determines.
                                 <all>
