                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the State of 
  Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian hostility and 
  that the House of Representatives pledges to support Israel in its 
                  efforts to maintain its sovereignty.

Whereas the State of Israel has been a loyal friend and ally of the United 
        States since its establishment in 1948;
Whereas, on September 9, 2015, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated that Israel ``. 
        . . will not see [the] next 25 years . . . Until then, struggling, 
        heroic and jihadi morale will leave no moment of serenity for 
        Zionists''; and
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a project of the Obama 
        Administration, was finalized on July 14, 2015, by the E3/EU+3 (China, 
        France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the 
        United States, with the High Representative of the European Union for 
        Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) and the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
        and substantially diminishes the security of Israel: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
        the State of Israel has the right to defend itself against 
        Iranian hostility; and
            (2) the House of Representatives pledges to support the 
        State of Israel in its efforts to maintain its sovereignty.
                                 <all>
