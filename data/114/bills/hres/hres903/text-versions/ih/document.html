_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the month of September 2016 
    as ``Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month'' in order to educate 
communities across the United States about sickle cell disease and the 
 need for research, early detection methods, effective treatments, and 
    preventative care programs with respect to sickle cell disease.

Whereas sickle cell disease (in this preamble referred to as ``SCD'') is an 
        inherited blood disorder that is a major health problem in the United 
        States and worldwide;
Whereas SCD causes the rapid destruction of sickle cells, which results in 
        multiple medical complications, including anemia, jaundice, gallstones, 
        strokes, restricted blood flow, damaged tissue in the liver, spleen, and 
        kidneys, and death;
Whereas SCD causes episodes of considerable pain in the arms, legs, chest, and 
        abdomen of an individual;
Whereas SCD affects an estimated 100,000 individuals in the United States;
Whereas approximately 1,000 babies are born with SCD each year in the United 
        States, with the disease occurring in approximately 1 in 365 newborn 
        African-American infants and 1 in 16,300 newborn Hispanic-American 
        infants and is found in individuals of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, 
        Asian, and Indian origin;
Whereas more than 3,000,000 individuals in the United States have the sickle 
        cell trait and 1 in 13 African-Americans carries the trait;
Whereas there is a 1 in 4 chance that a child born to parents who both have the 
        sickle cell trait will have the disease;
Whereas the life expectancy of an individual with SCD is often severely limited;
Whereas, while hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (commonly known as 
        ``HSCT'') is currently the only cure for SCD and advances in treating 
        the associated complications of SCD have occurred, more research is 
        needed to find widely available treatments and cures to help patients 
        with SCD; and
Whereas September 2016 has been designated as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness 
        Month in order to educate communities across the United States about 
        SCD, including early detection methods, effective treatments, and 
        preventative care programs with respect to SCD: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Sickle Cell Disease 
        Awareness Month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to hold 
        appropriate programs, events, and activities during Sickle Cell 
        Disease Awareness Month to raise public awareness of 
        preventative care programs, treatments, and other patient 
        services for those suffering from sickle cell disease.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
