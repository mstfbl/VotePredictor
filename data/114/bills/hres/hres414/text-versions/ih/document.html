                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of September 2015 as ``Campus 
                          Fire Safety Month''.

Whereas recent student-related housing fires in South Dakota, Pennsylvania, 
        Kentucky and other schools across the country have tragically cut short 
        the lives of some of the youth of our Nation;
Whereas since January 2000, at least 169 people, including students, parents, 
        and children have died in campus-related fires;
Whereas approximately 87 percent of these deaths have occurred in off-campus 
        occupancies;
Whereas a majority of the students across the Nation live in off-campus 
        occupancies;
Whereas a number of fatal fires have occurred in buildings where the fire safety 
        systems have been compromised or disabled by the occupants;
Whereas it is recognized that automatic fire alarm systems and smoke alarms 
        provide the necessary early warning to occupants and the fire department 
        of a fire so that appropriate action can be taken;
Whereas it is recognized that automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly 
        effective method of controlling or extinguishing a fire in its early 
        stages, protecting the lives of the building's occupants;
Whereas many students are living in off-campus occupancies, Greek housing, and 
        residence halls that are not adequately protected with automatic fire 
        sprinkler systems and automatic fire alarm systems or adequate smoke 
        alarms;
Whereas it is recognized that fire safety education is an effective method of 
        reducing the occurrence of fires and reducing the resulting loss of life 
        and property damage;
Whereas students are not routinely receiving effective fire safety education 
        throughout their entire college career;
Whereas it is vital to educate the future generation of our Nation about the 
        importance of fire safety behavior so that these behaviors can help to 
        ensure their safety during their college years and beyond; and
Whereas by developing a generation of fire-safe adults, future loss of life from 
        fires can be significantly reduced: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the establishment of ``Campus Fire Safety 
        Month'';
            (2) encourages schools and municipalities across the 
        country to provide educational programs to all students 
        throughout the school year; and
            (3) encourages schools and municipalities to evaluate the 
        level of fire safety being provided in both on- and off-campus 
        student housing and take the necessary steps to ensure fire-
        safe living environments through fire safety education, 
        installation of fire suppression and detection systems and 
        smoke alarms and the development and enforcement of applicable 
        codes relating to fire safety.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
