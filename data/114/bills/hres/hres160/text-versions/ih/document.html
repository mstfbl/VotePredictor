                               RESOLUTION


 
  Welcoming the Seventh Summit of the Americas, to be held in Panama 
           City, Panama, April 10, 2015, and April 11, 2015.

Whereas the United States is inexorably linked with the people and countries in 
        the Western Hemisphere by geography, culture, and economic 
        interdependency;
Whereas it is in the interest of the United States to support economic growth, 
        prosperity, stability, security, and democratic governance throughout 
        the Western Hemisphere;
Whereas the countries in the region are important trading partners for the 
        United States, and United States foreign direct investment in the 
        Americas continues to grow;
Whereas trade between the United States and the Western Hemisphere totaled $1.8 
        trillion in 2013, and resulted in a goods and services trade surplus of 
        $12 billion;
Whereas United States foreign direct investment in the hemisphere totaled $1.3 
        trillion in 2013, which was 12 percent higher than 2012;
Whereas since 1998, trade between the United States and the Latin America and 
        Caribbean region has grown at a faster rate than United States trade 
        with Asia and the European Union;
Whereas beginning with the First Summit of the Americas, held in Miami, Florida, 
        in 1994, the Summits have served as important fora for heads of states 
        in the Americas to discuss common policy issues, affirm shared values, 
        and commit to work collaboratively to address enduring and new 
        challenges in the hemisphere;
Whereas the Seventh Summit of the Americas will be held in Panama City, Panama, 
        April 10, 2015, and April 11, 2015, with a theme of ``Prosperity with 
        Equity: The Challenge of Cooperation in the Americas'', and heads of 
        states have committed to take action in the areas of education, health, 
        energy, environment, migration, security, citizen participation, and 
        democratic governance at the Summit; and
Whereas the Seventh Summit of the Americas will provide an open forum 
        specifically for civil society representatives, and the United States 
        has advocated for expanded opportunities for civil society groups to 
        participate throughout the Summit process: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) welcomes the Seventh Summit of the Americas to be held 
        in Panama City, Panama, April 10, 2015, and April 11, 2015;
            (2) believes the Seventh Summit of the Americas will be an 
        important multilateral forum for heads of state in the Western 
        Hemisphere to discuss common policy issues, work 
        collaboratively, and set achievable and measurable policy 
        goals;
            (3) encourages all countries in the Western Hemisphere to 
        commit to transparent democratic governance, free and open 
        markets, and basic human rights and to uphold the principles 
        enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter;
            (4) believes the Seventh Summit of the Americas provides a 
        forum for the United States to advance its interests in the 
        region, including--
                    (A) economic growth and opportunity;
                    (B) energy security, reliability and 
                diversification;
                    (C) strengthening effective institutions of 
                democratic governance;
                    (D) citizen security and social inclusion of 
                underserved populations, including indigenous and Afro-
                descendent populations; and
                    (E) combating threats from transnational criminal 
                organizations, terrorist organizations and other 
                organized criminal groups; and
            (5) urges heads of state to provide opportunities for all 
        civil society organizations to meaningfully engage and provide 
        input during events surrounding the Summit.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
