                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             June 24, 2016

  Mr. Rangel (for himself, Mr. Conyers, and Mr. Sam Johnson of Texas) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
                           on Foreign Affairs

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Calling on the United States Government to resume talks with the 
     Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the research, 
investigation, recovery, and identification of missing and unaccounted 
     members of the United States Armed Forces from the Korean War.

Whereas more than 36,000 members of the United States Armed Forces died and 
        nearly 103,000 were wounded during the Korean War, which began on June 
        25, 1950;
Whereas of the approximately 8,000 members of the United States Armed Forces who 
        remain unaccounted for from the Korean War, the remains of at least 
        5,300 Americans are believed to be in the Democratic People's Republic 
        of Korea (in this resolution referred to as ``North Korea'');
Whereas the United States and North Korea have a precedent of working together 
        on issues related to American prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/
        MIAs) from the Korean War;
Whereas North Korea has intermittently returned the remains of deceased members 
        of the United States Armed Forces found in North Korea, including 
        several thousand sets of remains in 1954, and varying numbers of remains 
        in 1990, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003;
Whereas United States operations in North Korea to recover the remains of 
        deceased members of the United States Armed Forces were suspended in 
        2005;
Whereas the remains of deceased members of the United States Armed Forces in 
        North Korea are being lost due to construction and development, the 
        passing of North Korean observers of United States plane crashes, and 
        inclement weather conditions;
Whereas North Korea has reported uncovering the remains of deceased members of 
        the United States Armed Forces in North Korea through agriculture and 
        construction projects as recently as 2016;
Whereas not all of the remains of Korean War veterans located at the National 
        Memorial Cemetery in Hawaii (The Punch Bowl) have been identified;
Whereas members of the Coalition of Families of Korean & Cold War POW/MIAs, the 
        National League of POW/MIA Families, the National Alliance of Families, 
        Rolling Thunder, the Korean War Veterans Association, the American 
        Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and thousands of families are 
        yearning and advocating for the accounting of their loved ones and 
        comrades in arms of the Korean War; and
Whereas the mission of the United States Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency 
        (DPAA) is to provide the fullest possible accounting of missing United 
        States personnel: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls upon the United 
States Government to resume talks with the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea to make substantial progress in the research, investigation, 
recovery, and identification of missing and unaccounted members of the 
United States Armed Forces from the Korean War.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
