H. RES. 215

     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
 comprehensive plan to reform our national energy policy must promote 
   the sustainable use of renewable and alternative energy sources; 
   increase our domestic refining capacity; promote conservation and 
increased energy efficiency; expand research and development, including 
    domestic onshore and offshore exploration; and enhance consumer 
                               education.

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
 comprehensive plan to reform our national energy policy must promote 
   the sustainable use of renewable and alternative energy sources; 
   increase our domestic refining capacity; promote conservation and 
increased energy efficiency; expand research and development, including 
    domestic onshore and offshore exploration; and enhance consumer 
                               education.

Whereas the United States consumes roughly an average of 19,050,000 barrels of 
        oil per day;
Whereas the global average of daily oil consumption stands at 92,000,000 barrels 
        of oil per day;
Whereas the United States total annual energy consumption is approximately 97.5 
        quadrillion BTU, with the global total annual energy consumption at 520 
        quadrillion BTU;
Whereas the United States has greatly increased domestic oil production over the 
        last decade leading to net imports of petroleum decreasing to 27 
        percent, the lowest number since 1985;
Whereas the United States has seen natural gas reserves and production exceed 
        all estimates and due to this is expected to be a net exporter of 
        natural gas by 2016;
Whereas the United States has abundant coal reserves, including a demonstrated 
        reserve base estimated to contain 480 billion short tons, and processes 
        such as gasification and liquefaction offer cleaner alternatives for 
        utilizing this resource;
Whereas renewable sources of energy account for 9.3 quadrillion BTU per year in 
        the United States; and
Whereas such sources such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, solar, 
        and wind need and deserve our attention and the necessary resources to 
        encourage their commercial viability: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
in order to meet our Nation's growing long-term energy demands and 
maintain our economic viability in the world marketplace, the following 
must be addressed in any comprehensive and economically viable energy 
bill considered by the 114th Congress:
            (1) Taking advantage of our abundant domestic coal supply.
            (2) Using recent technological innovations to exploit our 
        vast supply of natural gas.
            (3) Increasing our domestic oil production, infrastructure, 
        and refining capacity.
            (4) Expanding use of renewable and alternative energy 
        sources.
            (5) Exploring and investing in advanced nuclear reactor 
        technologies.
            (6) Reflecting the discoveries of light sweet crude in the 
        United States, which has exceeded what was predicted even 5 
        years ago, and evaluating the capacity and market for 
        extracting and refining this natural resource.
            (7) Promoting and providing incentives for an increase in 
        conservation and energy efficiency.
            (8) Expanding and promoting additional research and 
        development through new and innovative methods such as public-
        private partnerships.
            (9) Enhancing consumer awareness and education regarding 
        methods to increase energy efficiency and available alternative 
        fuel sources to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and 
        provide American energy security.
