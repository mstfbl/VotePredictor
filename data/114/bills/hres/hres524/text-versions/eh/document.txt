H. Res. 524

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                     November 17, 2015.
Whereas on Friday, November 13, 2015, three groups of Islamist terrorists 
        launched coordinated attacks against six sites across Paris, France, 
        resulting in the loss of at least 129 innocent lives and the severe 
        wounding of many hundreds;
Whereas the attacks on the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France, Le Petit 
        Cambodge restaurant, Le Belle Equipe bar, and on the Avenue de la 
        Republique in the 10th district, represent the largest terrorist attack 
        in Europe since the Madrid, Spain, train bombings of 2004;
Whereas American student Nohemi Gonzalez, 23, of El Monte, California, is among 
        the innocent lives lost in these terrorist attacks, with several 
        Americans injured;
Whereas French first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and 
        heroically, in one instance blocking entrance of a suicide bomber to the 
        Stade de France, doubtlessly saving dozens of lives;
Whereas seven terrorists were killed, most in suicide bombings and one in a 
        shoot-out with police, and French intelligence and law enforcement are 
        still pursuing those possibly connected to the attacks;
Whereas French President Francois Hollande vowed that ``we will fight, and we 
        will be ruthless'';
Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that the Alliance would 
        stand with France and remain ``strong and united'' against terrorism;
Whereas President Barack Obama stated, ``Once again we've seen an outrageous 
        attempt to terrorize innocent civilians. This attack is not just on 
        Paris * * * this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal 
        values that we share. We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever 
        assistance that the Government and the people of France need to 
        respond.'';
Whereas the so-called ``Islamic State of Iraq and Syria'' (ISIS) claimed 
        responsibility for the attack;
Whereas the precise coordination of these attacks at multiple sites across 
        Paris, along with the recent downing of a Russian airline in Egypt and 
        the double suicide bombing in a shopping district in Beirut--brutal 
        attacks also claimed by ISIS--indicates the planning, operational, and 
        logistical capabilities of ISIS appear to have advanced significantly, 
        and their focus now includes large scale external attacks;
Whereas the continued and enhanced coordination of law enforcement and 
        intelligence efforts amongst European countries is critical to 
        inhibiting the movement and support for ISIS-affiliated terrorist cells;
Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, law enforcement 
        engagement, and information sharing on emerging threats and identified 
        Islamist extremists greatly improves security for the people of the 
        United States, Europe, and our allies around the world;
Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Paris strengthens our resolve to defeat 
        ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which pose a growing threat to 
        international peace and stability;
Whereas France is an indispensable ally in our joint coalition efforts to defeat 
        ISIS;
Whereas France has long been an ally and friend to the United States since the 
        birth of our Nation, throughout the major conflicts of the 20th century, 
        and has provided significant assistance to key United States strategic 
        priorities such as combating terrorism in northern Africa; and
Whereas we stand in solidarity with our French allies in their time of national 
        mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice all those 
        involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as 
        identifying and thwarting any planning to undertake similar assaults in 
        the future: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Paris, 
        France, on November 13, 2015, that resulted in the loss of at least 129 
        lives;
            (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends of those 
        individuals who were killed in the attacks and expresses its sympathies 
        to those individuals who have been injured;
            (3) supports the Government of France in its efforts to bring to 
        justice all those involved with the planning and execution of these 
        terrorist attacks;
            (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and 
        from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by 
        these individuals upon their return to their local communities; and
            (5) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and people of 
        France to respond to the growing terrorist threat posed by the Islamic 
        State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its terrorist affiliates.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
