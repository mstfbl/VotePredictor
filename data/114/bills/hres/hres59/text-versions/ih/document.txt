                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the National Construction Equipment Museum established, 
   operated and maintained by the Historical Construction Equipment 
      Association located in Bowling Green, Ohio, as the National 
                     Construction Equipment Museum.

Whereas the Historical Construction Equipment Association, located in Bowling 
        Green, Ohio, was incorporated in 1987 and organized as a not-for-profit 
        organization in the State of Ohio and is recognized as a 501(c)(3) 
        charitable educational organization by the Internal Revenue Service;
Whereas the Historical Construction Equipment Association is recognized as an 
        official archive of the national construction equipment industry;
Whereas the Historical Construction Equipment Association is devoted to 
        preserving for public education the history of all types of 
        construction, surface mining, and dredging equipment and established the 
        National Construction Equipment Museum in furtherance of this purpose;
Whereas the National Construction Equipment Museum has an extensive collection 
        of restored, historically significant equipment in operating condition 
        for public tours and demonstrations;
Whereas the National Construction Equipment Museum seeks to educate a diverse 
        audience through exceptional exhibits that document the importance of 
        this equipment and these industries in building the Nation's 
        infrastructure while also raising job and career awareness in these 
        fields; and
Whereas the National Construction Equipment Museum is a destination attraction, 
        located in northwest Ohio, an area which has a long history of equipment 
        manufacturing, and is the only public museum of its kind in the Nation: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the National 
Construction Equipment Museum established, operated and maintained by 
the Historical Construction Equipment Association located in Bowling 
Green, Ohio, as the National Construction Equipment Museum.
