                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that veterans 
    deserve the health and living standards they fought to protect.

Whereas it is an honor and privilege to serve one's country;
Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States protect the rights and freedoms of 
        the people of the United States;
Whereas there are 21,000,000 veterans living in the United States who served in 
        World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, Persian 
        Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or 
        Operation New Dawn;
Whereas veterans often become homeless due to war-related disabilities, 
        including physical and mental disabilities;
Whereas difficulties readjusting to civilian life can lead to veterans becoming 
        homeless;
Whereas in 2013, nearly 14 percent of the more than 260,000 veterans served by 
        the homelessness programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs served 
        in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation 
        New Dawn;
Whereas on a single night in January 2014, 49,993 veterans were homeless;
Whereas about 10 percent of the adult homeless population are veterans; and
Whereas a stable home leads to better health, education, social, and employment 
        outcomes for anyone: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) acknowledges the general welfare and security of the 
        United States and the health and living standards of its people 
        are protected by the brave men and women that make up the 
        United States Armed Forces;
            (2) calls on the people of the United States not to ignore 
        those veterans returning to the United States who are unable to 
        maintain the proper health and living standards that they 
        themselves fought to protect for millions of others;
            (3) recognizes that finding every single American veteran a 
        home is not only the right thing to do, but also a vital and 
        necessary step towards repaying the unpayable debt that each 
        and every United States citizen owes to the men and women of 
        the Armed Forces who risk their lives for their country;
            (4) recognizes that the debt to these members of the Armed 
        Forces requires the realization, as soon as feasible, of a 
        decent home and a suitable living environment; and
            (5) remains committed to ending veteran homelessness once 
        and for all.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
