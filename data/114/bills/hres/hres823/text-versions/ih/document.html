                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Istanbul, 
  Turkey, on June 28, 2016, that resulted in the loss of at least 44 
                                 lives.

Whereas, on June 28, 2016, suicide bombers attacked the Ataturk International 
        Airport in Istanbul Turkey, opened fire and detonated explosives, 
        resulting in the loss of at least 44 innocent lives and severely 
        wounding over 200, including an American citizen;
Whereas Turkish first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and 
        heroically, caring for the wounded and taking immediate actions to 
        prevent subsequent attacks and further loss of innocent life;
Whereas the White House issued a statement condemning the attack ``in the 
        strongest possible terms'' and states that ``We remain steadfast in our 
        support for Turkey, our NATO Ally and partner, along with all of our 
        friends and allies around the world, as we continue to confront the 
        threat of terrorism'';
Whereas the Government of Turkey has stated militants from the Islamic State of 
        Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are responsible for the attack, and this attack 
        resembles those carried out by ISIS in other parts of the world;
Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Istanbul strengthens our shared resolve to 
        defeat ISIS and its terrorist affiliates, which pose a growing threat to 
        international peace and stability;
Whereas Turkey is a longstanding member of NATO and has played a crucial role in 
        transatlantic security since joining the alliance more than half a 
        century ago; and
Whereas we stand in solidarity with the people of Turkey in their time of 
        national mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice 
        all those involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as 
        well as identifying and disrupting any plans to undertake similar 
        assaults in the future: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks 
        in Istanbul, Turkey, on June 28, 2016, that resulted in the 
        loss of at least 44 lives;
            (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends 
        of those individuals who were killed in the attacks and 
        expresses its sympathies to those individuals who have been 
        injured;
            (3) supports efforts to bring to justice those involved 
        with the planning and execution of these terrorist attacks; and
            (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
        (ISIS) poses a fundamental security threat to the United States 
        and our allies.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
