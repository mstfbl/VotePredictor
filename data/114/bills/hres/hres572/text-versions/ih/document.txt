                               RESOLUTION


 
 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Texas Western College's 1966 
NCAA Basketball Championship and recognizing the groundbreaking impact 
 of the title game victory on diversity in sports and civil rights in 
                           the United States.

Whereas, on March 19, 1966, Texas Western College (the ``Miners'') defeated the 
        University of Kentucky in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
        (``NCAA'') men's college basketball final at Cole Field House in College 
        Park, Maryland, by a score of 72-65;
Whereas the 1966 Miners are still the only team from the State of Texas to win a 
        NCAA Basketball Championship;
Whereas this marked the first time an all-Black starting lineup had won the NCAA 
        Basketball Championship;
Whereas after the 1966 championship, many college teams throughout the South 
        following the Miners' example began recruiting Black athletes, ending 
        years of segregation;
Whereas immediately after the championship, between the years of 1966 and 1985, 
        the average number of Black players on college teams nearly doubled;
Whereas every southern conference team (including the Southeastern Conference) 
        followed the Miners' example, and all basketball teams were integrated 
        the following season;
Whereas the top-ranked University of Kentucky men's basketball team was favored 
        in the final over the third-ranked Texas Western College squad;
Whereas Texas Western College was led by coach Don Haskins and the University of 
        Kentucky by coach Adolph Rupp;
Whereas Coash Haskins taught his team the ``swinging gate'' defensive style he 
        had learned as a player at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College 
        (now Oklahoma State University) under legendary coach Henry Iba;
Whereas the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team of Bobby Joe Hill 
        (Detroit, Michigan), Orsten Artis (Gary, Indiana), Togo Railey (El Paso, 
        Texas), Willie Worsley (New York, New York), David Palacio (El Paso, 
        Texas), Dick Myers (Peabody, Kansas), Harry Flournoy (Gary, Indiana), 
        Louis Baudoin (Albuquerque, New Mexico), Nevil Shed (New York, New 
        York), Jerry Armstrong (Eagleville, Missouri), Willie Cager (New York, 
        New York), and David ``Big Daddy'' Lattin (Houston, Texas) finished the 
        basketball season 28-1; and
Whereas the Texas Western College's journey to the 1966 NCAA championship was 
        depicted in the 2006 film titled ``Glory Road'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives celebrates the 50th 
anniversary of the Texas Western College's 1966 NCAA Basketball 
Championship and recognizes the groundbreaking impact of the title game 
victory on diversity in sports and civil rights in the United States.
