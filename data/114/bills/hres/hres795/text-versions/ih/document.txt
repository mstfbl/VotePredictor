       Recognizing the 70th Anniversary of the Fulbright Program.

Whereas August 1, 2016, marks the 70th anniversary of President Harry S. Truman 
        signing into law the Fulbright Act of 1946;
Whereas the Fulbright Program was established by Senator James William Fulbright 
        of Arkansas for the ``promotion of international good will through the 
        exchange of students in the fields of education, culture, and science'';
Whereas the Fulbright Program is sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and 
        Cultural Affairs of the Department of State;
Whereas the Fulbright Program provides approximately 8,000 grants annually and 
        currently operates in over 160 countries, including 50 that have 
        established cost-sharing binational commissions;
Whereas 1,300 United States higher education institutions, both public and 
        private, host students at home and send scholars abroad;
Whereas current Fulbright students and scholars hail from all 50 States and 2 
        United States territories, and approximately a quarter are from minority 
        or underrepresented populations;
Whereas more than 370,000 persons from across the globe have benefited from this 
        unique opportunity;
Whereas alumni of the Fulbright Program include 54 Nobel Prize laureates, 82 
        recipients of the Pulitzer Prize, 33 heads of state, 16 Presidential 
        Medal of Freedom recipients, 8 members of the United States Congress, 
        and a former Secretary-General of the United Nations;
Whereas, on April 21, 2016, an American Elm was planted on the Capitol grounds 
        in recognition of the 70th anniversary of the Fulbright Program; and
Whereas the Fulbright Program promotes United States higher education abroad and 
        remains a valuable diplomatic tool: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the founding of the 
        Fulbright Program;
            (2) encourages the President and the Secretary of State to 
        work with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to 
        support the work of the Fulbright Program;
            (3) congratulates all recipients of Fulbright awards, both 
        past and present; and
            (4) calls on students, scholars, and professionals around 
        the world to seek out opportunities to engage with each other 
        and promote international good will.
