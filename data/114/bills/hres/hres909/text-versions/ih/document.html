                               RESOLUTION


 
          Expressing support for the right to rescue animals.

Whereas Congress believes in protecting the welfare and humane treatment of 
        animals;
Whereas every year, thousands of animals succumb to heatstroke in hot and 
        unattended vehicles;
Whereas these tragic incidents are almost always accidental, as pet owners 
        underestimate how long they will be away from their vehicles and how 
        quickly the temperature will rise inside the vehicle;
Whereas temperatures as low as 72 degrees Fahrenheit can result in temperatures 
        inside a car of up to 116 degrees Fahrenheit within an hour;
Whereas first responders face many competing demands and may be unable to reach 
        an animal in distress quickly enough to rescue it;
Whereas individuals who notice animals in danger in unattended vehicles are 
        hesitant or unable to act due to criminal or civil liability;
Whereas Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wisconsin have 
        passed laws that provide legal immunity to Good Samaritans who rescue 
        animals in unattended vehicles;
Whereas this week, on September 24, 2016, California became the seventh State to 
        do so when Governor Brown signed into law the Right to Rescue Act, 
        Assembly Bill 797, which passed unanimously in the State legislature;
Whereas there are serious efforts to pass legislation to encourage intervention 
        for animals trapped in unattended vehicles in at least fourteen 
        additional States; and
Whereas ``right to rescue'' legislation is a commonsense solution to allow 
        concerned individuals to rescue animals in imminent danger: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the overall safety, welfare, and humane 
        treatment of animals;
            (2) supports Good Samaritans who exercise their ``right to 
        rescue'' animals in imminent danger in unattended vehicles;
            (3) supports State legislation and other efforts to 
        protecting such Good Samaritans from criminal and civil 
        liability; and
            (4) supports initiatives and efforts to prevent and raise 
        awareness of the danger of leaving animals in unattended 
        vehicles.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
