                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that all students 
  should have access to the digital tools necessary to further their 
           education and compete in the 21st century economy.

Whereas the United States should lead the world in providing high-quality 
        education and opportunities to its citizens;
Whereas digital skills are essential for education and preparing citizens for 
        the economy of the future;
Whereas, on a daily basis, teachers across the country assign homework that 
        requires Internet access to be completed;
Whereas there are 5,000,000 households with school-age children in the United 
        States that do not have high-speed Internet access at home and fall into 
        what is known as the ``homework gap'';
Whereas a disproportionate number of students without high-speed Internet access 
        at home reside in low-income and minority households;
Whereas students and families in rural areas face additional challenges when 
        homework requires Internet access that is out of reach;
Whereas every student deserves an opportunity at 21st century success;
Whereas participation in the classroom can be improved when all students are 
        equipped with the tools to complete their homework;
Whereas educators can increase the use of cutting-edge education technology and 
        digital learning resources when those resources remain accessible during 
        out-of-school hours;
Whereas data show that students have received lower grades and been unable to 
        complete their assignments because of their lack of Internet access at 
        home;
Whereas improved student access to postsecondary education and workforce 
        opportunities can be made possible by increasing the ability of students 
        to apply for employment, postsecondary education, and financial aid 
        opportunities;
Whereas leaders in the public and private sectors have recognized that the 
        homework gap is an issue of national importance and partnered to find 
        cooperative solutions to address it; and
Whereas instilling digital skills and the knowledge to succeed in the 21st 
        century economy in the Nation's students is vital to the Nation's global 
        competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
all students should have access to the digital tools necessary to 
further their education and compete in the 21st century economy.
                                 <all>
