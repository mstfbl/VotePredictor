                               RESOLUTION


 
 Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that a 
 standing committee (or subcommittee thereof) hearing be held whenever 
 there is a moment of silence in the House for a tragedy involving gun 
                               violence.

    Resolved, That rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
is amended by adding at the end the following new clause:
``Hearings related to moments of silence
    ``7. Whenever a moment of silence related to a tragedy in the 
United States or its territories involving gun violence occurs on the 
floor of the House, the Speaker shall announce on the next legislative 
day the standing committee (or subcommittee thereof) designated to hold 
a hearing on such event. Such hearing shall occur within ten 
legislative days of the day of the moment of silence. If the chair of 
the designated committee or subcommittee does not call the requested 
hearing within three calendar days of the Speaker's announcement, a 
majority of the members of the committee or subcommittee may file in 
the offices of the committee or subcommittee their written notice that 
a hearing of the committee or subcommittee will be held. The written 
notice shall specify the date and hour of the hearing. The committee or 
subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately upon the 
filing of the notice, the clerk of the committee or subcommittee shall 
notify all members of the committee or subcommittee that such hearing 
will be held and inform them of its date and hour. Such notice shall 
also be made publicly available in electronic form and shall be deemed 
to satisfy paragraph (g)(3)(A)(i) of clause 2 of this rule. Only the 
event that was the subject of the moment of silence may be considered 
at that hearing.''.
