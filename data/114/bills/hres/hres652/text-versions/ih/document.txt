                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, Washington, as the 
              National Nordic Museum of the United States.

Whereas Nordic peoples have long contributed to the rich cultural heritage of 
        the United States;
Whereas Seattle has an undeniable connection to Scandinavia, hosting a 
        population with strong Nordic roots;
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum is dedicated to preserving and celebrating an 
        immigrant culture critical not only to the founding of Washington State, 
        but also of the United States; and
Whereas the Nordic Heritage Museum is the only museum in the United States to 
        honor the legacy of immigrants from the five Nordic countries of 
        Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the Nordic 
Heritage Museum as the National Nordic Museum of the United States.
