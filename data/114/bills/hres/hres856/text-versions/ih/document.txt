                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week of September 12, 2016, 
       through September 18, 2016, as ``Balance Awareness Week''.

Whereas vestibular (inner-ear-balance) disorders are underdiagnosed and 
        undertreated;
Whereas as many as 35 percent of adults 40 years of age and older in the United 
        States, approximately 69,000,000 people in the United States, have 
        experienced some form of vestibular dysfunction;
Whereas 80 percent of people 65 years of age and older have experienced 
        dizziness;
Whereas vestibular disorder patients may consult four or more physicians and 
        spend 50 months or more in their search for a diagnosis;
Whereas the Vestibular Disorders Association celebrates ``Balance Awareness 
        Week'' to reduce the time it takes to diagnose a vestibular disorder by 
        helping patients recognize their symptoms and encouraging them to seek 
        help from a qualified vestibular specialist; and
Whereas the week of September 12, 2016, through September 18, 2016, would be an 
        appropriate week to designate as ``Balance Awareness Week: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Balance Awareness Week''; 
        and
            (2) recognizes the importance of raising public awareness 
        about vestibular disorders.
                                 <all>
