                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing that Hillary Rodham Clinton violated, ignored, and 
    otherwise chose not to follow legal and ethical obligations and 
  responsibilities expected of the head of any Federal agency of the 
 United States Government during her tenure as United States Secretary 
                    of State from 2009 through 2013.

Whereas Congress finds that Secretary Clinton negligently commissioned the use 
        of a personal email system, with several personal servers, to conduct 
        official business during her time as Secretary of State;
Whereas Secretary Clinton elected not to use a Government email account or even 
        a commercial email account and was thereby able to circumvent the 
        automatic archiving of her emails;
Whereas Secretary Clinton, at the end of her tenure as Secretary of State in 
        January 2013, failed to make and preserve adequate records and 
        documentation relating to her tenure at the Department of State, as 
        chapter 31 of title 44, United States Code (commonly referred to as the 
        ``Federal Records Act'') requires the head of each Federal agency to do;
Whereas more than 100 emails in multiple email chains obtained from Secretary 
        Clinton's email server contained information that was determined to be 
        classified;
Whereas Secretary Clinton only returned a portion of her work-related email to 
        the Department of State for purposes of investigation in December 2014, 
        with the FBI later discovering several thousand additional work-related 
        emails;
Whereas the FBI determined Secretary Clinton and her staff were ``extremely 
        careless'' in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified 
        information;
Whereas the FBI found evidence to support the notion that any reasonable person 
        in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those Government 
        employees with whom she was corresponding about the matters contained in 
        particular emails, should have known that an unclassified system was not 
        the appropriate avenue for these types of conversations;
Whereas Secretary Clinton's emails were housed on unclassified personal servers 
        that were not even supported by full-time security staff, such as those 
        found at Federal agencies of the United States Government;
Whereas Secretary Clinton's unsecure, unclassified personal server made her 
        correspondence containing classified information susceptible to hostile 
        foreign actors and was potentially hacked by such actors;
Whereas Secretary Clinton chose to use her personal server to send emails while 
        outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related 
        emails in the territories of sophisticated adversaries;
Whereas the FBI assessed that hostile actors gained access to the private 
        commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in 
        regular contact from her personal account, due to her choosing to 
        correspond from an unsecure personal server; and
Whereas despite Secretary Clinton's repeated assertion that she never sent 
        emails that were marked ``classified'', Government officials who handle 
        classified information are expected to know that if the subject matter 
        contained in their emails is of a classified nature, whether marked or 
        unmarked, they are still obligated to protect such information: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives finds that, as the 
United States Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton failed to meet 
minimum standards of care with respect to the handling of classified 
and sensitive material.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
