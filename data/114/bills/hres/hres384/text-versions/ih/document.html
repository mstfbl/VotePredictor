                               RESOLUTION


 
              Calling for a formal end of the Korean War.

Whereas the Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, and active combat ceased with 
        the Armistice Agreement signed on July 27, 1953;
Whereas the Armistice Agreement did not formally end the war, so the Korean War 
        remains one of the world's longest ongoing armed conflicts;
Whereas the Korean War was a global conflict that involved not only South Korea 
        and North Korea, but also the United States along with more than 20 
        other nations, which altogether suffered hundreds of thousands 
        casualties and losses, including millions of civilians killed and 
        wounded;
Whereas 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's independence after Imperial 
        Japan surrendered to the United States during World War II on August 15, 
        1945; and
Whereas peaceful unification of Korea is desired by all Korean people: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) pays tribute to the sacrifices of the Veterans of the 
        Korean War, its victims and divided families; and
            (2) calls upon the international community to support the 
        vision of a unified Korea and assist efforts to promote 
        international peace and security, denuclearization, economic 
        prosperity, human rights, and the rule of law both on the 
        Korean Peninsula and elsewhere.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
