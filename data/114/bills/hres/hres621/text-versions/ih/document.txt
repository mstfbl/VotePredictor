                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
                      future of the Supreme Court.

Whereas the Administration of President Barack Obama has been one of the most 
        divisive Presidencies in American history;
Whereas the election of 2016 will be a historic election that will shape the 
        future for generations to come;
Whereas Justice Antonin Scalia was a critical force on the United States Supreme 
        Court in defending the Constitution;
Whereas the Founding Fathers endowed the Supreme Court with power to strictly 
        interpret the law within the bounds of the Constitution, never intending 
        for Judges to write, change, or create laws; and
Whereas the Founding Fathers established a series of checks and balances with 
        the spirit and understanding that a limited government is the best form 
        of governance: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its firm disapproval of the confirmation of 
        any liberal Justices to the United States Supreme Court 
        nominated by President Barack Obama; and
            (2) urges the Senate to hold any nomination to the United 
        States Supreme Court until the American people have a chance to 
        speak in the next Presidential election.
                                 <all>
