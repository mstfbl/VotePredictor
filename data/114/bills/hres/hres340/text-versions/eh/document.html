    Resolved, That the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 1735) entitled ``An 
Act to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of 
the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities 
of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such 
fiscal year, and for other purposes.'', in the opinion of this House, 
contravenes the first clause of the seventh section of the first article of the

this House and that such bill, with the Senate amendment thereto, shall be 
respectfully returned to the Senate with a message communicating this 
resolution.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
