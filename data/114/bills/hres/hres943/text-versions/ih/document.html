                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Hawaii 
  Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park in the State of 
 Hawaii, and expressing support for designation of August 1, 2016, as 
         ``Hawaii Volcanoes and Haleakala National Parks Day''.

Whereas the Hawaii National Park was established by section 1 of the Act 
        entitled ``An Act to establish a national park in the Territory of 
        Hawaii'', approved August 1, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 391), consisting of tracts 
        of land on the island of Hawaii and on the island of Maui;
Whereas the portion of the Hawaii National Park situated on the island of Hawaii 
        was renamed Hawaii Volcanoes National Park by Public Law 87-278 (16 
        U.S.C. 391d);
Whereas Hawaii Volcanoes National Park protects and interprets the largest and 
        most continuously active shield volcanoes in the United States and 
        provides the best physical evidence of island-building processes, which 
        continue to form the 2,000 mile-long Hawaiian archipelago;
Whereas Hawaii Volcanoes National Park provides access to two of the most active 
        volcanoes in the world and an opportunity to understand and appreciate 
        the distinctive geology and natural and cultural adaptations to the 
        land;
Whereas, through Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the National Park Service 
        protects, restores, and studies unique and diverse ecosystems and 
        endemic species that are the result of more than 30,000,000 years of 
        evolution in an isolated environment characterized by its active 
        volcanic landscape and wide climate variations;
Whereas, in 1978, more than 100,000 acres of the park were designated as 
        wilderness, which constitutes the largest and most ecologically diverse 
        wilderness in the Pacific Islands, by section 401(6) of the National 
        Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-625; 16 U.S.C. 1132 
        note);
Whereas Hawaii Volcanoes National Park embraces the Native Hawaiian spiritual 
        significance of the landscape and interprets related cultural 
        traditions;
Whereas the park encompasses sites, structures, objects, and landscapes that 
        document more than 600 years of human life and activities on an active 
        volcanic landscape;
Whereas the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization 
        designated Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as a biosphere reserve in 1980 
        and as a World Heritage Site on December 10, 1987;
Whereas, effective July 1, 1961, Haleakala National Park was established by 
        Public Law 86-744 (16 U.S.C. 396b) as a separate unit of the National 
        Park System on the detached portion of the Hawaii National Park on the 
        island of Maui;
Whereas Haleakala National Park protects a wild volcanic landscape with a wide 
        array of fragile and diverse native ecosystems, including plant and 
        animal species found nowhere else on Earth;
Whereas extreme gradients of rainfall and temperature shape the remarkable 
        biodiversity of Haleakala National Park, which rises approximately 
        10,000 feet from the sea to the summit of the Haleakala shield volcano;
Whereas Haleakala National Park preserves places, resources, stories, and 
        intangible elements of profound sacred importance to Native Hawaiians;
Whereas those elements are linked by the piko, the lifeline that honors the past 
        and connects the living Hawaiian culture of today to future generations;
Whereas Haleakala National Park is known for its exceptional scenery, including 
        sunrises and sunsets above the clouds, coursing waterfalls, clear pools, 
        and crashing waves, lush rainforests, and sparkling, star-filled skies;
Whereas the Haleakala shield volcano, one of the highest peaks in the Pacific, 
        is the result of countless volcanic eruptions during the past 2,000,000 
        years and unique erosion in action;
Whereas Public Law 94-567 (16 U.S.C. 1132 note) designated more than 19,000 
        acres of Haleakala National Park as wilderness in 1976, and the United 
        Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization designated 
        the park as a biosphere reserve in 1980;
Whereas Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park were the 
        first national park units in a territory of the United States and are 
        two of the 8 units of the National Park System in the Hawaiian islands; 
        and
Whereas August 1, 2016, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Hawaii 
        Volcanoes and Haleakala National Parks Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates and celebrates Hawaii Volcanoes National 
        Park and Haleakala National Park on the 100th anniversary of 
        their establishment;
            (2) acknowledges the range of natural and cultural wonders 
        that make up the other national parks and monuments of the 
        State of Hawaii, including--
                    (A) Honouliuli National Monument;
                    (B) Kalaupapa National Historical Park;
                    (C) Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park;
                    (D) Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park;
                    (E) Puukohola Heiau National Historic Site; and
                    (F) World War II Valor in the Pacific National 
                Monument;
            (3) encourages the people of Hawaii and of the United 
        States to visit those parks and monuments, which are national 
        treasures; and
            (4) supports the designation of ``Hawaii Volcanoes and 
        Haleakala National Parks Day''.
