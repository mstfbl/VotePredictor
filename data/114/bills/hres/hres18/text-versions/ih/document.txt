                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of January 7, 2015, as ``National Be 
                         Active at Work Day''.

Whereas physical inactivity is a major contributor to the development of 
        obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases;
Whereas sitting for long periods of time at work is a risk factor for obesity, 
        cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and other chronic 
        conditions;
Whereas less than 25 percent of jobs require physical activity and jobs that 
        require primarily sedentary work have become increasingly common;
Whereas exercise performed outside of work does not fully counteract the 
        negative impacts of sitting all day;
Whereas stair climbing burns calories at a high rate, enhances cardiovascular 
        fitness, and promotes healthy lungs;
Whereas walking throughout the day improves cardiovascular health, lowers the 
        risk of obesity, and related diseases;
Whereas stretching improves circulation, increases range of motion, and 
        alleviates stress;
Whereas individuals with physical disabilities can often participate in physical 
        activity throughout the work day with minor modifications;
Whereas all of these activities generally require no special equipment and can 
        be performed by most people regardless of their fitness level;
Whereas many people start the new year with resolutions to improve their health;
Whereas there is a growing effort to encourage people to make small changes in 
        their lives to improve their health; and
Whereas January 7, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National 
        Be Active at Work Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Be Active at 
        Work Day''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with the appropriate activities.
                                 <all>
