                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of May 7, 2015, as a ``National 
    Day of Reason'' and recognizing the importance of reason in the 
                        betterment of humanity.

Whereas the application of reason has proven to offer hope for human survival 
        upon Earth, improving conditions within the universe, and cultivating 
        intelligent, moral, and ethical interactions among people and their 
        environments;
Whereas those who wrote the Constitution of the United States, the basic 
        document for governing the affairs of humankind within the United 
        States, based it upon principles delineated within the philosophies 
        distinguishing the historical Age of Reason;
Whereas most citizens of the United States purport to value reason and its 
        application;
Whereas it is the duty and responsibility of every citizen to promote the 
        development and application of reason; and
Whereas May 7, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as a ``National 
        Day of Reason'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Day of Reason''; 
        and
            (2) encourages all citizens, residents, and visitors to 
        join in observing this day and focusing upon the employment of 
        reason, critical thought, the scientific method, and free 
        inquiry to the resolution of human problems and for the welfare 
        of human kind.
                                 <all>
