                               RESOLUTION


 
           Supporting the goals and ideals of Engineers Week.

Whereas engineers employ their scientific knowledge and analytical skills for 
        the betterment of the United States;
Whereas the mission of DiscoverE (formerly the National Engineers Week 
        Foundation) is to sustain and grow a dynamic engineering profession 
        through outreach, education, celebration, and volunteerism as needed to 
        keep the United States a global leader in engineering and engineering 
        education;
Whereas the sponsors of Engineers Week are working together to transform the 
        engineering workforce through greater inclusion of women and 
        underrepresented minorities;
Whereas by engaging young students, parents, and educators in hands-on science, 
        technology, engineering, and math, engineers help them discover how they 
        can make a meaningful difference in the world;
Whereas the partnership between engineers and teachers inspires future 
        generations of engineering and technology talent;
Whereas tens of thousands of engineers and engineering students will serve their 
        communities not only through their work but, at this time of year, by 
        reaching into hundreds of local communities;
Whereas engineers have helped meet the major global challenges of our time, 
        including providing state-of-the-art transportation and information 
        technology infrastructures, enhancing national security, and developing 
        the clean energy technologies needed to power the people of the United 
        States into the future;
Whereas most people in the United States continue to say that the benefits of 
        science outweigh the potential harms and that the Federal Government 
        should fund research that ``advances the frontiers of knowledge'', 
        according to the National Science Board's 2014 Science and Engineering 
        Indicators;
Whereas engineers are a crucial link in research, development, and the 
        transformation of scientific discoveries into useful products and jobs, 
        as the people of the United States look more than ever to engineers and 
        their imagination, knowledge, and analytical skills to meet the 
        challenges of the future;
Whereas the National Science Board's ``Science and Engineering Indicators 2010 
        and 2012'' shows that while the number of students obtaining engineering 
        degrees in the United States has reached an all-time high, the rates for 
        women do not reflect our national demographics, with only 19 percent of 
        bachelor's degrees in engineering being earned by women;
Whereas the National Science Board's ``Science and Engineering Indicators 2014'' 
        show that historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, 
        particularly Blacks and Hispanics, continue to display lower S&E 
        participation rates relative to their presence in the United States 
        population comprising about 10 percent of workers in S&E occupations;
Whereas only 4 percent of the Nation's workforce is composed of scientists and 
        engineers, this group disproportionately creates jobs for the other 96 
        percent;
Whereas DiscoverE has grown into a formal coalition of more than 100 
        professional societies, major corporations, and government agencies that 
        serves as a hub of engineering outreach dedicated to ensuring a diverse 
        and well-educated engineering workforce, promoting literacy in science, 
        technology, engineering, and math, and raising public awareness and 
        appreciation of the contributions of engineers to society; and
Whereas February 21, 2016, to February 27, 2016, has been designated as 
        Engineers Week by DiscoverE and the theme is, ``Engineers Make a World 
        of Difference'', spotlighting the important contributions of the 
        engineering community to our quality of life now and in the future, 
        especially in the areas of energy, water, and food sustainability: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Engineers Week to 
        increase understanding of and interest in engineering and 
        technology careers and to promote technological literacy and 
        engineering education;
            (2) recognizes that engineering education is a critical 
        component of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics) education and essential to improving the United 
        States educational system and economic prosperity; and
            (3) ensures that technological solutions designed by the 
        engineering community can be advanced through research, 
        development, standardization, and innovation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
