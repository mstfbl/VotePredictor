        Bilingual/Multilingual Learner Advocacy Month;
Whereas ``National Bilingual/Multilingual Learner Advocacy Month'' recognizes 
        that bilingual/multilingual learners are one of the fastest growing

        multiple assets to schools and adds to the rich diversity among 
        students;

Whereas ``National Bilingual/Multilingual Learner Advocacy Month'' encourages 
        institutions to adopt policies and practices such as dual language

        academic achievement, and increase graduation rates;
Whereas ``National Bilingual/Multilingual Learner Advocacy Month'' calls for the

        significant languages and cultural assets that bilingual/multilingual
