                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Cambodia.

Whereas since the Paris Peace Accords in 1991, Cambodia has undergone a gradual, 
        partial, and unsteady transition to democracy, including elections and 
        multiparty government;
Whereas Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power in Cambodia uninterrupted since 
        1985 and is the longest-serving leader in Southeast Asia;
Whereas Freedom House rated Cambodia as ``Not Free'' in its ``Freedom in the 
        World 2015'' report, noting that ``political opposition is restricted'', 
        ``harassment or threats against opposition supporters are not 
        uncommon'', ``freedom of speech is not fully protected'', and ``the 
        government's tolerance for freedoms of association and assembly has 
        declined in recent years'';
Whereas Cambodia held a general election on July 28, 2013, though widespread 
        reports of irregularities largely related to the voter lists bring into 
        question the integrity of the election;
Whereas a coalition of election monitors, including the National Democratic 
        Institute (NDI), Transparency International Cambodia, and other domestic 
        and international organizations, in a joint report on the 2013 election 
        found ``significant challenges that undermined the credibility of the 
        process'';
Whereas Transparency International Cambodia, a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
        organization, conducted a survey during the 2013 election that found at 
        60 percent of polling stations, citizens with proper identification were 
        not allowed to vote;
Whereas the Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) was accused of lack of 
        independence and pro-government bias during its oversight of the 2013 
        election;
Whereas the composition of the NEC was changed after the 2013 election to 
        include equal membership from both political parties, and the NEC's 
        continued independence is essential to free and fair elections;
Whereas the United States Congress has taken steps to protect democracy and 
        human rights in Cambodia, making certain 2014 foreign aid funds intended 
        to Cambodia conditioned upon the Government of Cambodia conducting an 
        independent and credible investigation into the irregularities 
        associated with the July 28, 2013, parliamentary elections and reforming 
        the NEC or when all parties have agreed to join the National Assembly to 
        conduct business;
Whereas United States aid to Cambodia has funded work in areas including 
        development assistance, civil society, global health, and the Khmer 
        Rouge Tribunal, largely via nongovernmental organizations (NGOs);
Whereas both NDI and the International Republican Institute (IRI) operate in 
        Cambodia, engaging local partners and building capacity for civil 
        society, democracy, and good governance;
Whereas the Government of Cambodia has acted to restrict the right to freely 
        assemble and protest, including the following instances;
Whereas, on January 3, 2014, Cambodian security forces violently cracked down on 
        protests of garment workers, killing 4 people in Phnom Penh;
Whereas, on March 31, 2014, Cambodian police beat protestors with batons and 
        clubs during a protest calling for a license for the independent Beehive 
        Radio to establish a television channel;
Whereas in August 2015, the Government of Cambodia passed the ``Law on 
        Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations'' which threatens to 
        restrict the development of civil society by requiring registration and 
        government approval of both domestic and international NGOs;
Whereas, on October 26, 2015, 2 opposition lawmakers, including dual United 
        States citizen Nhay Chamreoun, were violently attacked by pro-government 
        protestors in front of the National Assembly;
Whereas, on November 16, 2015, the standing committee of the National Assembly 
        expelled leader of the parliamentary opposition and President of the 
        Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) Sam Rainsy and revoked his 
        parliamentary immunity;
Whereas Mr. Rainsy is the subject of a Government of Cambodia investigation of 
        7-year-old defamation charges against him which is widely believed to be 
        politically motivated;
Whereas the United States Embassy in Cambodia has publicly called on the 
        Government of Cambodia to revoke the arrest warrant issued against Mr. 
        Rainsy, allow all opposition lawmakers to ``return to Cambodia without 
        fear of arrest and persecution'', and ``to take immediate steps to 
        guarantee a political space free from threats or intimidation in 
        Cambodia''; and
Whereas national elections in 2018 will be closely watched to ensure openness 
        and fairness, and to monitor whether all political parties and civil 
        society are allowed to freely participate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to 
        promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in 
        Cambodia;
            (2) condemns all forms of political violence in Cambodia 
        and urges the cessation of ongoing human rights violations;
            (3) calls on the Government of Cambodia to respect freedom 
        of the press and the rights of its citizens to freely assemble, 
        protest, and speak out against the government;
            (4) supports electoral reform efforts in Cambodia and free 
        and fair elections in 2018 monitored by international 
        observers; and
            (5) urges Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian People's 
        Party to--
                    (A) end all harassment and intimidation of 
                Cambodia's opposition;
                    (B) drop all politically motivated charges against 
                opposition lawmakers;
                    (C) allow them to return to Cambodia and freely 
                participate in the political process; and
                    (D) foster an environment where democracy can 
                thrive and flourish.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
