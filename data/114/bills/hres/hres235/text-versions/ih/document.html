                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing deepest condolences to and solidarity with the people of 
     Nepal following the devastating earthquake on April 25, 2015.

Whereas, on April 25, 2015, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the country of 
        Nepal;
Whereas according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake 
        epicenter was located approximately 48 miles northwest from the capital, 
        Kathmandu;
Whereas the USGS already has registered over 50 aftershocks between magnitudes 
        4.0 and 6.7 and reports that additional aftershocks over magnitude 5.0 
        or greater may be expected;
Whereas the reported death toll has reached over 4,000, thousands more people 
        have been reported injured, and critical infrastructure, including 
        roads, hospitals, and homes, has been damaged or destroyed;
Whereas the United Nations estimates that up to 8,000,000 people have been 
        affected by the earthquake, including an estimated 1,400,000 people in 
        need of immediate food assistance;
Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that nearly one 
        million children will require urgent humanitarian assistance;
Whereas the United States responded immediately to the disaster and the United 
        States Agency for International Development (USAID) has deployed a 128-
        person Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Nepal, including 
        search and rescue efforts, emergency shelter, and water, sanitation and 
        health;
Whereas the United States has committed $10,000,000 to date for earthquake 
        response and recovery efforts in Nepal, including search and rescue 
        efforts, emergency shelter, and water, sanitation and health;
Whereas individuals, businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the 
        United States and throughout the international community have responded 
        in support of Nepal; and
Whereas humanitarian access has been severely constrained by the magnitude of 
        destruction, the region's mountainous terrain, and the remoteness of 
        impacted areas: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its deepest condolences to and solidarity 
        with the people of Nepal following the devastating earthquake 
        on April 25, 2015;
            (2) supports the efforts of the Administration to 
        coordinate an immediate, effective United States Government 
        humanitarian response and to provide relief to affected 
        communities;
            (3) commends the efforts and honors the sacrifice of the 
        men and women engaged in the response, including the citizens 
        and Government of Nepal, the United States, and international 
        humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations; and
            (4) urges the Administration, in coordination with the 
        Nepalese Government and other donors, to continue to provide 
        emergency relief and reconstruction efforts in Nepal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
