 Recognizing the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado 
 Springs, Colorado, as America's National World War II Aviation Museum.

Whereas World War II was one of the most important events in the history of the 
        Nation, a time of moral clarity and common purpose that remains today as 
        an inspiration to all people in the United States;
Whereas the role of aviation was a critical factor in the success of winning 
        World War II and defeating the enemies worldwide;
Whereas the bravery, courage, dedication, and heroism of World War II aviators 
        and support personnel was an important element in the winning of World 
        War II;
Whereas the National Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, 
        Colorado, is the only museum in the United States that exists to 
        exclusively preserve and promote an understanding of the role of 
        aviation in winning World War II; and
Whereas the National Museum of World War II Aviation is dedicated to celebrating 
        the spirit of the United States, recognizing the teamwork, 
        collaboration, patriotism, and courage of the men and women who fought, 
        as well as those on the homefront who mobilized and supported the 
        national aviation effort: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the National 
Museum of World War II Aviation in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as 
America's National World War II Aviation Museum.
                                 <all>
