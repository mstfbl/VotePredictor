                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding sexually 
          exploited and trafficked girls in the United States.

Whereas most girls subjected to commercial sexual exploitation and trafficking 
        come from a broken child welfare system or are runaway youth that were 
        subsequently preyed upon by exploiters and traffickers;
Whereas it is important to provide education for family, friends, and neighbors 
        to understand that these girls are victims;
Whereas survivors of domestic trafficking need support in their efforts to raise 
        awareness on identifying trafficked girls and the systems of support 
        that such girls require to heal from the complex trauma of sexual 
        violence and exploitation;
Whereas the same protections and supports available to victims of child abuse 
        should be extended to child victims of trafficking; and
Whereas exploited and trafficked girls are not ``bad girls'' or ``child 
        prostitutes'', but are victims of systemized rape who need the same 
        legal supports and protections other rape victims are afforded: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports efforts to--
            (1) provide protections and supports for sexually exploited 
        and trafficked girls in the United States; and
            (2) create criminal or civil penalties for anyone who buys 
        or sells a child through a system of child trafficking.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
