                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 150th anniversary of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I.

Whereas the beauty of Hawaii is rooted in the people who celebrate, perpetuate, 
        and share its unique culture and history;
Whereas stewards of Hawaii's cultural and historical treasures are members of 
        the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, the first institution of its kind to 
        promote and defend the Kingdom of Hawaii;
Whereas the Royal Order of Kamehameha I was established on April 11, 1865, by 
        His Majesty Kamehameha V, Lot Kapuaiwa Kalanikapuapaikalaninui Aliiolani 
        Kalanimakua;
Whereas the Royal Order of Kamehameha I is comprised of men who preserve and 
        perpetuate Native Hawaiian culture;
Whereas the Royal Order of Kamehameha I strives to create a thriving lahui by 
        supporting and empowering kanaka oiwi physically, mentally, and 
        spiritually;
Whereas the nine chapters of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I continue advocacy 
        for Native Hawaiians, and the chapters representing several of the 
        islands are as follows--

    (1) Moku O Hawaii;

    (2) Moku O Mamalahoa;

    (3) Moku O Kaumualii;

    (4) Moku O Kahekili;

    (5) Moku O Kalanianaole;

    (6) Moku O Kuhio;

    (7) Moku O Kona;

    (8) Moku O Kapuaiwa; and

    (9) Moku O Kohala; and

Whereas April 11, 2015, started the yearlong 150-year commemoration of the Royal 
        Order of Kamehameha I that culminates on April 11, 2016: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives celebrates the legacy 
of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, and recognizes the importance of 
the organization, its members, and this sesquicentennial event.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
