 Honoring the Portland Timbers as the champions of Major League Soccer 
                                in 2015.

Whereas, on December 6, 2015, the Portland Timbers won the Major League Soccer 
        Cup, the championship match of Major League Soccer;
Whereas by defeating the Columbus Crew by a score of 2 to 1, the Portland 
        Timbers won their first Major League Soccer championship and the 20th 
        edition of the Major League Soccer Cup;
Whereas Portland Timbers players Diego Valeri and Rodney Wallace scored goals in 
        the Major League Soccer Cup;
Whereas the goal by Diego Valeri in the first minute of the match was the 
        earliest in Cup history;
Whereas Portland Timbers midfielder Diego Valeri was designated by Major League 
        Soccer as the Most Valuable Player of the Major League Soccer Cup;
Whereas the victory of the Portland Timbers in the Major League Soccer Cup was 
        the first Major League Soccer championship win for Portland Timbers head 
        coach, Caleb Porter, and Portland Timbers owner, Merritt Paulson;
Whereas the victory of the Portland Timbers in the Major League Soccer Cup was 
        the first such championship for any team in the Pacific Northwest;
Whereas by giving back to the community through charity work, the Portland 
        Timbers organization inspires the people of Soccer City, USA, also known 
        as Portland, Oregon, both on and off the pitch;
Whereas the supporters group of the Portland Timbers, the Timbers Army 
        exemplifies pride in the Rose City, where there is no pity;
Whereas the Timbers Army, through contributions to their community, club, and 
        country, are the greatest of all supporters in Major League Soccer; and
Whereas the success of the Portland Timbers soccer team will broaden an 
        appreciation of athletics in young people and encourage Oregonians to 
        volunteer in their communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the Portland Timbers as the champions of Major 
        League Soccer in 2015;
            (2) recognizes the outstanding achievement of the Portland 
        Timbers team, ownership, and staff; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Clerk of the House to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the Portland 
        Timbers.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
