                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives recognizing 
    community water fluoridation as one of the great public health 
                  initiatives on its 70th anniversary.

Whereas fluoridation of community water supplies is the single most effective 
        public health measure to prevent tooth decay;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has proclaimed community 
        water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the 
        20th century; and
Whereas studies prove water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing 
        dental decay by at least 25 percent in children and adults, even in the 
        of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as 
        fluoride toothpaste: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes community 
water fluoridation as a vitally important public health initiative on 
its 70th anniversary.
                                 <all>
