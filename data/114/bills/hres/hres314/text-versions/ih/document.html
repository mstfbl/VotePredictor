                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
eligibility of veterans service organizations for community development 
                          block grant funding.

Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and other veterans 
        service organizations, through local posts, provide a host of invaluable 
        services to veterans across the United States, including benefits 
        assistance, career services, financial assistance, homeless outreach, 
        and supporting services;
Whereas veteran service organizations also provide several important services 
        for local communities, including various educational programs, and 
        providing shelter during public emergencies; and
Whereas notwithstanding the critical services provided by veteran service 
        organizations to veterans and the public, some posts may be deemed 
        ineligible for Federal community development block grant funding for 
        public facilities and improvements; Now, therefore, be it--
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) veterans service organizations provide invaluable 
        services to the veterans and local communities across the 
        United States; and
            (2) Congress should seek changes to Federal law to ensure 
        that all veteran service organizations are eligible for 
        community development block grant funding for public facilities 
        and improvements funding.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
