                               RESOLUTION


 
Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to observe a moment 
of silence in the House on the first legislative day of each month for 
     those killed or wounded in United States engagements in Iraq, 
 Afghanistan, and other countries where Americans are serving in harms 
                                  way.

    Resolved, That rule XIV of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new 
clause:
    ``7. On the first legislative day of each month on which there is a 
record vote on any bill or joint resolution, immediately after that 
vote, a moment of silence shall be observed on behalf of those killed 
or wounded (as well as their families) in current United States 
engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries where Americans 
are serving in harms way. There is no more sacred duty than to honor 
those who pay the ultimate sacrifice, so the moment of silence shall be 
led by the Speaker of the House or his designee.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
