                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
    States should initiate negotiations to enter into a free trade 
                        agreement with Tunisia.

Whereas the bilateral relationship between the United States and Tunisia dates 
        back to 1795;
Whereas the Arab Spring has swept through Northern Africa and the Middle East, 
        creating the greatest opportunity in more than a generation for true 
        democratic development in the region;
Whereas the resulting upheaval also creates enormous potential for instability, 
        violence, and power vacuums that could be exploited by anti-democratic 
        or extremist forces;
Whereas a key influence that drove protests in Tunisia came from Mohamed 
        Bouazizi, a street vendor who set himself on fire to protest corruption 
        and a lack of economic opportunities;
Whereas Mr. Bouazizi's death in December 2010 became a rallying cry for more 
        democracy and economic freedom in Tunisia;
Whereas demonstrations by the Tunisian people forced President Zine el Abidine 
        Ben Ali to flee Tunisia on January 14, 2011, after more than 23 years of 
        authoritarian rule;
Whereas the political transition became known as the ``Jasmine Revolution'' and 
        sparked the Arab Spring throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East;
Whereas, on January 26, 2014, Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly adopted a 
        new constitution;
Whereas national elections were held on October 26, 2014, to select a 217-seat 
        Assembly of the Representatives of the People;
Whereas, on December 31, 2014, Beji Caid Essebsi was sworn into office as 
        Tunisia's first freely elected President;
Whereas the October Tunisian elections were widely praised by international 
        election observers;
Whereas disputes over reform priorities, economic crisis, labor unrest, regional 
        tension, and lingering insecurity are continuing challenges;
Whereas Tunisia exhibits a number of unique attributes in its region, such as a 
        relatively small territory, a sizable and well-educated middle class, 
        and a long history of encouraging women's socioeconomic freedoms;
Whereas unrest, political uncertainty, turmoil in neighboring Libya, and 
        economic crisis in Europe have contributed to severe economic 
        difficulties in Tunisia;
Whereas it is estimated that Tunisia's economic growth was 2.3 percent in 2014 
        and will be 2.7 percent in 2015;
Whereas jobs and living standards remain the primary concern for most Tunisians;
Whereas if the economic aspirations of the Tunisian people are not realized, the 
        potential for anti-democratic or extremist forces to exploit instability 
        will only be magnified;
Whereas strong, sustained economic growth and development would provide the 
        necessary resources for Tunisia to build democratic institutions and 
        solidify public support for democratic governance, as well as ensure 
        strong labor, environmental, and human rights protections;
Whereas engagement with Tunisia through trade negotiations would encourage 
        greater reform, including the protection of intellectual property, and 
        build its capacity to modernize and liberalize its economy, as well as 
        provide maximum leverage to facilitate the implementation of strong 
        labor, environmental, and human rights protections;
Whereas a vibrant, stable, and prosperous democracy in Tunisia is in the 
        interest of the United States and would fuel both economic and 
        democratic development throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East;
Whereas prior to the Jasmine Revolution, the United States was Tunisia's fifth-
        largest trading partner;
Whereas in 2014 exports from the United States to Tunisia were $850,000,000 and 
        imports from Tunisia into the United States were $521,200,000;
Whereas Tunisia is an important market for United States grain, seeds, and 
        cereal exports;
Whereas Tunisia is an important source of oil, fats and food oils, and textiles 
        for the United States;
Whereas the United States and Tunisia have re-launched negotiations for a Trade 
        and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA); and
Whereas Tunisia has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1995: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should initiate negotiations to enter into a free 
trade agreement with Tunisia.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
