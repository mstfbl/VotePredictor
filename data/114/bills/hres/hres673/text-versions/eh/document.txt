H. Res. 673

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        April 19, 2016.
Whereas each year, Internal Revenue Service Publication 17, entitled ``Your 
        Federal Income Tax'', provides individuals with general instructions on 
        how to file their tax returns for the previous taxable year;
Whereas in each year prior to 2015, free printed versions of Internal Revenue 
        Service Publication 17 were made widely available to taxpayers at 
        libraries, post offices, and taxpayer service offices, and even by mail 
        at the request of a taxpayer;
Whereas the Internal Revenue Service no longer disseminates a free printed 
        version of Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 as it transitions to 
        a fully electronic tax filing system, including an electronic system for 
        providing instructions on filing tax returns;
Whereas the Internal Revenue Service directs taxpayers to the Internet to 
        download an electronic version of Internal Revenue Service Publication 
        17, even though the limited availability of a printed version of this 
        publication burdens individuals who do not have access to a computer or 
        printer and individuals who struggle to navigate a computer;
Whereas the dissemination of printed copies of Internal Revenue Service 
        Publication 17 is a basic taxpayer service that the Internal Revenue 
        Service is ignoring;
Whereas the Internal Revenue Service should prioritize its resources on areas 
        that are critical to the ability of taxpayers to file their tax returns 
        in a timely and proper manner;
Whereas the decision of the Internal Revenue Service to stop disseminating 
        printed copies of Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 adversely 
        impacts populations that do not have access to, or understand how to 
        use, a computer, and the decision unnecessarily burdens and restricts 
        the ability of taxpayers to comply with the convoluted and complicated 
        provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
Whereas Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 is clear evidence of the need 
        for comprehensive tax reform that simplifies the Internal Revenue Code 
        so that individuals can complete their tax returns and pay their taxes 
        without needing the nearly 300 pages of instructions that currently make 
        up Publication 17: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges the Internal Revenue 
Service to--
            (1) resume printing copies of Internal Revenue Service Publication 
        17; and
            (2) provide free copies of such publication to the taxpayers of the 
        United States.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
