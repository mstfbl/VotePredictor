                               RESOLUTION


 
Denouncing the wrongful and unjust seizure and confiscation of private 
property of Iranians both inside and outside of Iran, including United 
     States citizens of Iranian descent, by the Government of Iran.

Whereas the Government of Iran came to power in 1979 and is ruled to this day by 
        an autocratic government;
Whereas victims of the Government of Iran included individuals persecuted or 
        targeted for persecution based on their political beliefs and 
        associations, as well as their religious, ethnic, and cultural 
        identities;
Whereas an instrumentality of state persecution included the wrongful and unjust 
        seizure and confiscation of private property including real property, 
        personal property, and financial assets;
Whereas a great number of owners of such property fled for safety to the United 
        States or Europe and are now citizens of those countries;
Whereas the Government of Iran has transferred ownership of such confiscated 
        property to government-affiliated foundations and related institutions; 
        and
Whereas the Government of Iran has shown no sign that it intends to return or 
        compensate the rightful owners of said government's wrongful property 
        seizures: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) denounces the wrongful and unjust seizure and 
        confiscation of private property of Iranians both inside and 
        outside of Iran, including United States citizens of Iranian 
        descent, by the Government of Iran; and
            (2) calls on the Government of Iran to provide fair, 
        comprehensive, and nondiscriminatory restitution of or 
        compensation for all such property wrongfully and unjustly 
        seized and confiscated by the Government of Iran.
                                 <all>
