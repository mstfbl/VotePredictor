                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing concern over anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within 
                       the Palestinian Authority.

Whereas the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly 
        referred to as Oslo II, specifically details that Israel and the 
        Palestinian Authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile 
        propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the 
        principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent 
        such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their 
        jurisdiction'';
Whereas in spite of the Oslo II agreement, the President of the Palestinian 
        Authority, Mahmoud Abbas repeatedly describes released Palestinian 
        terrorists as ``heroes'' and Fatah's military wing publicly threatens to 
        kidnap soldiers and launch missiles at Israel on the Fatah Facebook page 
        and website;
Whereas the Palestinian Authority pays monthly ``salaries'' to families of 
        Palestinian terrorists incarcerated in Israel;
Whereas in June 2013, Abbas referenced Israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and 
        dangerous plot to destroy Al-Aqsa and build the alleged temple'';
Whereas in a November 2014 address commemorating the 10th anniversary of Yasser 
        Arafat's death, Abbas said that as Israel has no claim to Jerusalem, he 
        will not allow the Temple Mount to be ``contaminated by Jews'', and 
        threatened that Jewish prayer at the site would cause a ``devastating 
        religious war'';
Whereas in November 2014, jailed terrorist and Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti 
        called for ``comprehensive resistance and the rifle'' against Israel;
Whereas Palestinian Authority Deputy Minister of Information Al-Mutawakkil Taha 
        told official Palestian Authority daily newspaper Al Hayat Al Jadida in 
        early 2012 that, ``Israel has gone beyond all forms of oppression 
        practiced by fascism throughout history'' and that it``does more than 
        racist discrimination and ethnic cleansing'';
Whereas official Palestinian websites and Facebook pages, including those of 
        Abbas' Presidential Guards and Palestinian Authority schools, 
        recurrently show maps of the land without reference to Israel and in 
        November 2012, the Palestinian Authority erected a statue in central 
        Bethlehem square that displayed a map of the ``state of Palestine'' 
        covering all of Israel;
Whereas the Oslo II agreement further dictates that Israel and the Palestinian 
        Authority ``will ensure that their respective educational systems 
        contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and 
        to peace in the entire region'';
Whereas Zayzafuna, a monthly educational magazine for children sponsored by the 
        Palestinian National Committee for Education, Culture and Sciences, 
        regularly presents Adolf Hitler as a role model and in January 2012, 
        Facebook pages of several Palestinian Authority high schools posted 
        images of Hitler with his quotation, ``I could have killed all the Jews 
        in the world, but I left a few so that you would know why I killed 
        them'';
Whereas a teacher in a summer camp near Nablus in July 2013 can be seen in video 
        footage leading children in a call and response saying, ``Palestine is 
        an Arab land from the river to the sea. We want Haifa, we want Acre'';
Whereas in July 2013, Palestinian official television aired a video of two girls 
        reciting a poem that calls Jews ``barbaric monkeys, wretched pigs'' and 
        asserts that Jerusalem is not for Jews, because Jerusalem ``vomits'' out 
        the Jews who are said to be ``filth'' and ``impure'';
Whereas section 7040 (e) of the Consolidated and Further Continuing 
        Appropriations Act, 2015, requires the Secretary of State, if the 
        President waives section 7040 (a) of that same Act, to ``certify and 
        report to the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of 
        funds that . . . the Palestinian Authority is acting to counter 
        incitement of violence against Israelis and is supporting activities 
        aimed at promoting peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with 
        Israel'';
Whereas the Palestinian Authority has not fully lived up to its prior agreements 
        with Israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the 
        Palestinian people for peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and 
        organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis 
        and Palestinians, including--
                    (A) Professor Mohammed Dajani Daoudi, who took 
                students from al-Quds University in Jerusalem to visit 
                Auschwitz in March 2014 only to return to death threats 
                by fellow Palestinians and expulsion from his teacher's 
                union;
                    (B) the Israel Palestine Center for Research and 
                Information, the only joint Israeli-Palestinian public 
                policy think-tank;
                    (C) United Hatzalah, a nonprofit, fully volunteer 
                Emergency Medical Services organization that, 
                mobilizing volunteers who are religious or secular 
                Jews, Arabs, Muslims, and Christians, provides EMS 
                services to all people in Israel regardless of race, 
                religion, or national origin; and
                    (D) Breaking the Impasse, an apolitical initiative 
                of Palestinian and Israeli business and civil society 
                leaders who advocate for a two-state solution and an 
                urgent diplomatic solution to the conflict;
            (2) reiterates strong condemnation of anti-Israel and anti-
        Semitic incitement in the Palestinian Authority as antithetical 
        to the cause of peace;
            (3) urges President Abbas and Palestinian Authority 
        officials to discontinue all official incitement and exert 
        influence to discourage anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement 
        in Palestinian civil society; and
            (4) directs the United States Department of State to 
        regularly monitor and publish information on all official 
        incitement by the Palestinian Authority against Jews and the 
        State of Israel.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
