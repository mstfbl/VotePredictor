H. Res. 293

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                      November 2, 2015.
Whereas the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly 
        referred to as Oslo II, specifically details that Israel and the 
        Palestinian Authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile 
        propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the 
        principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent 
        such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their 
        jurisdiction'';
Whereas the Oslo II agreement further states that Israel and the Palestinian 
        Authority ``will ensure that their respective educational systems 
        contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and 
        to peace in the entire region'';
Whereas Palestinian Authority incitement against Israelis has continued unabated 
        for many years despite periods of negotiations between Israel and the 
        Palestinian Authority;
Whereas this incitement takes on many forms, and has included the glorification 
        of terrorists who have murdered Israeli civilians; advocating struggle 
        against Israel despite entering into negotiations with Israel; the 
        demonization of Jews and Israelis, including by the use of anti-Semitic 
        motifs; the denial of Israel's existence and its delegitimization as 
        evidenced by the absence of Israel on official maps used in Palestinian 
        Authority institutions; and false claims that Israel or the Jews are 
        endangering Muslim holy sites, such as the Al-Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount 
        in Jerusalem;
Whereas in June 2013, Abbas referenced Israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and 
        dangerous plot to destroy Al-Aqsa and build the alleged temple'';
Whereas on September 16, 2015, Abbas stated on Palestinian television that ``we 
        welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, 
        clean blood, blood on its way to Allah. With the help of Allah, every 
        martyr will be in heaven, and every wounded will get his reward'';
Whereas since mid-September 2015 there has been a wave of Palestinian violence 
        in Israel and the West Bank, including stabbings, shootings, and other 
        terrorist acts;
Whereas this situation has been inflamed by statements made by Palestinian 
        President Abbas, other Palestinian officials, clerics, and official 
        Palestinian Authority media, and frequently amplified on social media 
        platforms;
Whereas these statements have included repeated false claims that Israel seeks 
        to change the ``status quo'' on the Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque 
        compound;
Whereas despite the incitement-induced wave of terrorism, the Palestinian 
        Authority security forces and the Israel Defense Forces have continued 
        security cooperation;
Whereas section 7038 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations 
        Act, 2015 states that ``none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
        available by this Act may be used to provide equipment, technical 
        support, consulting services, or any other form of assistance to the 
        Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation'';
Whereas section 7040(e) of the Consolidated and Further Continuing 
        Appropriations Act, 2015 requires the Secretary of State, if the 
        President waives section 7040(a) of that Act, to ``certify and report to 
        the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that * 
        * * the Palestinian Authority is acting to counter incitement of 
        violence against Israelis and is supporting activities aimed at 
        promoting peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with Israel''; 
        and
Whereas the Palestinian Authority has not fully lived up to its prior agreements 
        with Israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the 
        Palestinian people for peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and 
        organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and 
        Palestinians;
            (2) strongly condemns the wave of violent attacks in Israel and the 
        West Bank;
            (3) reiterates the strong condemnation of anti-Israel and anti-
        Semitic incitement to violence in the Palestinian Authority as 
        antithetical to the cause of peace;
            (4) calls on the Palestinian Authority to--
                    (A) immediately discontinue incitement to violence in all 
                Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets, and officially 
                and publicly repudiate attacks against Israelis and engage in a 
                sustained effort to publicly and officially rebuke anti-Israel 
                incitement to violence;
                    (B) continue important security cooperation with Israel; and
                    (C) agree to unconditionally renew direct talks with the 
                Israelis, including the reconstitution of the Trilateral 
                Commission on Incitement;
            (5) encourages responsible nations to condemn in the strongest 
        possible terms incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority;
            (6) expresses support for the Government of Israel in its fight 
        against terror;
            (7) directs the Department of State to regularly monitor and publish 
        information on all official incitement by the Palestinian Authority 
        against Jews and the State of Israel; and
            (8) calls on the Administration to continue publicly repudiating and 
        raising the issue of Palestinian anti-Israel incitement to violence in 
        all appropriate bilateral and international forums.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
