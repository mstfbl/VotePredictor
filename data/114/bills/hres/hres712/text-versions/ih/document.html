                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of May 2016 as ``Mental Health 
                                Month''.

Whereas the mental health and well-being of people in the United States is a 
        vital issue that affects not only quality of life, but also the health 
        of communities, families, and economic stability;
Whereas the stigma associated with mental health continues to persist;
Whereas individuals with mental illness and behavioral health disorders can and 
        do recover utilizing treatment regimens, including psychosocial 
        therapies, peer support, and clinical help, as well as other behavioral, 
        psychiatric, psychological, faith-based and pastoral care, and medical 
        services;
Whereas parents, families, and caregivers are allies in recovery and serve as 
        critical members of the care delivery team;
Whereas advances in brain and behavioral research show significant promise for 
        continued improvements in effective treatments of mental illness;
Whereas 43,800,000 adults in the United States experience mental illness;
Whereas approximately 1 in 5 children and adolescents has a diagnosable mental 
        disorder;
Whereas 9,800,000 adults in the United States experience conditions such as 
        schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression;
Whereas nearly 40 percent of adults in the United States with a diagnosis of 
        serious mental illness do not receive treatment in any given year;
Whereas post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) impacts 11 to 20 percent of 
        servicemembers and veterans of operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and 
        Enduring Freedom (OEF);
Whereas every day an estimated 22 veterans die by suicide;
Whereas roughly 20 to 50 percent of all prison and jail inmates are diagnosed 
        with a mental illness and United States prisons are home to 10 times 
        more people with mental illness than psychiatric hospitals;
Whereas mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the Nation;
Whereas untreated mental illness is a leading cause of absenteeism and lost 
        productivity in the workplace and costs the United States economy over 
        $193,000,000,000 per year in lost earnings;
Whereas there are approximately 42,770 suicides each year;
Whereas suicide is the second leading cause of death among individuals between 
        the ages of 15 and 34;
Whereas 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental health condition;
Whereas Native Americans currently are twice as likely to commit suicide as 
        other gender or racial subgroups;
Whereas studies report that people with serious mental illness die, on average, 
        25 years earlier than the general population;
Whereas those with mental illness are 3 to 4 times more likely to be the victims 
        of crime and abuse;
Whereas lack of awareness of one's mental illness, known as anosognosia, affects 
        approximately 50 percent of individuals with schizophrenia and 40 
        percent of individuals with bipolar disorder making it more challenging 
        to receive care;
Whereas the delay between a first episode of psychosis and onset of treatment is 
        an average of 80 weeks;
Whereas recovery-oriented interventions such as supported employment, supported 
        housing, and supported education have been shown to improve outcomes;
Whereas the faith community provides a vital link in ministering and serving 
        individuals and families in need of mental health services;
Whereas individuals engaged in peer recovery support services utilize crisis and 
        emergency services less; and
Whereas it would be appropriate to observe May 2016 as ``Mental Health Month'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Mental Health Month'' to 
        remove the stigma associated with mental illness and place 
        emphasis on scientific findings regarding mental health 
        recovery;
            (2) recognizes mental well-being is equally as important as 
        physical well-being for citizens, communities, businesses, and 
        the economy in the United States;
            (3) applauds the coalescing of national, community, 
        medical, and faith-based organizations in working to promote 
        public awareness of mental health and providing critical 
        information and support to the people and families affected by 
        mental illness; and
            (4) encourages all to draw on ``Mental Health Month'' as an 
        opportunity to promote mental well-being and awareness, ensure 
        access to appropriate services, and support overall quality of 
        life for those living with mental illness.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
