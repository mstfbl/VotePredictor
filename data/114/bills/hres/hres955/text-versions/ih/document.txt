                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
 progress of peace and justice, accountability, and reconciliation in 
Sri Lanka after 26 years of a debilitating armed conflict, and support 
   for inclusive development and a strong and enduring relationship 
                between the United States and Sri Lanka.

Whereas more than 7 years have now passed since the end of the 26-year conflict 
        between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Government of Sri 
        Lanka;
Whereas the people of Sri Lanka suffered greatly as a result of this conflict, 
        the impact and aftermath of which has been felt especially by women, 
        children, and families;
Whereas the United States and Sri Lanka have a long standing partnership based 
        in large part on shared democratic traditions;
Whereas Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in as the new President of Sri Lanka in 
        January 2015, campaigning on a message of anticorruption, inclusion, and 
        reconciliation, and marking the beginning of a new era of the United 
        States-Sri Lanka ties;
Whereas in September 2015, the United States, Sri Lanka, and other international 
        partners tabled a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Council 
        that emphasized the importance of truth, justice, reparations, and 
        guarantees of nonrecurrence in promoting reconciliation and an enduring 
        peace and prosperity for all Sri Lankans;
Whereas in October 2015, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian nation to join 
        the Open Government Partnership, expanding upon their renewed commitment 
        to transparency and accountability;
Whereas, on February 26, 2016, the United States and Sri Lanka held its first 
        annual Partnership Dialogue in Washington, DC, demonstrating the 
        strengthening of bilateral relations through regular and structured 
        engagement;
Whereas the Governments of the United States and Sri Lanka convened the 12th 
        United States Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) Council on 
        April 28, 2016, in Washington, DC, and agreed to further strengthen 
        United States-Sri Lanka economic cooperation;
Whereas the United States Congress' House Democracy Partnership and the 
        Parliament of Sri Lanka signed a Collaboration Agreement on September 
        14, 2016, to engage in a mutually beneficial partnership between the two 
        legislatures;
Whereas reconciliation is a long-term process that will need to be led by the 
        Sri Lankan Government and driven by the people of Sri Lanka, including 
        civil society and nongovernmental organizations;
Whereas progress on investigations into reports of war crimes, crimes against 
        humanity, and other human rights violations during the conflict and 
        promoting reconciliation would facilitate even greater United States 
        engagement, bilateral trade, and investment in Sri Lanka;
Whereas the United States is home to a large Sri Lankan diaspora, including 
        Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims, who have become an integral part of 
        American society;
Whereas Sri Lanka is strategically located at the nexus of maritime trading 
        routes connecting Europe and the Middle East to China and the rest of 
        Asia; and
Whereas the policy of the United States should be based on an integrated 
        strategy that improves economic and trade ties while supporting 
        initiatives that focus upon accountability and reconciliation as well as 
        the normalization of Sri Lankan military presence throughout the 
        country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the people of Sri Lanka for their commitment 
        to democracy and the democratic process;
            (2) commends President Sirisena and Prime Minister 
        Wickremesinghe for their commitment to peace, and 
        reconciliation for all Sri Lankans;
            (3) calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfill the 
        commitments it has made to all communities, ethnicities, and 
        religions, and under United Nations Human Rights Council 
        Resolution A/HRC/30/L.29;
            (4) supports Sri Lanka's continuing efforts to rid the 
        country of landmines remaining from the conflict and which kill 
        or maim innocent civilians;
            (5) supports the normalization of the military presence of 
        Sri Lanka;
            (6) supports the Sri Lankan Government in its efforts to 
        provide a peace dividend, to the people of Sri Lanka, including 
        by advancing accountability, reconciliation, devolution of 
        power, broad-based economic development and further integrating 
        the Sri Lankan economy into the global trading system; and
            (7) expresses support for United States assistance in the 
        development of Sri Lanka as it works to develop and diversify 
        the economy.
