                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for designation of June 2016 as ``National Gun 
                      Violence Awareness Month''.

Whereas annually on average 32,514 people die from gun violence;
Whereas annually on average over 108,000 people including 17,000 children in the 
        United States are shot in murders, assaults, suicides and suicide 
        attempts, unintentional shootings, or by police intervention;
Whereas annually on average 2,677 children die from gun violence;
Whereas on average 31 people in the United States are murdered with guns every 
        day and 151 are treated for a gun assault in an emergency room;
Whereas 1 in 3 people in the United States know someone who has been shot;
Whereas every day on average 55 people kill themselves with a firearm, and 46 
        people are shot or killed in an accident with a gun;
Whereas the United States firearm homicide rate is 20 times higher than the 
        combined rates of 22 countries that are our peers in wealth and 
        population;
Whereas a gun in the home is 22 times more likely to be used to kill or injure 
        in a domestic homicide, suicide, or unintentional shooting than to be 
        used in self-defense; and
Whereas June 2016 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National Gun 
        Violence Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Gun Violence 
        Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals of that month; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to--
                    (A) promote greater awareness about gun violence 
                and gun safety;
                    (B) concentrate annual heightened attention to gun 
                violence during the summer months, when gun violence 
                typically increases; and
                    (C) bring citizens and community leaders together 
                to discuss ways to make the communities safer.
                                 <all>
