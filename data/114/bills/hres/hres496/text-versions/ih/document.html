Whereas Computer Science is vital to the economy and quality of life in the 
        United States, making pivotal contributions to job creation and 
        innovation in manufacturing, health care, energy, education, and finance 
        and contributing to the effectiveness of the national defense of the 
        United States;
Whereas the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University was 
        among the first such departments founded in the Nation, created through 
        the leadership of Nobel laureate Herbert Simon and Turing Award winners 
        Allen Newell and Alan Perlis;
Whereas the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University has 
        distinguished itself in the fields of algorithms, programming languages, 
        software engineering, parallel processing, computer systems, and 
        software systems;
Whereas graduates of the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
        University have made significant contributions to academic research at 
        institutions across the United States and the world, as well as in the 
        growth and success of virtually all of the major information technology 
        companies of the United States; and
Whereas the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University has 
        applied advances in Computer Science to challenges ranging from 
        improving learning to enhancing the safety of the Nation's air traffic 
        control system, led the development of the Nation's first wired campus, 
        contributed to the economic revitalization of Pittsburgh through the 
        creation and attraction of new businesses, been home to 12 Turing Award 
        winners, and established nationally recognized initiatives for improving 
        diversity through its Women in Computer Science program: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the contributions of the Department of 
        Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University to the
