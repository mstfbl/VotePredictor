                               RESOLUTION


 
  Disapproving of President Obama and his administration's refusal to 
veto the anti-Israel resolution adopted by the United Nations Security 
                     Council on December 23, 2016.

Whereas the State of Israel has been a loyal friend and strong ally to the 
        United States since its establishment in 1948;
Whereas the United States Government has historically opposed and vetoed United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions that are one-sided and anti-Israel;
Whereas, on December 23, 2016, the United Nations Security Council adopted an 
        anti-Israel resolution that threatens peace in the Middle East and 
        breaks longstanding United States foreign policy; and
Whereas the United States Government, under the direction of President Barack 
        Obama, broke its longstanding commitment to the State of Israel, our 
        strongest ally in the Middle East, by refusing to veto this one-sided 
        and anti-Israel resolution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) disapproves of United Nations Security Council 
        Resolution 2334 adopted on December 23, 2016;
            (2) disapproves of President Barack Obama and his 
        administration's failure to veto this one-sided and anti-Israel 
        resolution;
            (3) affirms the United States Government in the future must 
        continue to oppose and veto United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions that are one-sided and anti-Israel;
            (4) affirms its commitment to the State of Israel as our 
        loyal friend and strong ally in the Middle East; and
            (5) affirms its commitment to work with future Presidents 
        to strengthen our alliance with the State of Israel.
                                 <all>
