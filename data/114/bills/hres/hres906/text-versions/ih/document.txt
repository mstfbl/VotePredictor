                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week during the period of 
                  October 23 through October 31, 2016.

Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was started to commemorate the service of 
        Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena;
Whereas, on February 7, 1985, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special 
        Agent Camarena was leaving his Guadalajara office to meet his wife for 
        lunch when five individuals forced him inside a car and sped off; he was 
        subsequently tortured at length and then murdered by members of the 
        local drug cartel;
Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally recognized since 1988 to 
        preserve the memory of Special Agent Camarena and further the cause for 
        which he gave his life;
Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign is the most longstanding drug prevention 
        program, bringing drug awareness to millions of people in the United 
        States each year;
Whereas State Governors and attorneys general, the National Family Partnership, 
        parent teacher associations, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Young 
        Marines, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and hundreds of other 
        organizations throughout the United States annually celebrate Red Ribbon 
        Week during the period of October 23 through October 31;
Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the creation of drug-free 
        communities through drug prevention efforts, education programs, 
        parental involvement, and community-wide support;
Whereas reducing the demand for controlled substances would curtail lethal 
        addictions and overdoses;
Whereas reducing the demand for controlled substances would reduce the violence 
        associated with drug trafficking, including, but not limited to, murders 
        and torture;
Whereas according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 2015 an 
        estimated 27.1 million Americans, or 10.1 percent of the population aged 
        12 and older, used illicit drugs;
Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges to securing a safe and healthy 
        future for people and families in the United States;
Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic violence and sexual 
        assault and place children at risk;
Whereas although public awareness of illicit drug use is increasing, emerging 
        drug threats and growing epidemics demand attention, with particular 
        focus on the nonmedical use of prescription drugs and synthetic drugs;
Whereas the majority of teenagers abusing prescription drugs get the drugs from 
        family, friends, and the home medicine cabinet;
Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration will host a National Take Back Day 
        on October 22, 2016, for the public to safely dispose of unused or 
        expired prescription drugs that can lead to accidental poisoning, 
        overdose, and abuse;
Whereas synthetic drugs, including those popularly known as ``K2'' or ``Spice'', 
        have acknowledged dangerous health effects and have become especially 
        popular among teens and young adults;
Whereas in 2014, poison centers across the United States responded to 
        approximately 4,247 calls related to synthetic drugs;
Whereas the 2016 National Drug Threat Survey revealed 45 percent of respondents 
        reported heroin was the greatest threat in their areas, more than any 
        other drug;
Whereas according to National Seizure System (NSS) data, heroin seizures in the 
        United States increased 80 percent over five years, from 3,733 kilograms 
        in 2011 to 6,722 kilograms in 2015;
Whereas the number of people reporting current heroin use nearly tripled between 
        2007 (161,000) and 2014 (435,000), according to the annual National 
        Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH);
Whereas fentanyl and its analogues have been devastating communities and 
        families at an unprecedented rate;
Whereas the National Forensic Laboratory Information System reported 13,002 
        fentanyl exhibits tested by forensic laboratories across the country in 
        2015, a 1,392 percent increase from the 934 fentanyl exhibits in 2013;
Whereas the presence of fentanyl has also posed a hazard to police officers and 
        agents;
Whereas the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data revealed 76 percent 
        of adolescents who admitted to treatment for substance abuse were 
        admitted for marijuana use; and
Whereas parents, young people, schools, businesses, law enforcement agencies, 
        religious institutions and faith-based organizations, service 
        organizations, senior citizens, medical and military personnel, sports 
        teams, and individuals throughout the United States will demonstrate 
        their commitment to healthy, productive, and drug-free lifestyles by 
        wearing and displaying red ribbons during this week-long celebration: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week;
            (2) encourages children, teens, and other individuals to 
        choose to live drug-free lives; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to promote 
        the creation of drug-free communities and to participate in 
        drug prevention activities to show support for healthy, 
        productive, and drug-free lifestyles.
                                 <all>
