                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing October 7th as National Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day.

Whereas Trigeminal Neuralgia is a disease that impacts men and women of all 
        ages, races, and ethnicities;
Whereas Trigeminal Neuralgia is typically diagnosed after the age of fifty, but 
        affects individuals of all ages, including children and infants;
Whereas it is estimated that 120,000 to 150,000 people are diagnosed with 
        Trigeminal Neuralgia every year;
Whereas Trigeminal Neuralgia is a neurological disease of the fifth cranial 
        nerve that alters the sensation of touch to the face, resulting in 
        excruciating pain;
Whereas the pain caused by the disease is of such intensity that Trigeminal 
        Neuralgia is also known as ``the suicide disease'' and ``the worst pain 
        known to man'';
Whereas Trigeminal Neuralgia is not directly inherited, though studies show that 
        genetic factors can indicate that certain individuals are susceptible to 
        the disease;
Whereas the exact cause of Trigeminal Neuralgia is still unknown;
Whereas, though some patients are helped by surgery, Trigeminal Neuralgia is 
        often unresponsive to surgical and pharmaceutical intervention, or the 
        benefit of those interventions are short-lived;
Whereas many sufferers and supporters of those with Trigeminal Neuralgia have 
        formed groups dedicated to providing education, support, and the raising 
        of funds for research, and the Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Facial 
        Pain Association having spearheaded the implementation of a Trigeminal 
        Neuralgia Awareness Day;
Whereas these organizations are dedicated not only to educating the public, the 
        medical community, and patients, but also to raising funds for direly 
        needed research into the causes and potential cures of Trigeminal 
        Neuralgia;
Whereas additional funding and research can enable those individuals disabled by 
        this disorder to live to their fullest potential again;
Whereas the goals of Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day are to invite 
        individuals to join the movement to end Trigeminal Neuralgia, to 
        encourage individuals to demonstrate a commitment to moving toward a 
        world free of Trigeminal Neuralgia, and to acknowledge the individuals 
        who have dedicated their time and talent to promote research and 
        programs to end Trigeminal Neuralgia; and
Whereas this year and every year hereafter October 7th is recognized as 
        Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Trigeminal Neuralgia 
        Awareness Day;
            (2) encourages States, territories, possessions of the 
        United States, and localities to support the goals and 
        interests of Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day by issuing 
        proclamations designating Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day;
            (3) encourages media organizations to participate in 
        Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day and help provide education 
        to the public about Trigeminal Neuralgia;
            (4) commends the efforts of the States, territories, and 
        possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
        ideals of Trigeminal Neuralgia Awareness Day;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
        States to ending Trigeminal Neuralgia by promoting--
                    (A) awareness about individuals who are affected by 
                Trigeminal Neuralgia; and
                    (B) education programs, supporting research, and 
                expanding access to medical treatment;
            (6) recognizes the pain which all individuals in the United 
        States with Trigeminal Neuralgia suffer;
            (7) expresses gratitude to the family members and friends 
        of individuals living with Trigeminal Neuralgia, who are a 
        source of love and encouragement to those individuals; and
            (8) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
        researchers who--
                    (A) provide assistance to those individuals 
                affected by Trigeminal Neuralgia; and
                    (B) continue to work to find ways to end Trigeminal 
                Neuralgia forever.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
