        thousands of Ecuadorians have gone missing;
Whereas the earthquake damaged or destroyed homes, hospitals, roads, and 
        businesses;
Whereas the United Nations indicates that tens of thousands of people are 
        sheltering in evacuation centers;
Whereas the earthquake has knocked out electricity and water to multiple 
        communities;

        the people of Ecuador in this difficult time and are ready to assist in 
        any way we can.'';
Whereas according to the United States Census Bureau approximately 700,000 
        Ecuadorian-Americans reside in the United States;
