                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the national Job Corps program as 
     it celebrates 50 years of educating and training the Nation's 
                   economically disadvantaged youth.

Whereas over the course of 50 years, nearly 3,000,000 youth in the United States 
        have been provided a safe living and learning environment on Job Corps 
        campuses nationwide;
Whereas 126 Job Corps campuses educate and train 50,000 youth in the United 
        States each year;
Whereas throughout its 5 decades of existence, Job Corps has successfully 
        provided the Nation's jobless and under-educated youth with critical 
        residential, academic, and career preparation services;
Whereas Job Corps is considered the Nation's largest and most successful high 
        school dropout recovery and youth empowerment program;
Whereas youth enrolled in Job Corps receive intensive academic remediation, 
        gainful employment, life-learning skills, and job placement assistance;
Whereas Job Corps builds the lives of its students, many of whom are high school 
        dropouts and have never held a full-time job;
Whereas in an average 10-month stay at Job Corps campuses, the majority of youth 
        improve their literacy by more than 2 grade levels, leave with a high 
        school diploma equivalency, and nearly 80 percent of Job Corps graduates 
        secure employment or enter the military;
Whereas Job Corps successful model of preparing youth in the United States has 
        included strong partnerships and linkages with employers and labor 
        representatives;
Whereas this public-private partnership of United States ingenuity has led to 
        local and large employers and labor representatives providing Job Corps 
        students with hands-on, practical experience and the smooth transition 
        from student to employee;
Whereas Job Corps successful business model has relied on marketplace 
        competition to identify the most qualified operators that are capable of 
        securing the best outcomes for our youth and the best value for 
        taxpayers;
Whereas Job Corps students and staff have contributed to their communities 
        through millions of hours of community service, signaling the importance 
        of giving back to the communities in which they live;
Whereas dedicated Job Corps staff invest their time and talents in the lives of 
        students and without whom Job Corps could not fulfill its mission;
Whereas the economic benefits of each local Job Corps center is the generation 
        of 100 permanent jobs, thus producing 15,000 qualified and dedicated 
        staff in 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and
Whereas 2015 marks the 50th anniversary of the national Job Corps program in 
        honor of Job Corps graduates, students, staff and campus operators, 
        local employers, and community supporters across America: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the 50th 
anniversary of the national Job Corps program.
                                 <all>
