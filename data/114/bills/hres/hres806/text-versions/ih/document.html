                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing condolences for the killing of the British Member of 
                        Parliament (MP) Jo Cox.

Whereas, on June 16, 2016, British Member of Parliament Helen Joanne ``Jo'' Cox 
        while traveling to meet with constituents in Birstall was attacked and 
        sustained fatal injuries in an abhorrent act of terrorism;
Whereas as a result of these injuries Cox passed away at the age of 41;
Whereas Cox was a faithful servant who dedicated her life to helping those in 
        need through a lifetime of advocacy and work for humanitarian causes;
Whereas Cox was a faithful public servant who dedicated her life to serving the 
        British people and expanded protections for some of the world's most 
        vulnerable populations, especially refugees;
Whereas she was the first in her family to graduate from a university, Pembroke 
        College at Cambridge, where she received a degree in social and 
        political studies;
Whereas Cox had just been elected in May 2015 for her first term as a Member of 
        the Parliament for Bateley & Spen;
Whereas when Cox was elected to Parliament she said that she had achieved her 
        ``dream'';
Whereas at the time of her death, Cox was about to meet with her constituents;
Whereas President Barack Obama described Cox as ``an effective public servant 
        for her beloved Yorkshire'' and made clear that ``countless women, 
        children and refugees around the world live with more dignity and home 
        because they knew Jo Cox and were touched by her work on their behalf'';
Whereas British Prime Minister David Cameron described Cox as ``a voice of 
        compassion, whose irrepressible spirit and boundless energy lit up the 
        lives of all who knew her and saved the lives of many she never, ever 
        met'';
Whereas Cox was nominated as a Young Global Leader by the Davos World Economic 
        Forum in 2009;
Whereas Cox described herself as a ``mum, proud Yorkshire lass, boat dweller, 
        mountain climber and former aid worker'';
Whereas Cox truly sought to improve her community through public service;
Whereas the British Parliament was recalled to pay tribute to Cox and flags were 
        flown at half-staff over the Prime Minister's residence, Number 10 
        Downing Street;
Whereas the loss of innocent lives due to political violence in the United 
        Kingdom is a threat to the United States and democratic governments 
        across the world; and
Whereas Cox leaves behind her husband, Brendan, and two children, Cuillin and 
        Leijla: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the killing of Member 
        of Parliament Jo Cox on June 16, 2016;
            (2) condemns in the strongest terms acts of terrorism;
            (3) expresses its deepest sympathies to the Cox family for 
        their loss; and
            (4) stands with the British Parliament and the British 
        people during this profound moment of sadness.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
