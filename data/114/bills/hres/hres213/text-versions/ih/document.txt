                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning the April 2015 terrorist attack at the Garissa University 
 College in Garissa, Kenya, and reaffirming the United States support 
    for the people and Government of Kenya, and for other purposes.

Whereas, on April 2, 2015, armed terrorists attacked the Garissa University 
        College in Garissa, Kenya, taking hundreds of students hostage, killing 
        at least 147 people, many of whom were specifically targeted for being 
        non-Muslim, and injuring more than 100 others during an almost 12-hour 
        siege;
Whereas the attack was the deadliest terrorist incident in Kenya since the 1998 
        bombing of the United States embassy by al Qaeda, and the deadliest 
        attack by al Shabaab since its 2013 attack on the Westgate Mall;
Whereas al Shabaab, a Somali Islamist extremist group with ties to al Qaeda, has 
        claimed responsibility for the attack, declaring that it was in 
        retaliation for the Government of Kenya's participation in the African 
        Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM);
Whereas al Shabaab was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United 
        States Government in 2008 and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist 
        entity by the United States Government in 2012;
Whereas several of the attackers were killed, and others connected to the attack 
        were arrested, and the investigation to identify the architect(s) of the 
        attack and efforts to bring them to justice are ongoing;
Whereas Kenya is an important ally and regional security partner, playing a 
        vital role in breaking al Shabaab's stranglehold on Somalia through its 
        participation in AMISOM;
Whereas the Republic of Kenya and the United States have a strong and enduring 
        partnership based on a shared commitment to promote peace and prosperity 
        in East Africa and around the world; and
Whereas Kenya is a culturally rich and ethnically diverse country: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous 
        atrocities and terrorist attack that occurred at Garissa 
        University College in Garissa, Kenya, on April 2, 2015;
            (2) offers its condolences to the families, friends, and 
        loved ones of those who were killed in the attack and expresses 
        its hope for the recovery of the wounded;
            (3) recognizes the many heroic and selfless acts by Kenyan 
        citizens, first responders, and the Kenya Red Cross to rescue 
        those caught in the Garissa University College attack;
            (4) condemns al Shabaab's apparent effort to foment 
        divisions among the Kenyan people along religious lines;
            (5) reaffirms United States support for the efforts of the 
        Government and people of Kenya to combat terrorism, counter 
        extremism, promote tolerance, and bring all the perpetrators of 
        the Garissa University College attack to justice;
            (6) commends the Government of Kenya's continued 
        participation in the African Union Mission in Somalia;
            (7) urges Kenya to maintain its commitment to protecting 
        Somali refugees who are fleeing the horrors of al Shabaab; and
            (8) recognizes Kenya as an important regional ally and 
        partner of the United States.
