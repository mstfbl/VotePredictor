                               RESOLUTION


 
   Reaffirming the right for the United States to use all available 
  options, including the use of military force, to prevent Iran from 
                      acquiring a nuclear weapon.

Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, poses a 
        serious threat to the safety and security of the United States and its 
        allies throughout the world, and regularly commits deplorable violations 
        of human rights;
Whereas the acquisition of a nuclear weapon by Iran would pose an immediate and 
        profound threat to the United States, Israel, and the Middle East, by 
        enabling it to act with impunity;
Whereas the Government of Iran has called for the destruction of the State of 
        Israel, our most important ally in the Middle East bound by historic, 
        economic, and military ties;
Whereas Iran has provided terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah 
        with weapons and technology used to threaten Israel and Israeli 
        civilians as well as committed destabilizing actions in other 
        neighboring countries;
Whereas Iran has propped up the Assad regime in Syria, which has killed more 
        than 200,000 people through deliberate attacks on civilians and which 
        has resulted in the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II with 
        the displacement of roughly 12,000,000 Syrian refugees;
Whereas the acquisition of a nuclear weapon by Iran would lead to a nuclear arms 
        race and proliferation of nuclear capabilities throughout the Middle 
        East, undermining efforts by the international community to bring peace 
        and stability to an already volatile part of the world;
Whereas Iran has a history of dishonesty with regards to its nuclear program;
Whereas one United States citizen has disappeared in Iran;
Whereas, on May 22, 2015, the President signed into law the Iran Nuclear 
        Agreement Review Act of 2015 to continue the robust role of 
        congressional oversight of United States policy to prevent Iran from 
        acquiring a nuclear weapon;
Whereas, on July 14, 2015, Iran and the P5+1 countries of the United States, 
        France, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, the 
        United Kingdom, and Germany agreed to a Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
        Action to block Iran's path towards obtaining a nuclear weapon;
Whereas, on October 10, 2015, and November 21, 2015, Iran test-launched a 
        medium-range ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear weapon in 
        clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929; and
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which became effective on 
        October 18, 2015, conditions financial sanctions relief on Iran's 
        ability to comply with intrusive and transparent inspections of its 
        nuclear program, the removal of thousands of centrifuges, the reduction 
        of its enriched uranium stockpile, and other measures to hold Iran to 
        account: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms the right for the United States to use all 
        available options, including the use of military force, to 
        prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon;
            (2) reaffirms that it is the policy of the United States to 
        prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon for the life of 
        the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and afterward;
            (3) expresses its concern over the lack of clarity from the 
        Administration with regards to its response in the event of 
        minor or incremental violations by Iran of the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action;
            (4) makes clear its unwavering support for Israel's right 
        to ensure its survival and to defend itself from nations and 
        non-state actors that wish to do it harm;
            (5) calls on the Administration to provide Israel with 
        military and intelligence support and cooperation to confront 
        new threats to Israel's security by maintaining its strategic 
        and qualitative military edge through--
                    (A) transferring to the Government of Israel, as 
                appropriate and consistent with United States treaty 
                obligations, ordnance and delivery systems under such 
                terms and conditions as the President determines 
                necessary to effectively deter conventional, 
                unconventional, and nuclear threats from Iran and 
                ensure that Israeli personnel have the opportunity and 
                means to train with such defense systems, including 
                joint training exercises;
                    (B) fulfilling the requirements of the War Reserves 
                Stock Allies-Israel pursuant to the Foreign Assistance 
                Act of 1961 for the pre-positioned storage of United 
                States weapons in emergency situations;
                    (C) supporting missile defense programs, including 
                the Iron Dome Weapon System, the David's Sling Weapon 
                System, Upper Tier Interceptor, and Arrow-3 Weapon;
                    (D) identifying and advancing collaborative 
                research between the United States and Israel in the 
                development of an anti-tunneling defense system to 
                detect, map, and destroy underground tunnels used by 
                Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorist groups to 
                threaten the lives of Israeli civilians; and
                    (E) finalizing negotiations on a new 10-year 
                Memorandum of Understanding on providing additional 
                foreign military financing to Israel;
            (6) calls on all United Nations member states to take all 
        necessary measures to prevent the transfer of ballistic or 
        cruise missile technology or technical assistance to Iran 
        related to such activities;
            (7) calls on the President to engage with Congress and 
        international partners to ensure that the International Atomic 
        Energy Agency receives the full additional $10,600,000 per year 
        necessary to fulfill its verification responsibilities under 
        the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or any other related 
        agreement;
            (8) supports the full funding of the Department of State's 
        Coordinator for Iran Nuclear Implementation to ensure thorough 
        and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
        Action and calls for the Coordinator to regularly report to 
        Congress on the status of Iranian compliance or non-compliance 
        with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;
            (9) supports the full funding of the Department of the 
        Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to ensure strict 
        enforcement of sanctions against Iranian actors in the areas of 
        ballistic or cruise missile proliferation and terrorism and to 
        ensure effective re-imposition of sanctions in the event of any 
        violation or breach of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;
            (10) remains committed to confronting the Iranian regime's 
        destabilizing actions in the Middle East through increased 
        cooperation with United States regional partners;
            (11) demands immediate action by the Administration to 
        raise Iran's recent ballistic missile testing with the United 
        Nations Security Council and seek an appropriate response for 
        Iran's disregard for complying with United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 1929;
            (12) calls on the Iranian Government to assist in the 
        investigation of the disappearance of United States citizens 
        within its borders;
            (13) condemns Iran's reprehensible record of human rights 
        violations and supports the Iranian people's pursuit of civil 
        liberties;
            (14) reaffirms that nothing in the Joint Comprehensive Plan 
        of Action limits or curtails the ability of Congress to pass 
        sanctions legislation to address future Iranian terrorism 
        activities, ballistic or cruise missile development, human 
        rights abuses, or to reauthorize existing sanctions that are 
        not lifted under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;
            (15) strongly urges the Administration to continue to 
        enforce non-nuclear sanctions, including sanctions relating to 
        human rights violations and support for terrorist 
        organizations;
            (16) calls on the Administration to continue to keep 
        Congress regularly informed through briefings, hearings, and 
        reports about how it will work with other P5+1 countries to 
        clarify, address, and implement a response to any and all 
        violations of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; and
            (17) calls for the creation of a bipartisan Iran Study 
        Group composed of senior and expert policy-makers to report to 
        Congress on a broader Middle East strategy to counter Iran and 
        leverage more constructive Iranian behavior.
