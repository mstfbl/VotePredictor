Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 25th 
                 anniversary of democracy in Mongolia.

Whereas the United States Government established diplomatic relations with the 
        Government of Mongolia in January 1987;
Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mongolia declared an end to a one-party, 
        authoritarian, Communist political system and adopted a lasting, 
        multiparty democracy and free market reforms;
Whereas the Government of Mongolia has demonstrated a commitment to democracy 
        and continues to strengthen democratic institutions in Mongolia;
Whereas the Government of Mongolia is an important leader in, and model for, the 
        successful and peaceful transition to democracy;
Whereas Mongolia successfully chaired the Community of Democracies, which was 
        held in Ulaanbaatar in 2013, and sponsored a United Nations General 
        Assembly resolution entitled ``Education for Democracy'' (United Nations 
        General Assembly Resolution 69/268 (2015)) to promote democratic 
        institutions, civic life, and human rights;
Whereas President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has stated that Mongolia is willing to 
        serve as ``a center of democracy education, a life model for challenges 
        and opportunities of freedom'';
Whereas Mongolia is committed to freedom of expression and other basic human 
        rights, becoming the first country in Asia to chair the Freedom Online 
        Coalition and hosting the annual Freedom Online conference in 
        Ulaanbaatar in May 2015;
Whereas Mongolia will host the 11th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit in 2016 in 
        Ulaanbaatar, which will bring together European and Asian countries in 
        an informal dialogue to address political, economic, social, cultural, 
        and educational issues, with the objective of strengthening the 
        relationship between the two regions in a spirit of mutual respect and 
        equal partnership;
Whereas the Government of Mongolia established an International Cooperation Fund 
        to share experiences and to support the advance of democracy and 
        democratic values in other emerging nations, including Kyrgyzstan, 
        Afghanistan, and Burma; and
Whereas the United States Government has a longstanding commitment, because of 
        the interests and values of the United States, to encourage economic and 
        political reforms in Mongolia: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the people and the Government of Mongolia 
        on the 25th anniversary of the first democratic elections in 
        Mongolia;
            (2) commends Mongolia for a peaceful and successful 
        democratic transition;
            (3) expresses support for the continued efforts of the 
        Government of Mongolia to promote democracy, transparency, rule 
        of law, and other shared values between Mongolia and the United 
        States;
            (4) acknowledges the shared interest of the United States 
        Government and the Government of Mongolia in promoting peace 
        and stability in Northeast and Central Asia;
            (5) recognizes the role of Mongolia as a global leader for 
        emerging democracies;
            (6) recognizes that the United States should continue to 
        support actions taken by the Government of Mongolia to--
                    (A) further develop democratic institutions; and
                    (B) promote transparency, accountability, and 
                community engagement; and
            (7) recommends that the United States Government expand 
        academic, cultural, and other people-to-people partnerships 
        between Mongolia and the United States.
