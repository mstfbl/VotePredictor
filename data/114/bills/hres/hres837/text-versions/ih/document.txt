Whereas Chuck Brown, who was born on August 22, 1936, and passed away on May 16,

        life;
Whereas Chuck Brown, who taught himself to play guitar, became a virtuoso 
        singer, songwriter, guitarist, and band leader;
Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go beat gave the District of Columbia a musical

        Marvin Gaye;
Whereas Chuck Brown's musical catalogue spans 22 studio albums over 3 decades;

Whereas Chuck Brown earned a Grammy nomination in 2010 for the song ``Love'',

Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go has been passed from generation to generation with 
        undiminished popularity;
Whereas Chuck Brown influenced jazz, rap, and go-go musicians such as the bands 
        Trouble Funk, Rare Essence, and Experience Unlimited (also known as 
        E.U.);
Whereas Chuck Brown was so committed to securing statehood and equal voting 
        rights for the residents of the District of Columbia that he played a 
        concert on a very hot, humid day on the Capitol grounds in 2010;
Whereas the District of Columbia has named a street near the historic, 
        modernized Howard Theatre for Chuck Brown;

Whereas August 22, 2015, is Chuck Brown's birthday: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Chuck Brown Day'', and honors Chuck Brown's 
contributions to music and to the District of Columbia.
