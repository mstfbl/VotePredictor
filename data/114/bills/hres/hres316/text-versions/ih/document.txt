 Observing the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day.

Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the frontier areas of the 
        United States, in particular the State of Texas and other Southwestern 
        States, until months after the conclusion of the Civil War, more than 2 
        and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation 
        Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863;
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, 
        upon landing in Galveston, Texas, issued General Order Number 3, 
        pronouncing all slaves free, including absolute equality of personal 
        rights;
Whereas for 150 years, Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations have been held 
        to honor African-American freedom while encouraging self-development and 
        respect for all cultures;
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves and 
        their descendants remain an example for all people of the United States, 
        regardless of background, religion, or race; and
Whereas over the course of its history, the United States has grown into a 
        symbol of democracy and freedom around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth 
        Independence Day to the Nation;
            (2) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth 
        Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of 
        the United States to learn more about the past and to better 
        understand the experiences that have shaped the Nation;
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs;
            (4) recognizes that the celebration of the end of slavery 
        is an important and enriching part of the history and heritage 
        of the United States; and
            (5) respectfully requests that the Clerk of the House 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the National 
        Juneteenth Observance Foundation (NJOF) in appreciation of 
        support given to the recognition of Juneteenth Independence 
        Day.
                                 <all>
