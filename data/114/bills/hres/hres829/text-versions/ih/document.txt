                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for completion of President Obama's Export Control 
 Reform Initiative, which will fundamentally reform the United States 
   export control system and enhance United States national security.

Whereas the United States export control system is highly flawed and limits the 
        competitiveness of American businesses in the global marketplace;
Whereas the United States export control system currently is enforced by 
        multiple overlapping agencies utilizing separate and often redundant 
        information technology systems;
Whereas President Obama undertook an interagency review of the United States 
        export control system in 2009 with the goal of doubling United States 
        exports within 5 years;
Whereas review of the Bureau of Industry and Security's Commerce Control List 
        and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls' United States Munitions 
        List is part of phase one of President Obama's Export Control Reform 
        Initiative;
Whereas 18 of the 21 categories on the United States Munitions List have begun 
        the transition from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense 
        Trade Controls to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and 
        Security's Commerce Control List;
Whereas the remaining 3 categories still remain under regulation by the 
        Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls with no 
        indication of movement since 2013;
Whereas the remaining 3 categories represent an opportunity to increase United 
        States competition in a rapidly increasing global marketplace and grow 
        United States exports without impacting national security; and
Whereas American manufacturers face a competitive disadvantage, which limits the 
        ability of manufacturers to grow their businesses here at home: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports President Obama's Export Control Reform 
        Initiative;
            (2) recognizes the economic burden imposed on those United 
        States Munitions List categories that remain unnecessarily 
        regulated by the Department of State's Directorate of Defense 
        Trade Controls; and
            (3) encourages publication of proposed rules to shift the 
        remaining United States Munitions List categories to the 
        Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security's 
        Commerce Control List by the end of 2016.
                                 <all>
