Recognizing Dr. Elmira Mangum as the first female president of Florida 
                 Agricultural & Mechanical University.

Whereas Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University (FAMU) was founded on 
        October 3, 1887, as the State Normal College for Colored Students at 
        Tallahassee with 15 students and 2 instructors;
Whereas FAMU was established as an 1890 land-grant institution dedicated to the 
        advancement of knowledge, resolution of complex issues, and the 
        empowerment of citizens and communities;
Whereas the institution has gone by 3 other names prior to becoming Florida 
        Agricultural & Mechanical University (FAMU) in 1953, and remains the 
        only historically black university in the 12-member State University 
        System of Florida;
Whereas FAMU students have a legacy of social involvement, including the boycott 
        of Tallahassee buses that successfully integrated the city's public 
        transportation system;
Whereas FAMU now boasts approximately 11,000 students and 700 faculty members, 
        and has had 10 men serve as presidents during the institution's 127-year 
        history;
Whereas Dr. Elmira Mangum has a 28-year history as a higher education 
        administrator, ranging from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the 
        University of Buffalo to the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill 
        and Cornell University;
Whereas Dr. Mangum holds a Master's in Public Policy and Public Administration, 
        a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning, and a Ph.D. in Educational 
        Leadership and Policy;
Whereas Dr. Mangum has taught higher education administration, leadership theory 
        and practice, and financial management;
Whereas Dr. Mangum was in the inaugural class of the Millennium Leadership 
        Institute, attended the Harvard Graduate School of Education Management 
        Development Program, and Cornell's Administrative Management Institute;
Whereas Dr. Mangum is a life member of the National Council of Negro Women and 
        Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., a historically black Greek-lettered 
        organization that promotes scholarship, sisterly love, service, and 
        finer womanhood;
Whereas Dr. Mangum was selected as the first permanent female president in the 
        127-year history of FAMU;
Whereas Dr. Mangum has made tremendous strides to advance the legacy of FAMU 
        with forward thinking plans, such as her Sustainability Initiative, 
        which will provide research-based solutions to the world's socio-
        economic and environmental problems, and strengthening FAMU's STEM 
        programs, which are the hallmark of academia;
Whereas Dr. Mangum has consistently articulated resourceful, innovative ideas 
        for Black college survival; and
Whereas our Nation must remain committed to celebrating the accomplishments and 
        advancements of women: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes Dr. Elmira Mangum for being selected as the 
        first female permanent president of Florida Agricultural & 
        Mechanical University;
