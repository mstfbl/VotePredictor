                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of the designation of January 1, 2015, 
   to December 31, 2024, as the ``International Decade for People of 
                           African Descent''.

Whereas the decade commencing on January 1, 2015, and ending on December 31, 
        2024, has been designated as the ``International Decade for People of 
        African Descent'' with the theme ``People of African descent: 
        recognition, justice and development'';
Whereas the African Diaspora is expansive, spanning across the globe from Latin 
        America and the Caribbean to Asia and Europe, with persons of African 
        descent having had a historical presence and currently residing on every 
        continent;
Whereas during the ``International Decade for People of African Descent'' 
        governments and civil society across the globe join together with people 
        of African descent to promote respect, protection, and the fulfilment of 
        human rights and fundamental freedoms;
Whereas during the ``International Decade for People of African Descent'' 
        governments in concert with civil society are to strengthen national, 
        regional and international action and cooperation to facilitate the full 
        and equal participation of people of African descent in society, promote 
        a greater knowledge of and respect for the diverse heritage, culture and 
        contributions of people of African descent to the development of 
        societies, and to strengthen and implement legal frameworks that combat 
        racial discrimination;
Whereas during the ``International Decade for People of African Descent'' 
        governments are to utilize reliable statistical data to develop and 
        implement in concert with civil society measurable national action plans 
        and other strategies to address racial disparities impacting People of 
        African descent in the justice, wealth, education, employment, health, 
        housing, development, and other sectors;
Whereas government efforts of the ``International Decade for People of African 
        Descent'' are to also promote the history and heritage of people of 
        African descent, including through research and education, the full and 
        accurate inclusion of their history and contributions in educational 
        curricula, and by recognizing the victims and descendants of the 
        transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, as a means of upholding their 
        human dignity and equality and promoting societal reconciliation and 
        healing;
Whereas government efforts of the ``International Decade for People of African 
        Descent'' are to also enable the full, equal and effective participation 
        of people of African descent in public and political affairs; and
Whereas, on December 10, 2014, Ambassador Samantha Power, United States 
        Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the General Assembly 
        Special Event on the International Decade for People of African Descent 
        stated, ``The United States comes to the International Decade for People 
        of African Descent with a full and robust commitment to ensuring the 
        rights of persons of African descent, and to combating racism and 
        discrimination against them.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the ``International 
        Decade for People of African Descent'';
            (2) recalls S. Con. Res. 26 supporting the goals and ideals 
        of the designation of the International Year for People of 
        African Descent;
            (3) supports the establishment of a global affairs strategy 
        and assistance for people of African descent;
            (4) supports the expansion of current efforts by the United 
        Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
        Organization for American States, and other international 
        organizations to address the human rights situation of People 
        of African Descent;
            (5) calls upon the United States in cooperation with civil 
        society (African descent communities, academics, activists, 
        businesses, and philanthropic organizations) to develop and 
        implement domestic and global strategies to execute the goals 
        and ideals of the ``International Decade for People of African 
        Descent'' and to combat racism, including by expanding the 
        transformative work of the United States Department of State's 
        Race, Ethnicity, and Social Inclusion Unit in this regard; and
            (6) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to combat racism, 
        discrimination, and intolerance in the United States and around 
        the globe.
