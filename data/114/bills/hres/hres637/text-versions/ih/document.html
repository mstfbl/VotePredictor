                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
 States should establish a national goal of more than 50 percent clean 
 and carbon free electricity by 2030 for the purposes of avoiding the 
 worst impacts of climate change, growing our economy, increasing our 
shared prosperity, improving public health, and preserving our national 
                               security.

Whereas failing to act on climate change will have a devastating impact on our 
        Nation's economy, costing us billions of dollars in lost GDP;
Whereas extreme weather, intensified by climate change, has already cost 
        taxpayers billions of dollars each year in recovery efforts, and this 
        will only continue if climate change is left unaddressed;
Whereas decreased economic growth and increased costs from infrastructure 
        repairs and other recovery efforts due to climate change will 
        significantly increase budget deficits and undermine our fiscal 
        stability;
Whereas climate change will have devastating public health implications, 
        including increased asthma attacks and exacerbation of other respiratory 
        diseases, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children and 
        low-income communities, the spread of infectious diseases, risks to food 
        and water supplies, and increased premature deaths;
Whereas inaction on climate change will disproportionately impact communities of 
        color and exacerbate existing economic inequalities;
Whereas the Department of Defense has identified climate change as a ``threat 
        multiplier'' that will increase global instability and conflict;
Whereas the transition to a clean energy economy is feasible with existing 
        technology;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will create millions of jobs;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will increase our country's GDP and 
        increase disposable household income;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will save billions of dollars in 
        avoidable health costs;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will save lives and improve public 
        health;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will lower energy bills for businesses 
        and families;
Whereas the transition to clean energy will help the United States achieve its 
        international emissions reduction commitment to reduce greenhouse gas 
        emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025; and
Whereas the transition to clean energy will unlock billions of dollars in 
        private investment: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should--
            (1) establish a national goal of more than 50 percent clean 
        and carbon free electricity by 2030; and
            (2) enact legislation to accelerate the transition to clean 
        energy to meet this goal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
