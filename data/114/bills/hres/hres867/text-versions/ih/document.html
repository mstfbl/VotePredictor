                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of September 2016 as ``National 
                         Kinship Care Month''.

Whereas in September 2016, ``National Kinship Care Month'' is observed;
Whereas nationally 2,700,000 children are living in kinship care with 
        grandparents or other relatives;
Whereas grandparents and relatives residing in urban, rural, and suburban 
        households in every county of the United States have stepped forward out 
        of love and loyalty to care for children during times in which 
        biological parents are unable to do so;
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, promote well-being, and establish 
        stable households for vulnerable children;
Whereas kinship care enables a child--

    (1) to maintain family relationships and cultural heritage; and

    (2) to remain in the community of the child;

Whereas kinship care is a national resource that provides loving homes for 
        children at risk;
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting challenges to keep countless children 
        from entering foster care;
Whereas the House of Representatives is proud to recognize the many kinship care 
        families in which a child is raised by grandparents or other relatives;
Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to honor the many kinship caregivers 
        who throughout the history of the United States have provided loving 
        homes for parentless children;
Whereas National Kinship Care Month provides an opportunity to urge people in 
        every State to join in recognizing and celebrating kinship caregiving 
        families and the tradition of families in the United States to help 
        raise children; and
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, 
        nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Kinship Care 
        Month'';
            (2) encourages Congress to implement policies to improve 
        the lives of vulnerable children and families;
            (3) honors the commitment and dedication of kinship 
        caregivers and the advocates and allies who work tirelessly to 
        provide assistance and services to kinship caregiving families; 
        and
            (4) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the 
        outcomes of all vulnerable children through parts B and E of 
        title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 
        and other programs designed--
                    (A) to support vulnerable families;
                    (B) to invest in prevention and reunification 
                services; and
                    (C) to ensure that extended family members who take 
                on the role of kinship caregivers receive the necessary 
                support.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
