                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
appropriate award of the Purple Heart to the Marines and Sailors killed 
or wounded in the recent attack at the Navy Operational Support Center 
 and Marine Corps Reserve Center and the Armed Forces Career Center in 
                        Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Whereas, on July 16, 2015, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez launched a heavily armed 
        attack against members of the Armed Forces serving at the Navy 
        Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center and the Armed 
        Forces Career Center in Chattanooga, Tennessee;
Whereas Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan, Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson A. 
        Holmquist, Lance Cpl. Squire Wells, and Petty Officer 2nd Class Randall 
        Smith were killed in the attack upon the Navy Operational Support Center 
        and Marine Corps Reserve Center;
Whereas Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, the perpetrator of the attack, was inspired 
        and motivated by the teachings and actions of known members of foreign 
        terrorist organizations recognized by the Department of State; and
Whereas section 1129a of title 10, United States Code, as added by section 571 
        of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291; 128 Stat. 
        3387), recognized circumstances under which a member of the Armed Forces 
        on active duty who is killed or wounded in an attack by a foreign 
        terrorist organization, or an individual or entity in communication with 
        a foreign terrorist organization, is eligible for the award of the 
        Purple Heart: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the July 16, 2015, attack upon members of the Armed 
        Forces at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps 
        Reserve Center and the Armed Forces Career Center in 
        Chattanooga, Tennessee, clearly meets the criteria established 
        by section 1129a of title 10, United States Code, for the award 
        of the Purple Heart to members of the Armed Forces killed or 
        wounded in the attack; and
            (2) the Secretary of the Navy should award the Purple Heart 
        under such section to the members of the Marine Corps and Navy 
        who were killed or wounded in the attack.
                                 <all>
