                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the cowardly attack on innocent men, women, and children in 
                the northeastern Nigerian town of Baga.

Whereas, on the night of January 3, 2015, the terrorist group Boko Haram 
        launched a cowardly attack on innocent men, women, and children in the 
        northeastern Nigerian town of Baga;
Whereas the terrorists of Boko Haram used assault rifles, grenade launchers, and 
        fire to slaughter innocent civilians;
Whereas the scope of casualties in this attack totals in the hundreds and 
        possibly thousands;
Whereas most of the victims of this attack were women, children, and elderly 
        people;
Whereas Amnesty International describes the attack as the terrorist group's 
        ``deadliest massacre'' to date;
Whereas local defense groups are reported to have given up counting the bodies 
        left lying on the streets of Baga;
Whereas these unprovoked attacks have resulted in many Nigerians being not 
        likely to vote in the upcoming Presidential elections;
Whereas human rights groups have indicated that the Nigerian state security 
        forces should improve efforts to protect civilians during offensive 
        operations against Boko Haram;
Whereas numerous reports have indicated security forces in the region are 
        fleeing when confronted by Boko Haram;
Whereas Boko Haram now reportedly controls Baga and 16 neighboring towns in 
        northeastern Nigeria;
Whereas this terrorist group killed 10,000 people in Nigeria alone in 2014; and
Whereas Boko Haram has displaced over 1,000,000 innocent people: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its strong support for the people of Nigeria, 
        especially the men, women, and children in the northeastern 
        Nigerian town of Baga who were victimized, abducted, 
        trafficked, and murdered by the terrorist group Boko Haram;
            (2) condemns Boko Haram for its violent attacks on civilian 
        targets, including schools, mosques, churches, villages, and 
        agricultural centers in Nigeria;
            (3) encourages the Government of Nigeria to strengthen 
        efforts to protect civilians from the terrorists of Boko Haram;
            (4) supports offers of United States assistance to the 
        Government of Nigeria in the search for the school girls 
        abducted by Boko Haram; and
            (5) encourages the Government of Nigeria to work with the 
        United States, and other governments in the region such as 
        Chad, Niger, and Cameroon, to defeat Boko Haram.
