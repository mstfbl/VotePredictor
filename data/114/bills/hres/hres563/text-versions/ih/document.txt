 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
  States and the Republic of Belarus should establish full diplomatic 
                               relations.

Whereas the Republic of Belarus released all of its political prisoners on 
        August 22, 2015, which resulted in a temporary lifting of sanctions by 
        both the European Union and the United States;
Whereas Belarus has played a constructive role by hosting talks which have 
        resulted in a cease fire agreement in eastern Ukraine;
Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) election 
        observation team tasked with monitoring the Republic of Belarus' October 
        15, 2015, elections noted progress in their democratic development;
Whereas the United States Department of State has been engaged with Belarus in 
        developing democratic institutions and a functioning civil society;
Whereas the United States recognizes the Republic of Belarus' role in and 
        encourages deeper cooperation with a variety of international 
        organizations, including the United Nations, the Euro-Atlantic 
        Partnership Council, OSCE, the International Monetary Fund, and the 
        World Bank;
Whereas the United States is committed to developing a positive diplomatic 
        relationship with the Republic of Belarus and its citizens; and
Whereas the United States welcomes the improved conduct of the October national 
        elections including the presence of international election observers 
        such as OSCE and encourages Belarus to advance towards a more open 
        government that increasingly responds to the will of its people: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
United States and the Republic of Belarus should allow the number of 
diplomatic staff in both the embassies in Minsk and Washington, DC, to 
increase to more appropriate levels for the necessary conduct of 
diplomatic relations, including the exchanging of ambassadors and full 
diplomatic relations.
