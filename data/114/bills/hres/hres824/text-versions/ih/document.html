 Expressing support for dancing as a form of valuable exercise and of 
   artistic expression, and for the designation of July 30, 2016, as 
                          National Dance Day.

Whereas Nigel Lythgoe, executive producer and celebrity judge for the dance-
        themed television show ``So You Think You Can Dance'', in association 
        with the Dizzy Feet Foundation, has encouraged the creation of National 
        Dance Day celebrations in nations around the world, beginning with the 
        first National Dance Day on the National Mall in 2010;
Whereas the Dizzy Feet foundation and the Kennedy Center, in conjunction with 
        the office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will celebrate 
        National Dance Day on July 30, 2016, in Washington, DC, at the Kennedy 
        Center;
Whereas National Dance Day has captured the imagination of people throughout the 
        Nation and around the world and has helped popularize dancing as an art 
        form, a form of exercise, and as a way of having fun;
Whereas National Dance Day encourages many forms of dance expression, 
        representing the Nation's rich artistic, regional, ethnic, and racial 
        diversity;
Whereas National Dance Day features the spectrum of dance, from classical to 
        popular to line and partner dances;
Whereas dancing helps improve heart health, burn calories, strengthen muscles, 
        and improve flexibility for people of all ages;
Whereas health officials have repeatedly documented an overweight and obesity 
        epidemic among United States citizens of all backgrounds and ages;
Whereas dancing, in all its variations, is a popular form of physical exercise;
Whereas this year at the Kennedy Center in the Nation's Capital, performances by 
        the Dance Place Step Team, Bowen McCauley Dance, Furia Flamenca, Native 
        Pride Dancers, and Evan Ruggiero will entertain and encourage dancing;
Whereas instructional videos are available on the Dizzy Feet Foundation YouTube 
        channel featuring dance routines for all skill levels in advance of 
        National Dance Day to be performed by audiences on National Dance Day; 
        and
Whereas the last Saturday in July continues to be the day to celebrate National 
        Dance Day annually as it has been for the past six years: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Dance Day to 
        celebrate and encourage a national commitment to dance and 
        dance education;
            (2) acknowledges that dance is making an important 
        contribution to health by encouraging physical fitness and 
        reducing overweight and obesity; and
            (3) commends Nigel Lythgoe for his leadership in promoting 
        National Dance Day.
