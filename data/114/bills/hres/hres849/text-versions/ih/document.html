                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing condolences to the people of Italy and support for the 
Government of Italy in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that 
             struck the Lazio and Marche regions of Italy.

Whereas in the early morning hours of August 24, 2016, a 6.2-magnitude 
        earthquake struck the Lazio and Marche regions in central Italy, killing 
        over 250 people, and displacing over 1,000 people;
Whereas the epicenter of the earthquake was the town of Norcia, located about 70 
        miles northeast of Rome, and massive destruction was reported in 
        Amatrice, Arquata, Accumoli, Pescara del Tronto, and other surrounding 
        villages;
Whereas hundreds of aftershocks continue to rock the region, making rescue and 
        recovery efforts even more challenging;
Whereas this marks the largest earthquake in Italy since 2009;
Whereas the earthquake flattened houses, buckled roads, and damaged centuries-
        old buildings, including a 15th century church of St. Augustine in 
        Amatrice;
Whereas Amatrice is well-known for its annual two-day Festival of the Spaghetti 
        all'Amatriciana to celebrate one of Italy's most famous pasta dishes;
Whereas humanitarian aid agencies in the United States and around the world are 
        mobilizing to provide much needed assistance to the relief and recovery 
        efforts; and
Whereas President Barack Obama has expressed his condolences, and those of the 
        people of the United States, to families that have lost loved ones, 
        praised the quick action of first responders and volunteers, and assured 
        Italian President Sergio Mattarella that the United States stands ready 
        to help Italy in this time of need: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) mourns the loss of life and expresses its deepest 
        condolences to the families of those killed and injured in the 
        earthquake in Italy on August 24, 2016;
            (2) recognizes the deep and binding ties between the United 
        States and Italy and expresses continued solidarity with the 
        people of Italy during this time of crisis;
            (3) applauds the courageous actions of the first responders 
        and volunteers;
            (4) supports President Obama's offer of the assistance of 
        the United States to Italy in response to this devastating 
        event;
            (5) urges the people of the United States to generously 
        support those humanitarian aid agencies working to assist the 
        people of Italy in this time of need;
            (6) commends the many United States organizations, 
        including the National Italian-American Foundation, working to 
        demonstrate support and solidarity with the Italian people and 
        raising funds to aid in the rebuilding and relief efforts; and
            (7) expresses gratitude to the people of the United States 
        who have generously supported those humanitarian aid agencies 
        working tirelessly to assist the people of Italy in this time 
        of need.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
