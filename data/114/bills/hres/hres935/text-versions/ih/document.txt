                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House that Congress should recognize the 
 benefits of charitable giving and express support for the designation 
                           of #GivingTuesday.

Whereas the Tuesday following Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday kicks 
        off the holiday giving season with a global day dedicated to charitable 
        giving known as #GivingTuesday;
Whereas #GivingTuesday is in its fourth year and has become a worldwide movement 
        that celebrates the power of giving in all its forms;
Whereas #GivingTuesday brought together more than 2,500 organizations in all 50 
        States in its first year and continues to gain momentum with more than 
        45,000 partners in the United States and around the world, increasing 
        online donations 755 percent since the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in 
        2011 (before #GivingTuesday began);
Whereas #GivingTuesday, along with other community giving days, highlights the 
        charitable community in America which boasts one-and-a-half million 
        nonprofits, philanthropic organizations, and religious congregations 
        dedicated to improving lives and strengthening communities;
Whereas nonprofit organizations are key partners with Federal, State, and local 
        governments in the delivery of key programs and services, including 
        child learning and nutrition, emergency disaster response, victims' 
        services, and job training and placement programs;
Whereas communities are lifted up by the exposure of all citizens to the 
        cultural, educational, and civic opportunities provided by nonprofit 
        organizations;
Whereas United States volunteerism and generosity toward the common good led to 
        over 60 percent of Americans, including 84 percent of millennials, 
        making financial contributions to support the work of nonprofit 
        organizations;
Whereas recent bipartisan polling found that 78 percent of voters support 
        increased collaboration between the government and the charitable 
        sector, 88 percent believe it should be easier for individuals to deduct 
        charitable contributions, and 79 percent believe all individuals should 
        be allowed to deduct charitable contributions, not just those who 
        itemize deductions;
Whereas virtually every person in the United States benefits from the work of 
        the charitable community, which employs over 13,700,000 workers, or 10 
        percent, of the United States workforce, and engages an additional 
        63,000,000 volunteers;
Whereas the charitable sector plays a vital economic role contributing 
        $887,300,000,000 to the United States economy, including providing 
        nearly $588,000,000 in annual wages and benefits;
Whereas individuals, foundations, and businesses give over $335,000,000,000 to 
        support charitable causes in 2014, and it has been estimated that, with 
        no deduction for charitable gifts, annual individual giving would drop 
        by 25 to 36 percent;
Whereas other effective charitable giving incentives in the tax code related to 
        individual retirement account contributions, food donations, and 
        conservation easement donations expired on January 1, 2015, for the 
        fifth time in recent years;
Whereas the United States is a great country with a strong philanthropic 
        tradition that should be continued and carried on; and
Whereas giving back is something all political parties can agree on, 
        transcending any differences of ideology and uniting people across 
        boundaries; Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes that the United States needs a strong and 
        vibrant charitable and philanthropic sector to enable 
        communities to meet local needs;
            (2) supports the designation of #GivingTuesday as a way to 
        encourage charitable giving and therefore enact positive change 
        and promote causes that further progress and prosperity for a 
        better world; and
            (3) supports strong incentives for all Americans to give 
        generously to charitable organizations by protecting the 
        existing charitable deduction and reinstating incentives that 
        encourage philanthropy, volunteering, and innovation.
