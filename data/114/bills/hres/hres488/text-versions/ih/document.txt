                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of National Retirement Security Week, 
    including raising public awareness of the various tax-preferred 
   retirement vehicles, increasing personal financial literacy, and 
  engaging the people of the United States on the keys to success in 
    achieving and maintaining retirement security throughout their 
                               lifetimes.

Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and the cost of 
        retirement is increasing significantly;
Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement income for the great 
        majority of the people of the United States but was never intended by 
        Congress to be the sole source of retirement income for families;
Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute indicates that, 
        in the United States--

    (1) only approximately \2/3\ of workers or the spouses of the workers 
are saving for retirement; and

    (2) the amount that workers have saved for retirement is much less than 
the amount the workers need to adequately fund their retirement years;

Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United States is important for 
        the workers to understand the need to save for retirement;
Whereas saving for retirement is a key component of overall financial health and 
        security during retirement years, and the importance of financial 
        literacy in planning for retirement must be advocated;
Whereas many workers may not--

    (1) be aware of the various options in saving for retirement; or

    (2) have focused on the importance of, and need for, saving for 
retirement and successfully achieving retirement security;

Whereas, although many employees have access through their employers to defined 
        benefit and defined contribution plans to assist the employees in 
        preparing for retirement, many of the employees may not be taking 
        advantage of those plans at all or to the full extent allowed by Federal 
        law;
Whereas saving for retirement is necessary even during economic downturns or 
        market declines, which makes continued contributions all the more 
        important;
Whereas all workers, including public and private sector employees, employees of 
        tax-exempt organizations, and self-employed individuals, can benefit 
        from developing personal budgets and financial plans that include 
        retirement savings strategies that take advantage of tax-preferred 
        retirement savings vehicles;
Whereas effectively and sustainably withdrawing retirement resources throughout 
        the retirement years of an individual is as important and crucial as 
        saving and accumulating funds for retirement; and
Whereas the week of October 18 through October 24, 2015, has been designated as 
        ``National Retirement Security Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Retirement 
        Security Week, including raising public awareness of the 
        importance of saving adequately for retirement;
            (2) acknowledges the need to raise public awareness of a 
        variety of tax-preferred retirement vehicles that are used by 
        many people in the United States but could be used by more; and
            (3) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, 
        nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the 
        people of the United States to observe National Retirement 
        Security Week with appropriate programs and activities, with 
        the goal of increasing the retirement savings and personal 
        financial literacy of all people in the United States, thereby 
        enhancing the retirement security of the people of the United 
        States.
                                 <all>
