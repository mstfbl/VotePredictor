                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the achievements of America's high school valedictorians of 
    the graduating class of 2016, encouraging civic engagement, and 
  commending academic excellence of all American high school students.

Whereas valedictorians are conferred as the highest academically ranked students 
        in their high school's graduating class;
Whereas our Nation's secondary schools honor their highest academically ranked 
        students with the ``valedictorian'' title;
Whereas valedictorians have demonstrated consistency in their intellectual 
        inquiry, academic discipline, determination, and utilization of teacher 
        mentoring throughout their high school careers;
Whereas valedictorians serve as peer role models to fellow high school students 
        by succeeding academically and contributing to community improvement;
Whereas valedictorians are charged with the duty of giving a graduation speech 
        that reflects upon the development, community involvement, and future of 
        the graduating class and inspires all graduating students to advance 
        their academic studies, further their career aspirations, continue their 
        growth, engage civically, and commit to improving society;
Whereas numerous valedictorians and graduating seniors will further their 
        intellectual interests, academic studies, career aspirations, and 
        efforts to help their communities by enrolling in universities, 
        postsecondary educational institutions, and vocational schools, 
        immediately enriching themselves, those around them, and society as a 
        whole;
Whereas family members, teachers, school administrators, and community members 
        have supported and nurtured graduating students, allowing for their 
        growth as individuals and members of society; and
Whereas valedictorians and graduating seniors will become America's future 
        civic, business, and political leaders, maintaining our Nation's global 
        leadership position and strengthening its economic competitiveness: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors and recognizes the valedictorians and graduating 
        seniors of the class of 2016 for their academic achievements 
        and contributions to their communities; and
            (2) encourages all valedictorians and graduating seniors to 
        utilize the life skills and knowledge they have gained to 
        benefit themselves, those around them, their communities, and 
        the social, cultural, and economic advancement of the United 
        States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
