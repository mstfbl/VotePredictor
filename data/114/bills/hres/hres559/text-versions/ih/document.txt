                               RESOLUTION


 
 Disapproving of Executive Order 13688 (regarding Federal support for 
local law enforcement equipment acquisition) issued by President Obama 
                          on January 16, 2015.

Whereas the terrorist attack in San Bernardino shows that our local authorities 
        are front and center in the fight against ISIS and other terror 
        networks;
Whereas local law enforcement officials have stated the President's plan to 
        remove these vehicles will ``leave communities at risk'';
Whereas if there is an act of terrorism or if there is an active shooter in a 
        mall or a school, local law enforcement are the first responders;
Whereas the President is making it more challenging for budget-strapped 
        authorities to respond to a potentially deadly attack in their 
        communities; and
Whereas tracked armored vehicles are used in rescue and response situations and 
        are employed in a responsible manner, only coming out when absolutely 
        necessary: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives does not favor 
Executive Order 13688 (regarding Federal support for local law 
enforcement equipment acquisition) issued by President Obama on January 
16, 2015.
                                 <all>
