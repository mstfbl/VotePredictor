                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week of October 30 through 
          November 5, 2016, as ``National Obesity Care Week''.

Whereas the disease of obesity is a major source of concern across the United 
        States, and more than one-third of adults in the United States are 
        affected by obesity, with the number of people with severe obesity in 
        the United States continuing to grow;
Whereas experts and researchers agree that obesity is a complex disease 
        influenced by various physiological, environmental, and genetic factors;
Whereas, while prevention programs have successfully established the seriousness 
        of the public health crisis posed by obesity, it is also imperative that 
        individuals and families currently affected by obesity receive 
        comprehensive care and treatment;
Whereas studies show that bias against and stigma associated with people 
        affected by obesity among general society and healthcare professionals 
        are significant barriers to effectively treating the disease;
Whereas healthcare professionals, policymakers, patients, and families should 
        regard obesity with the same level of seriousness with which other 
        chronic diseases are regarded;
Whereas research suggests that weight loss of as little as 5 to 10 percent of 
        the total weight of an individual affected by obesity can improve the 
        associated health risks affecting many patients living with obesity and 
        can thereby support the goals of Federal and State initiatives to reduce 
        chronic disease, improve health outcomes, and help control healthcare 
        costs;
Whereas healthcare professionals should treat patients with respect and 
        compassion and should partner with patients to develop comprehensive and 
        individualized approaches to weight loss and weight management that 
        consider all appropriate treatment options, such as reduced-calorie 
        diets, physical activity modifications, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric 
        surgery;
Whereas it will take a long-term collaborative effort, which will involve 
        individual, corporate, and institutional partners in all fields taking 
        active roles, to ignite the betterment of obesity care and treatment; 
        and
Whereas the week of October 30 through November 5, 2016, would be an appropriate 
        week to designate as ``National Obesity Care Week'': Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Obesity Care 
        Week''; and
            (2) encourages all people in the United States to create a 
        foundation of open communication to break barriers of 
        misunderstanding and stigma regarding obesity and to improve 
        the lives of all individuals affected by obesity and their 
        families.
                                 <all>
