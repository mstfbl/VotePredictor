H. Res. 163

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 24, 2015.
    Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker 
may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the 
concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 27) establishing the budget for the United 
States Government for fiscal year 2016 and setting forth appropriate budgetary 
levels for fiscal years 2017 through 2025. The first reading of the concurrent 
resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of 
the concurrent resolution are waived. General debate shall not exceed four 
hours, with three hours of general debate confined to the congressional budget 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on the Budget and one hour of general debate on the subject of 
economic goals and policies equally divided and controlled by Representative 
Brady of Texas and Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York or their 
respective designees. After general debate the concurrent resolution shall be 
considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. The concurrent resolution 
shall be considered as read. No amendment shall be in order except those printed 
in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such 
amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered 
only by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, and 
shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and 
controlled by the proponent and an opponent. All points of order against such 
amendments are waived. If more than one such amendment is adopted, then only the 
one receiving the greater number of affirmative votes shall be considered as 
finally adopted. In the case of a tie for the greater number of affirmative 
votes, then only the last amendment to receive that number of affirmative votes 
shall be considered as finally adopted. After the conclusion of consideration of 
the concurrent resolution for amendment and a final period of general debate, 
which shall not exceed 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget, the Committee shall 
rise and report the concurrent resolution to the House with such amendment as 
may have been finally adopted. The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the concurrent resolution and amendments thereto to adoption without 
intervening motion except amendments offered by the chair of the Committee on 
the Budget pursuant to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
to achieve mathematical consistency. The concurrent resolution shall not be 
subject to a demand for division of the question of its adoption.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
