                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to 
            third-party charges on consumer telephone bills.

Whereas telephone companies are required to permit third parties to bill for 
        services on a consumer's monthly telephone bill in certain 
        circumstances;
Whereas ``cramming'' is the act of placing unauthorized charges on a wireline, 
        wireless, or bundled services telephone bill of a consumer;
Whereas the Federal Communications Commission estimates that cramming has harmed 
        tens of millions of people in the United States; and
Whereas existing protections against cramming have not prevented harm to 
        consumers: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
protections against cramming should be improved and consumers should be 
empowered to stop unwanted third-party charges on their telephone 
bills.
