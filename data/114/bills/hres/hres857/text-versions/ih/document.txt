                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the week of September 12 through 
         16, 2016 as ``National Family Service Learning Week''.

Whereas the term ``family service learning'' means a method under which children 
        and families learn and solve problems together in a multi-generational 
        approach with active participation in thoughtfully organized service 
        that--

    (1) is conducted in and meets the needs of their community;

    (2) is focused on children and families solving community issues 
together;

    (3) applies college and career readiness skills for children and 
relevant workforce training skills for adults; and

    (4) is coordinated with an elementary school, secondary school, 
institution of higher education, or family/community organization, and the 
community;

Whereas family service learning is--

    (1) multi-generational learning that involves parents, children, 
caregivers, and extended family members in shared learning experiences in 
both physical and digital environments;

    (2) integrated into and enhances the academic achievement of the 
children or the educational components of a family service program in which 
the families may be enrolled; and

    (3) encompasses skills such as investigation, planning and preparation, 
action, reflection, demonstration of results, and sustainability;

Whereas family service learning has been shown to have positive two-generational 
        effects and invests families in their communities to improve both 
        economic and societal well-being;
Whereas through service learning, children and families are offered the 
        opportunity to solve community issues and learn together, thereby 
        enabling the development of life and career skills, such as flexibility 
        and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-
        cultural skills, productivity and accountability, leadership and 
        responsibility;
Whereas family service learning activities provide opportunities for families to 
        improve essential skills such as organization, research, planning, 
        reading and writing, technology, teamwork, and sharing;
Whereas families participating together in service are afforded quality time 
        learning about their communities;
Whereas adults engaged in family service learning serve as positive role models 
        for their children;
Whereas service learning projects enable low-income families to build 
        substantive connections with their community, develop a stronger sense 
        of self-worth, experience a reduction in social isolation, and improve 
        parenting skills;
Whereas service learning has added benefits for non-native English speakers as 
        participation helps them to feel less like outsiders and more accepted 
        in the United States;
Whereas family service learning is particularly important for families at risk 
        because it provides the opportunity for marginalized populations to 
        develop future leadership opportunities, civic engagement, and the 
        capacity to more effectively advocate for children and families' needs; 
        and
Whereas the value that parents place on civic engagement and relationships 
        within the community has been shown to transfer to the child who, in 
        turn, replicates values such as responsibility, empathy, and caring for 
        others: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Family Service 
        Learning Week'' to raise public awareness about the importance 
        of family service learning, family literacy, community service, 
        and two-generational learning experiences;
            (2) encourages people across the United States to support 
        family service learning and community development programs;
            (3) recognizes the importance that family service learning 
        plays in cultivating family literacy, civic engagement, and 
        community investment; and
            (4) calls upon public, private, and nonprofit entities to 
        support family service learning opportunities to aid in the 
        advancement of families.
                                 <all>
