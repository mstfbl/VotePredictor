                               RESOLUTION


 
     Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords.

Whereas, on December 14, 1995, the general framework agreement for Peace in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina, known as the Dayton Peace Accords, ended a 
        conflict that threatened to destabilize Europe and resulted in the death 
        of approximately 250,000 people, and the displacement of more than 
        2,000,000 men, women, and children;
Whereas negotiations began on November 1, 1995, at Wright-Patterson Air Force 
        Base in Dayton, Ohio, and after 21 days of negotiations, the leaders of 
        Bosnia, Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia acquiesced to a peace 
        settlement that would halt conflicts that had brought destruction and 
        ruin to Bosnia and Herzegovina since April 1992;
Whereas previous attempts to negotiate peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina had been 
        unsuccessful and coercion for lasting peace by world powers, 
        particularly the United States and Russia, finally forced the three 
        sides into negotiations in Dayton, Ohio;
Whereas the United States negotiating team lead by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke 
        guided peace negotiations endorsed by members of the European Union (EU) 
        and Russian Federation;
Whereas 21 days of intense negotiations occurring at the Hope Hotel at Wright-
        Patterson Air Force Base brought hope and an opportunity for peace;
Whereas the negotiations succeeded, against all predictions, due to outstanding 
        leadership, determination of all involved, mutual desire for a peaceful 
        resolution, and the extensive community support;
Whereas Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was chosen as the site of negotiations 
        due to its diversity and security, which offered an environment where 
        the warring parties could focus on negotiating peace out of the 
        spotlight of the media and away from distracting geopolitical pressures;
Whereas the Dayton community unexpectedly became part of the process as its 
        people became proud to be part of history, holding candlelight vigils, 
        placing ``candles of peace'' in their front windows, congratulating and 
        praying for the negotiators, forming a human peace chain around Wright-
        Patterson Air Force Base, and continuing to study peace and human rights 
        based on the community's experiences hosting these historic 
        negotiations;
Whereas negotiators highlighted Ohio's ethnic diversity to show the warring 
        parties that people from disparate ethnic histories could live everyday 
        life in peace;
Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords provided a framework and common agreement to 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) implementation and 
        stabilization force missions which provided security for the citizens of 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia;
Whereas the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, established in 2006, remains the only 
        literary peace prize awarded in the United States, and continues the 
        legacy of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords by honoring authors who write 
        about peace and whose work provides enduring literary value;
Whereas the Dayton International Peace Museum in downtown Dayton, a nonprofit, 
        all-volunteer organization, is one of the few community-based 
        institutions with a focus on peace in the United States, and the Museum 
        honors Dayton's history as the host of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords, 
        offering nonpartisan educational programs and exhibits featuring themes 
        of nonviolent conflict resolution, social justice issues, international 
        relations, and peace;
Whereas the Dayton, Ohio, community supported the peace negotiations and worked 
        to create a strong, lasting relationship with Bosnia and Herzegovina by 
        hosting numerous visiting delegations, creating a sister city 
        relationship with Sarajevo, and hosting an international anniversary 
        commemoration;
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina received a conditional Membership Action Plan to 
        join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) pending continued 
        progress on reforms, and deployed troops with the International Security 
        Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2009 through the end of the mission last 
        year, and continue to support NATO and its allies through the deployment 
        of troops for the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission;
Whereas Croatia successfully became a NATO member in 2009 and a European Union 
        (EU) member in 2013, and formerly deployed troops with the ISAF, and is 
        currently supporting the Resolute Support mission;
Whereas the Montenegrin Parliament declared independence from Serbia on June 3, 
        2006, and thus created a multi-ethnic country with a viable economy, 
        professional military, and democratic institutions, and has a Membership 
        Action Plan to join NATO, and has deployed troops currently 
        participating in the Resolute Support mission;
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Montenegro continue to fight 
        alongside NATO and the United States Armed Forces to bring peace, 
        stability, and prosperity to others;
Whereas Serbia reached an agreement on normalizing relations with Kosovo in 
        2013, and was accepted as a European Union (EU) membership candidate in 
        2014, and continues to implement changes on the path to full EU 
        membership, and Serbia's strong efforts to arrest the last 2 indicted 
        war criminals sought by the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
        Former Yugoslavia was successful;
Whereas the entire State of Ohio has contributed to stability and prosperity in 
        the Balkan region by fostering an exemplary relationship between the 
        Ohio National Guard and the Serbian Armed Forces; and
Whereas the Dayton Peace Accords effectively ended the conflict, created a 
        multi-ethnic country in the Balkans, and addressed topics critical to 
        the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including regional stabilization, 
        a constitutional framework, the repatriation of refugees, and internal 
        security: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the significant 
        progress it has made over the past 20 years on the 
        implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords;
            (2) welcomes and encourages the aspiration of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO);
            (3) reaffirms the importance of the successful 
        participation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the European 
        integration process for the future freedom and prosperity of 
        its citizens;
            (4) encourages the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
        continue reforms on economic and constitutional issues;
            (5) encourages the international community to gather for a 
        Dayton Peace Accords II in order to reaffirm our commitment to 
        lasting peace in the Balkans; and
            (6) recognizes the role of the State of Ohio as well as the 
        Greater Dayton community in fostering and promoting the Dayton 
        Peace Accords and its ideals, and continuing to support 
        diplomacy, security, and peace around the world.
                                 <all>
