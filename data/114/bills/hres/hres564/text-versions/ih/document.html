                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the symbols 
 and traditions of Christmas should be protected for use by those who 
                          celebrate Christmas.

Whereas Christmas is a national holiday celebrated on December 25; and
Whereas the Framers intended that the First Amendment of the Constitution, in 
        prohibiting the establishment of religion, would not prohibit any 
        mention of religion or reference to God in civic dialog: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
    (1) recognizes the importance of the symbols and traditions of 
Christmas;
    (2) strongly disapproves of attempts to ban references to 
Christmas; and
    (3) expresses support for the use of these symbols and traditions 
by those who celebrate Christmas.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
