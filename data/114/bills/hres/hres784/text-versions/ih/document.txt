                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing support for the designation of Journeymen Linemen 
                            Recognition Day.

Whereas journeymen linemen provide a vital service on a daily basis;
Whereas journeymen linemen put their lives on the line every day to assure safe 
        and reliable power for the American people;
Whereas journeymen linemen work at heights and in close proximity to energized 
        electric lines, and in emergencies they often work extremely long hours 
        under sometimes dangerous conditions to restore power;
Whereas Henry Miller, the first elected president of the International 
        Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was killed on July 10, 1896, at just 
        38 years old;
Whereas Henry Miller died of injuries sustained while troubleshooting an 
        electrical outage; and
Whereas there should be a day to honor those industry first responders who have 
        given their lives in the line of duty along with those who provide 
        skillful service in times of local or national crisis: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Journeymen Linemen 
        Recognition Day;
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of the 
        countless individuals who often place themselves in harm's way 
        to serve their communities; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Journeymen Linemen Recognition Day with appropriate reflection.
                                 <all>
