                               RESOLUTION


 
     Recognizing the important role pollinators play in supporting 
                       ecosystems and economies.

Whereas bees, birds, butterflies, and other pollinators are vital to sustaining 
        a healthy ecosystem;
Whereas pollinators are responsible for an estimated one out of every three 
        bites of food that we eat and nearly $20,000,000,000 annually to the 
        economy;
Whereas diversity of pollinators is necessary for diversity of plant life and 
        the stability of our food supply;
Whereas several serious stressing factors have led to an alarming decline of 
        pollinators worldwide, especially vital commercial honey bees;
Whereas since 2006, over 10,000,000 hives with a value of roughly $2,000,000,000 
        have been lost; and
Whereas a continued decline in pollinators would put our food security, economy, 
        and healthy ecosystems at risk: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of pollinators in agriculture 
        and in maintaining our diverse ecosystem; and
            (2) supports ongoing efforts to advance research and 
        increase public awareness.
                                 <all>
