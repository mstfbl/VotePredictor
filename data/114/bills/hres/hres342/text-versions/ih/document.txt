                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
                    enhancement of unity in America.

Whereas, on June 18, 2015, the United States Supreme Court correctly concluded 
        in Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. (No. 
        14-144) that messages on State license plates constitute ``government 
        speech'', not private speech protected by the First Amendment;
Whereas the Court also held that it is within the authority of a State such as 
        Texas to reject messages on State-issued license plates, such as a 
        depiction of the Confederate battle flag, that offend the sensibilities 
        of its citizens;
Whereas divisive symbols, license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, 
        and flags on public buildings or government property, which constitute 
        ``government speech'', convey the vestiges of the history of slavery 
        that has divided the United States;
Whereas the role of government is to promote equal protection under the 
        Constitution and combat fear, oppression, and intimidation;
Whereas these divisive symbols have historically targeted and perpetuated fear, 
        oppression, and intimidation of certain groups of Americans;
Whereas the continued existence of these divisive symbols as ``government 
        speech'' is also a denial of equal protection under the law;
Whereas the United States can only be a perfect union where all are and feel 
        equally protected under the law; and
Whereas equal protection under the law promotes a more perfect union, fairness, 
        tolerance, peace, and a sense of community oneness, all unalienable 
        rights enshrined in the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States can achieve a more perfect union--
            (1) through avoidance of ``government speech'', as the 
        State of Texas did in Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of 
        Confederate Veterans, Inc., which promotes or displays symbols, 
        signs, and vestiges of racism, oppression, and intimidation in 
        the States, localities, and territories;
            (2) by immediately abating the use of ``government speech'' 
        through signs, actions, and words that promote division and 
        tear at the fabric of the American society; and
            (3) by promoting tolerance and unity by taking actions to 
        ensure that ``government speech'' does not foster division, 
        disharmony, intolerance through government-issued or sponsored 
        flags, signs, images, or other symbols whether displayed in 
        public or private.
                                 <all>
