  Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require each 
 report of a committee on a public bill or public joint resolution to 
 include an analysis of whether the bill or joint resolution creates a 
program, office, or initiative that would duplicate or overlap with an 
    existing program, office, or initiative, and for other purposes.

Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
    ``(i)(1) Each report of a committee on a public bill or public 
joint resolution shall contain the following:
            ``(A) An analysis by the Congressional Research Service 
        (CRS) to determine if the bill or joint resolution creates any 
        new Federal program, office, or initiative that would duplicate 
        or overlap with any existing Federal entity with similar 
        mission, purpose, goals, or activities, along with a listing of 
        all such instances of duplication or overlapping created by the 
        bill or joint resolution.
            ``(B) If the analysis provided under subdivision (A) 
        indicates that the new program, office, or initiative would 
        create duplication or overlapping, an explanation provided by 
        the committee as to why the creation of the new program, 
        office, or initiative is necessary.
    ``(2) It shall not be in order to consider a public bill or public 
joint resolution reported by a committee unless the committee has 
posted on its public website the analysis provided under subparagraph 
(1)(A) and (if necessary) the explanation provided under subparagraph 
(1)(B).''.
