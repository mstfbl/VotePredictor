                               RESOLUTION


 
    Calling for revisions to the existing rules of engagement under 
               Operation Resolute Support in Afghanistan.

Whereas, according to some press accounts, Taliban forces now maintain a 
        significant presence controlling 28 percent of districts across 
        Afghanistan, more than at any point since 2001;
Whereas Taliban personnel are determined to take control of Helmand and secure 
        its stake in heroin trade, an important source of income for the 
        fundamentalist Islamic movement;
Whereas continued talks between Afghan Government officials and Taliban leaders 
        have ceased, with the death of Mullah Akhtar Mansour, Taliban moderates 
        refuse to compromise for any peace;
Whereas Taliban forces continue to harbor and assist known terrorist groups such 
        as the Haqqani Network with weapons and territorial passage and are 
        directly responsible for the deaths of United States and allied troops;
Whereas the former United States commander in Afghanistan, General John 
        Campbell, argued before he retired that the Taliban must be forced into 
        a decision between fighting and talking, stating ``they have to have 
        more pressure put on them and one way to do that is to potentially 
        strike them.'';
Whereas in May 2016, General David Petraeus stated in the Wall Street Journal, 
        ``[T]he rules of engagement mean that the indigenous Afghan and 
        Pakistani Taliban generally get a pass. Yet it was the Taliban that 
        allowed al Qaeda the sanctuary in Afghanistan in which the 9/11 attacks 
        were planned, and which presumably would make the Taliban a legitimate 
        target under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force.'';
Whereas General Campbell testified before Congress, stating ``If the Taliban are 
        attacking coalition forces, then I have everything I need to do that, to 
        attack the Taliban just because they're Taliban, I do not have that 
        authority.'';
Whereas the 2001 authorization of the use of military force (Public Law 107-40) 
        consistently has been cited by the Bush and Obama Administrations as 
        providing legal authority for the use of force against the Afghan 
        Taliban; and
Whereas United States operations against the Taliban have been undermined with 
        strict rules of engagement which are confusing, contradictory, 
        inconsistent, and politically driven: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) urges the President to revise the existing rules of 
        engagement in Afghanistan and provide commanders the ability to 
        target Taliban outside of instances where they pose a direct 
        threat to the United States or its allies;
            (2) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist activity 
        in the Afghanistan region, especially the actions Taliban 
        forces have assisted and participated in against Afghan forces, 
        United States Armed Forces and NATO Forces;
            (3) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign 
        fighters to and from Afghanistan; and
            (4) urges the President to empower the commander of 
        Operation Resolute Support with the authority to train, advise, 
        and assist the Afghan National Defense Security Forces at the 
        tactical level as missions require.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
