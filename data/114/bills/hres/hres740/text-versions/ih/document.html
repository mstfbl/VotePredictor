Congratulating Dr. and Mrs. David and Valerie Hodge on a successful 10-
             year tenure as President of Miami University.

Whereas through President Hodge's leadership Miami University advanced its 
        reputation for an exceptionally strong commitment to undergraduate 
        teaching, being ranked by U.S. News and World Report as the No. 1 or No. 
        2 public university in this category over the past 6 years;
Whereas Miami University has welcomed evermore accomplished incoming students 
        from a wider and more diverse pool of prospective students while greatly 
        expanding the role of career services to better prepare and create more 
        opportunities for its graduates;
Whereas under the guidance of the President, Miami has launched major curricular 
        changes that emphasize experiential, active learning with an emphasis on 
        undergraduate research and study abroad;
Whereas President Hodge embraced a new role for Miami Regionals in providing 
        baccalaureate degrees appropriate for students and the region;
Whereas President Hodge led the creation of the Miami Access Initiative, in 
        order to make Miami an affordable offer for all Ohioans;
Whereas President Hodge opened the first centralized geothermal facility 
        improving campus sustainability and reducing Miami's carbon footprint;
Whereas President Hodge opened the new Farmer School of Business, the 
        Engineering complex, and the Voice of America Learning Center while 
        completely remodeling Presser, Kreger and Shideler Halls to provide 
        first-class facilities to accommodate active student learning;
Whereas President Hodge is responsible for enriching student life dramatically 
        with the dedication of the Armstrong Student Center and the renovation 
        and construction of a number of residence halls; and
Whereas President Hodge emphasized creative innovation to significantly improve 
        operations and reduce costs, including a campus-wide 25-percent 
        reduction in energy use per square foot, leading to Miami being named 
        the most efficient university in the Nation for producing high quality 
        results: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates Dr. and Mrs. David and Valerie Hodge for 
        their successful tenure leading Miami University over the last 
        decade; and
            (2) recognizes that Dr. and Mrs. David and Valerie Hodge 
        leave behind a significant legacy of success that have 
        benefitted the lives of countless students, and positioned 
        Miami as a premier Ohio institution of higher education.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
