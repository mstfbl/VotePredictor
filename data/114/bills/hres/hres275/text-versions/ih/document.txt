                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Asian and Pacific Islander 
                        HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.

Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders are the fastest 
        growing racial or ethnic groups in the United States and constitute 
        diverse communities including more than 50 different ethnic sub-groups 
        speaking more than 100 languages and dialects;
Whereas the rates of HIV diagnoses for Asian Americans increased to 6.0 per 
        100,000 from 2009 through 2013, reflecting that Asian Americans were one 
        of only two racial/ethnic groups in which rates increased;
Whereas Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders had the 4th highest estimated 
        rates of HIV diagnoses (12.7 per 100,000 people) in the United States by 
        race and ethnicity, from 2009 through 2013;
Whereas recent CDC estimates indicate that among people living with HIV/AIDS, 22 
        percent of Asian Americans, and 27 percent of Native Hawaiians and 
        Pacific Islanders, are unaware they are infected with HIV;
Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have the highest 
        percent of adults who have never been tested for HIV, as 7 in 10 have 
        never been tested for HIV in 2012;
Whereas 36 percent of HIV diagnoses among Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Pacific Islanders progressed to AIDS in less than 12 months in 2010;
Whereas the CDC estimates that through 2013, 15,525 Asian Americans and 1,311 
        Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have been diagnosed with HIV/
        AIDS;
Whereas significant barriers remain for accessing culturally and linguistically 
        competent services, especially HIV testing;
Whereas HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination continues to be a growing problem in 
        all communities, including the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and 
        Pacific Islander community;
Whereas HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination increases risk-taking behavior and 
        prevents people from accessing the HIV/AIDS services and support they 
        need;
Whereas the National HIV/AIDS Strategy released in July 2010 established the 
        three primary goals of reducing HIV incidence, increasing access to 
        care, and optimizing health outcomes and reducing HIV-related health 
        disparities, including specific strategies focused on Asian American, 
        Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations, such as targeted and 
        disaggregated surveillance and stigma prevention efforts and 
        interventions targeted to the men who have sex with men community;
Whereas the development of the Minority AIDS Initiative in 1998 to coordinate 
        funding, capacity building, and prevention, care, and treatment services 
        within African-American, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and 
        Native American communities has assisted with the development of 
        leadership in minority community-based organizations, provided 
        culturally and linguistically competent HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and 
        treatment services, developed community capacity and infrastructure, 
        promoted technical assistance and resources, and raised awareness among 
        Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities; and
Whereas, on May 19, 2015, community members from all ethnic groups will come 
        together in recognition of the eleventh annual National Asian and 
        Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the observance of National Asian and Pacific 
        Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to honor the memory of the 
        estimated 3,477 Asian Americans and 361 Native Hawaiians and 
        Pacific Islanders with HIV/AIDS in the United States who have 
        died, through 2012, as well as the estimated 11,075 Asian 
        Americans and 883 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who 
        are still living with HIV, through 2012;
            (2) recognizes the importance of culturally and 
        linguistically competent services as a core element in reducing 
        HIV/AIDS rates in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities;
            (3) recognizes the importance of addressing the gaps in 
        research and data in order to fully understand the HIV/AIDS 
        epidemic in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities; and
            (4) recognizes the people across the United States infected 
        and affected by HIV/AIDS who are commemorating this day with 
        community-wide activities and who work to reduce the impact of 
        HIV/AIDS on Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities across the United States and the United 
        States affiliated Pacific Island jurisdictions.
