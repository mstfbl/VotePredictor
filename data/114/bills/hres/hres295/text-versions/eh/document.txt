H. Res. 295

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         June 10, 2015.
Whereas the United States Department of Justice issued a report titled, ``Police 
        Officer Body-Worn Cameras'', which details a number of benefits of body-
        worn cameras, including--

    (1) increased transparency and citizen views of police legitimacy;

    (2) improved behavior and civility among both police officers and 
citizens; and

    (3) increased evidentiary benefits that expedite resolution of citizen 
complaints or lawsuits and improving evidence for arrest and prosecution; 
and

Whereas the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology conducted a 12-
        month study on the use of body-worn cameras used by law enforcement in 
        the United Kingdom and estimated that the cameras led to a 50 percent 
        reduction in use of force, and in addition, complaints against police 
        fell approximately by 90 percent: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes all law enforcement agencies and officers for their 
        tireless work to protect us and make our communities safer;
            (2) recognizes the potential for the use of body-worn cameras by on-
        duty law enforcement officers to improve community relations, increase 
        transparency, and protect both citizens and police; and
            (3) encourages State and local law enforcement agencies to consider 
        the use of body-worn cameras, including policies and protocols to handle 
        privacy, storage, and other relevant concerns.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
