                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting local law enforcement agencies in their continued work to 
serve our communities, and supporting their use of body worn cameras to 
   promote transparency to protect both citizens and officers alike.

Whereas the United States Department of Justice issued a report titled, ``Police 
        Officer Body-Worn Cameras'', which details a number of benefits of body-
        worn cameras, including--

    (1) increased transparency and citizen views of police legitimacy;

    (2) improved behavior and civility among both police officers and 
citizens; and

    (3) increased evidentiary benefits that expedite resolution of citizen 
complaints or lawsuits and improving evidence for arrest and prosecution; 
and

Whereas the University of Cambridge's Institute of Criminology conducted a 12-
        month study on the use of body-worn cameras used by law enforcement in 
        the United Kingdom and estimated that the cameras led to a 50 percent 
        reduction in use of force, and in addition, complaints against police 
        fell approximately by 90 percent: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes all law enforcement agencies and officers 
        for their tireless work to protect us and make our communities 
        safer;
            (2) recognizes the potential for the use of body-worn 
        cameras by on-duty law enforcement officers to improve 
        community relations, increase transparency, and protect both 
        citizens and police; and
            (3) encourages State and local law enforcement agencies to 
        consider the use of body-worn cameras, including policies and 
        protocols to handle privacy, storage, and other relevant 
        concerns.
                                 <all>
