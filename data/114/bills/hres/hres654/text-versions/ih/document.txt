                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing and supporting the goals of ``World Sleep Day'', on March 
                               18, 2016.

Whereas it is estimated that one-third of all adults suffer from clinically 
        recognized insomnia, and 80 other sleep disorders;
Whereas it is estimated up to 45 percent of the world's population suffers from 
        some type of sleep alteration;
Whereas an estimated 50,000,000 to 70,000,000 people in the United States 
        chronically suffer from a disorder of sleep and wakefulness, hindering 
        daily functioning and adversely affecting health and longevity;
Whereas the cumulative long-term effects of sleep loss and sleep disorders have 
        been associated with a wide range of deleterious health consequences 
        including an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity, 
        depression, heart attack, and stroke;
Whereas ``World Sleep Day'' is an annual event organized by the World Sleep Day 
        Committee of the World Sleep Society;
Whereas ``World Sleep Day'' celebrates the benefits of good and healthy sleep 
        and to draw society's attention to the burden of sleep problems and 
        their clinical, education, research and social aspects, to promote sleep 
        disorders' prevention and management; and
Whereas in 2016, the theme for ``World Sleep Day'' is ``Good Sleep is a 
        Reachable Dream'' and is intended to celebrate a large diversity of 
        activities surrounding the message that sleep maladies can be 
        ameliorated, but recognition must come first: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``World Sleep Day'' to 
        raise awareness of sleep disorders and their better 
        understanding and preventability, and to reduce the burden of 
        sleep problems on society that constitute a global epidemic and 
        threaten health and quality of life for as much as 45 percent 
        of the world's population;
            (2) applauds the goals and approaches of the World Sleep 
        Society to advance sleep health worldwide by promoting and 
        encouraging education, research, and patient care throughout 
        the World, particularly in those parts of the world where the 
        practice of sleep medicine is less developed; and
            (3) encourages members of the international community to 
        promote the advancement of sleep health worldwide.
