                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the third Sunday in October 
                   as Clergy Spouse Appreciation Day.

Whereas the church is where the community of saints assemble together to 
        cultivate, nurture, and enhance a concrete spiritual connection between 
        God and man that ultimately leads to advancing the minds and improving 
        the lives of those in the community;
Whereas the clergy are God's authorized representatives, whose mission is to 
        create an atmosphere of unity, love, and hope in an otherwise oppressed 
        and chaotic community;
Whereas the clergy extend themselves to organize, promote, and influence 
        programs and activities that create that atmosphere of unity, love, and 
        hope;
Whereas the clergy spouse has accepted the challenge to work alongside God's 
        ambassador as the spouse carries out the assigned mission of educating 
        and equipping the community with the necessary tools to enhance their 
        living standards;
Whereas the nature of the service provided by the clergy and their spouses is 
        unique, as they are entrusted with the spiritual well-being of the 
        flock, thereby creating a positive impact on their respective 
        communities;
Whereas the dedication and sacrifice provided by the clergy spouses to improve 
        the quality of life for their community is immeasurable;
Whereas a day in recognition of the contributions of the clergy spouses would 
        highlight their dedication by increasing awareness of the many service 
        programs organized and executed by the more than 200,000 clergy spouses 
        in the United States; and
Whereas the third Sunday in October would be an appropriate date to designate as 
        Clergy Spouse Appreciation Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of Clergy Spouse Appreciation Day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
