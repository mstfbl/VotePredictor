                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
firefight that occurred on March 4, 2007, between members of the United 
 States Marine Corps and enemy forces in Bati Kot District, Nangarhar 
                         Province, Afghanistan.

Whereas, during the morning of March 4, 2007, 30 Marines of Fox Company, Marine 
        Special Operations Command, on patrol in Bati Kot District, Nangarhar 
        Province, Afghanistan, were attacked in a complex ambush by enemy 
        forces;
Whereas the Marines of Fox Company responded to the attack with proportionate 
        defensive fire in accordance with the existing Rules of Engagement;
Whereas, in their response to the ambush, the Marines of Fox Company did not 
        engage in the intentional or indiscriminate killing of any civilians;
Whereas, as commander of Theater Special Operations forces, Lieutenant General 
        Frank Kearney prematurely decided to expel the entire Marine Special 
        Operations Company from Afghanistan notwithstanding their appropriate 
        response to an attack by the enemy;
Whereas General Kearney skewed public perception regarding the incident with his 
        statements, which led to an Inspector General investigation into his 
        actions;
Whereas, not only was the response by General Kearney unprecedented, but none of 
        the investigations that have been completed would warrant such action, 
        and General Kearney's decision damaged the development of the Marine 
        Special Operations Command and the personal livelihood of these Marines; 
        and
Whereas the Marines conduct during the complex ambush was exemplary and 
        reflected the high standards to which they were trained: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps should issue a public 
document certifying that members of Fox Company of the Marine Special 
Operations Command were not at fault in the firefight that occurred on 
March 4, 2007, between members of Fox Company and enemy forces in Bati 
Kot District, Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, and the Marines of Fox 
Company involved in this incident deserve to have their names cleared.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
