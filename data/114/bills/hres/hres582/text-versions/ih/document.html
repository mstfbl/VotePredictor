                               RESOLUTION


 
            Condemning and censuring President Barack Obama.

Whereas upon entering the Execution of the Office of President of the United 
        States, President Barack Obama affirmed his constitutional oath as 
        follows: ``I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office 
        of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, 
        preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States'';
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to faithfully execute the Office of 
        the President of the United States and has failed to preserve, protect 
        and defend the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to fulfill his duty in article II, 
        section 3 of the Constitution of the United States that he ``shall take 
        Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'';
Whereas the Constitution of the United States in article I, section 1 provides 
        that ``All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a 
        Congress of the United States'';
Whereas the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides 
        that ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
        infringed''; and
Whereas, on January 5, 2016, President Barack Obama defied article I, section 1 
        of the Constitution of the United States by implementing 
        unconstitutional executive actions without congressional consideration, 
        debate, or approval in order to infringe on the Second Amendment right 
        of the American people to keep and bear arms: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives does hereby censure and 
condemn Barack Obama for having willfully disregarded the legislative 
powers of the duly elected Congress provided by the Constitution of the 
United States through his executive actions to deprive American 
citizens of their constitutionally mandated right to bear arms under 
the Second Amendment.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
