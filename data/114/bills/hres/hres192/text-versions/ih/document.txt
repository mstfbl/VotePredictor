                               RESOLUTION


 
    Honoring the Sikh American community's celebration of Vaisakhi.

Whereas Sikhism is a religion founded in the Punjab region of South Asia over 5 
        centuries ago and introduced to the United States in the 19th century;
Whereas Sikhism is the fifth largest world religion with approximately 
        25,000,000 adherents from diverse backgrounds throughout the world, 
        including 500,000 adherents in the United States;
Whereas Sikhs in the United States pursue diverse professions and walks of life, 
        making rich contributions to the economic vibrancy of the United States 
        as farmers, engineers, doctors, scientists, and business owners;
Whereas Sikh Americans continue to make strides toward securing religious 
        liberty as patriotic members of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas Vaisakhi is one of the most religiously significant days in Sikh 
        history, commemorating the creation of the Khalsa, a fellowship of 
        devout Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699;
Whereas the Sikh religion is based on a belief in one God and the equality of 
        all human beings; and
Whereas the celebration of Vaisakhi includes performing Seva (selfless service), 
        such as providing free meals to all visitors to Sikh Gurdwaras (Houses 
        of Worship): Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives wishes the Sikh 
American community a joyous Vaisakhi.
                                 <all>
