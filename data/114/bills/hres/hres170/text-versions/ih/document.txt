                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the National Association of Letter Carriers' One Day Food 
                                 Drive.

Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) began their One Day 
        Food Drive in 1992;
Whereas for many years prior to 1992, a number of NALC branches collected food 
        for the needy in the communities they served;
Whereas in 1992, 10 cities were selected to explore a coordinated effort, and a 
        pilot food drive was held in Columbus, Ohio, by Branch 78 of the NALC;
Whereas the pilot food drive was so successful that the food drive was then 
        expanded nationwide;
Whereas a nationwide One Day Food Drive was organized for May 15, 1993, with the 
        goal of having at least one NALC Branch participate in each of the 50 
        States;
Whereas more than 220 NALC branches participated in the first national One Day 
        Food Drive and set a one-day record for food collection in the United 
        States by collecting more than 11 million pounds of food;
Whereas in 2014, the NALC collected nearly 73 million pounds of food to help 
        restock food banks, pantries, and shelters throughout the United States;
Whereas 2014 marked the 11th consecutive year that the One Day Food Drive 
        collected more than 70 million pounds of food;
Whereas the NALC One Day Food Drive has collected more than 1.3 billion pounds 
        of food since it began in 1992; and
Whereas the NALC One Day Food Drive occurs on the second Saturday in May each 
        year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the National Association of Letter Carriers' 
        One Day Food Drive; and
            (2) honors the National Association of Letter Carriers for 
        their distinguished community service and philanthropic 
        efforts.
                                 <all>
