                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the fourth week in May as ``DIPG 
  Awareness Week'' to raise awareness and encourage the research into 
cures for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and pediatric cancers 
                              in general.

Whereas diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) affects 200 to 400 children in 
        the United States each year;
Whereas brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children;
Whereas DIPG is the second most common malignant brain tumor of childhood;
Whereas DIPG is the leading cause of childhood death due to brain tumors;
Whereas the median survival is only 9 months;
Whereas 5-year survival is less than 1 percent;
Whereas given the age at diagnosis and the average life expectancy, the number 
        of life years lost annually because of DIPG is approximately 25,000 
        years of person life lost (calculated as the number of children 
        diagnosed by average of male and female life expectancy from that median 
        age, 300  x  80 = 25,000 years of person life lost annually); and
Whereas prognosis has not improved for children with DIPG in over 35 years: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``DIPG Awareness Week'';
            (2) encourages all people of the United States to become 
        more informed about diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and 
        pediatric brain cancer;
            (3) supports expanded research to better understand DIPG, 
        develop effective treatments, and provide comprehensive care 
        for children with DIPG and their families; and
            (4) encourages the NCI and other research funders to 
        elevate their consideration of mortality rate of a type of 
        cancer as well as the life years lost as factors considered 
        during the grant application process.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
