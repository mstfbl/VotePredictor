                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives on the challenges 
   posed to long-term stability in Lebanon by the conflict in Syria.

Whereas security and stability in Lebanon, a pluralistic democracy in the Middle 
        East, is in the interests of the United States and its allies in the 
        region;
Whereas over the past 10 years, the United States has provided robust assistance 
        to Lebanon, including training and equipment for the Lebanese Armed 
        Forces (LAF);
Whereas the conflict in Syria poses a significant threat to stability in Lebanon 
        as a result of violent attacks against Lebanese citizens perpetrated by 
        combatants active in Syria and a massive influx of refugees fleeing the 
        conflict;
Whereas the people of Lebanon have shown great generosity in welcoming more than 
        1,000,000 refugees from Syria, even as Lebanon struggles to accommodate 
        a refugee population equal to one-quarter of its native population;
Whereas Lebanon is hosting more refugees proportionally than any country in the 
        world;
Whereas the refugee crisis has further depressed the economy of Lebanon, which 
        has a national debt of approximately 140 percent of the gross domestic 
        product and economic growth rates lower than potential;
Whereas the LAF has been called into direct conflict with the Islamic State of 
        Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as a result of attacks carried out by that 
        terrorist group in Lebanon;
Whereas the conflict in Syria has put significant strains on the Lebanese 
        Government as it continues to confront the political deadlock that has 
        kept the Presidency vacant for more than two years;
Whereas the unique political constitution of Lebanon hinges on the distinct 
        demographic and social equilibrium of the country;
Whereas the prolongation of the conflict in Syria has the potential to upset the 
        precarious social and political balance in Lebanon;
Whereas the constitution of Lebanon is further undermined by undue foreign 
        influence, particularly by the Islamic Republic of Iran through its 
        terrorist proxy Hezbollah;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1701 in 2006, 
        calling for the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon and stresses 
        the importance of full control over Lebanon by the Government of 
        Lebanon; and
Whereas Hezbollah has violated and continues to violate such resolution, 
        including by replenishing its stock of rockets and missiles in South 
        Lebanon: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of United States and 
        international assistance to the people of Lebanon, in order to 
        build the capacity of Lebanon to provide services and security 
        for Lebanese citizens and particularly to curb the influence of 
        Hezbollah;
            (2) encourages continued coordination between the Secretary 
        of State, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
        and humanitarian organizations, to ensure that refugees from 
        the conflict in Syria, including those in Lebanon, are 
        supported in such a way as to mitigate any potentially 
        destabilizing effect on their host countries;
            (3) recognizes that it is in the interests of the United 
        States to support negotiations to end the conflict in Syria, 
        which would allow for the eventual return of the millions of 
        Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and other countries 
        around the world;
            (4) supports the full implementation of United Nations 
        Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006); and
            (5) recognizes the LAF as the sole institution entrusted 
        with the defense of the sovereignty of Lebanon and supports 
        United States partnerships with the LAF, particularly through 
        the global coalition to defeat the terrorist group ISIS.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
