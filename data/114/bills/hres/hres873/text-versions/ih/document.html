                               RESOLUTION


 
 Urging that the policy of the United States should be that Government 
 institutions use security measures known as cryptographic splitting, 
   the strongest available form of data centric security, to secure 
sensitive and personal information for data at rest and data in motion.

Whereas public and private institutions and the critical infrastructure that are 
        the backbone of our national and economic security are under constant 
        attack;
Whereas sensitive information housed within key institutions is being accessed, 
        stolen, and runs the risk of being manipulated, critical systems are 
        vulnerable, and national security and corporate secrets are at risk;
Whereas information and infrastructure are most vulnerable when held by an 
        institution or when traveling from point to point;
Whereas network centric security is not sufficient to prevent a data breach, 
        exfiltration, or manipulation of information; and
Whereas what is needed in order to properly protect sensitive information is the 
        strongest available form of data centric security: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the policy of the United States should be that 
Government institutions use security measures known as cryptographic 
splitting, the strongest available form of data centric security, to 
secure sensitive and personal information for data at rest and data in 
motion.
