                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of May 23rd as ``National Rosie the 
                             Riveter Day''.

Whereas National Rosie the Riveter Day is a collective national effort to raise 
        awareness of the 16 million women working during World War II;
Whereas Americans have chosen to honor female workers who contributed on the 
        home front during World War II;
Whereas these women left their homes to work or volunteer full-time in 
        factories, farms, shipyards, airplane factories, banks, and other 
        institutions in support of the military overseas;
Whereas these women worked with the USO and Red Cross, drove trucks, riveted 
        airplane parts, collected critical materials, rolled bandages, and 
        served on rationing boards;
Whereas it is fitting and proper to recognize and preserve the history and 
        legacy of working women, including volunteer women, during World War II 
        to promote cooperation and fellowship among such women and their 
        descendants;
Whereas these women and their descendants wish to further the advancement of 
        patriotic ideas, excellence in the workplace, and loyalty to the United 
        States of America; and
Whereas May 23rd would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National Rosie 
        the Riveter Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Rosie the 
        Riveter Day''; and
            (2) acknowledges the important role played by women in 
        World War II.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
