  Affirming and recognizing the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard 
Freedom Fighters and the people of Cambodia and Laos for their support 
and defense of the United States Armed Forces and freedom in Southeast 
                                 Asia.

Whereas the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters (also known 
        as ``southeast Asian veterans'') fought and died with United States 
        Armed Forces during the conflict in Southeast Asia;
Whereas the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters rescued 
        United States pilots shot down in enemy-controlled territory and 
        returned the pilots to safety;
Whereas the Khmer soldiers retrieved and prevented from falling into enemy hands 
        secret and sensitive information, technology, and equipment;
Whereas the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters captured and 
        destroyed enemy supplies and prevented enemy forces from using the 
        supplies to kill members of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters gathered and 
        provided to the United States Armed Forces intelligence about enemy 
        troop positions, movement, and strength;
Whereas the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters provided 
        food, shelter, and support to the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Khmer and National Armed Forces of Cambodia facilitated the 
        evacuation of the United States Embassy in Phnom Penh on April 12, 1975, 
        by continuing to fight Khmer Rouge forces as the forces advanced upon 
        the capital; and
Whereas veterans of the Khmer Mobile Guerrilla Forces, the Laotian Special 
        Guerrilla Units, the Khmer Republic Armed Forces, the Hmong, and the 
        Montagnard defended human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of 
        religion, and freedom of representation and association: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives affirms and recognizes 
the Khmer, Laotian, Hmong, and Montagnard Freedom Fighters and the 
people of Cambodia and Laos for their support and defense of the United 
States Armed Forces and freedom in Southeast Asia.
