                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of the month of June 2016 as 
``National Post-Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness Month'' and June 27, 
   2016, as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness Day''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, who 
        proudly serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom 
        of the people of the United States, and deserve the investment of every 
        possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, and 
        emotional well-being;
Whereas more than 2,000,000 members of the Armed Forces have deployed overseas 
        since the events of September 11, 2001, and have served in places such 
        as Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States have sustained a historically high 
        operational tempo since September 11, 2001, with many members of the 
        Armed Forces deploying overseas multiple times, placing those members at 
        high risk of post-traumatic stress injury/injuries (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``PTSI'' \\);
Whereas men and women of the Armed Forces and veterans who served before 
        September 11, 2001, remain at risk for PTSI and other mental health 
        injuries;
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs reports that--

    (1) since October 2001, more than 390,000 of the approximately 
1,160,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and Operation New Dawn who have received health care from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs have been diagnosed with PTSI;

    (2) in fiscal year 2014, more than 531,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 
veterans who sought care at a medical facility of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs received treatment for PTSI; and

    (3) of veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn who are receiving health care from 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 615,000 have received a 
diagnosis for at least 1 mental health injury;

Whereas many cases of PTSI remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to 
        a lack of awareness about PTSI and the persistent stigma associated with 
        mental health conditions;
Whereas exposure to military trauma can lead to PTSI;
Whereas PTSI significantly increases the risk of anxiety, depression, suicide, 
        homelessness, and drug- and alcohol-related injuries and deaths, 
        especially if left untreated;
Whereas public perceptions of PTSI or other mental health injuries create unique 
        challenges for veterans seeking employment;
Whereas the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as 
        well as the larger medical community, both private and public, have made 
        significant advances in the identification, prevention, diagnosis, and 
        treatment of PTSI and the symptoms of PTSI, but many challenges remain;
Whereas increased understanding of PTSI can help diminish the stigma attached to 
        this mental health issue, and additional efforts are needed to find 
        further ways to reduce this stigma--including an examination of how PTSI 
        is discussed in the United States and a recognition that PTSI is a 
        common injury that is treatable and repairable;
Whereas PTSI can result from any number of stressors other than combat, 
        including rape, sexual assault, battery, torture, confinement, child 
        abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane crashes, bombings, or natural 
        disaster, and affects approximately 8,000,000 adults in the United 
        States annually; and
Whereas the designation of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Injury Awareness 
        Month and a National Post-Traumatic Stress Injury Day will raise public 
        awareness about issues related to PTSI, reduce the stigma associated 
        with PTSI, and help ensure that those suffering from the invisible 
        wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Injury Awareness Month'' and ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Injury Awareness Day'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the entire 
        medical community, to educate members of the Armed Forces, 
        veterans, the families of members of the Armed Forces and 
        veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and 
        treatment of post-traumatic stress injury/injuries (PTSI);
            (3) encourages commanders of the Armed Forces to support 
        appropriate treatment of men and women of the Armed Forces who 
        are diagnosed with PTSI; and
            (4) respectfully requests that the Clerk of the House of 
        Representatives transmit a copy of this resolution to the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 <all>
