                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives in disapproval of 
 the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran 
                           on July 14, 2015.

Whereas a nuclear-capable Iran threatens United States national security and 
        global stability;
Whereas since the 1980s, Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-documented 
        pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to acquire a nuclear weapons 
        capability;
Whereas it is the policy of the United States to prevent Iran from acquiring a 
        nuclear weapons capability;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted 6 resolutions since 2006 
        demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of all uranium 
        enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and its full cooperation 
        with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on all outstanding 
        issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those concerning 
        the possible military dimensions of its nuclear programs;
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry has publicly stated that the United States 
        does not recognize Iran's self-proclaimed right to enrich uranium;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted multiple resolutions 
        demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of heavy-water 
        production efforts, including the heavy-water reactor at Arak;
Whereas Iran is developing an arsenal of advanced long-range ballistic missiles, 
        including some already capable of reaching India, North Africa, western 
        China, and parts of eastern Europe;
Whereas, on June 9, 2010, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 
        1929, which states that ``Iran shall not undertake any activity related 
        to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.'';
Whereas the United States Department of State has designated Iran as a state 
        sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and has characterized Iran as the ``most 
        active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world;
Whereas Iran is a world leader in human rights violations, including the 
        persecution of religious minorities and imprisonment of United States 
        citizens;
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed to between the P5+1 and 
        Iran on July 14, 2015, fails to require Iran to fully dismantle its 
        nuclear program;
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action provides Iran with billions of 
        dollars in additional sanctions relief and unfrozen assets;
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action allows key restraints on Iran's 
        nuclear program to expire within 10 to 15 years, including those on 
        Iran's domestic uranium enrichment program and heavy-water reactor at 
        Arak;
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action allows for lifting international 
        restrictions on Iran with regards to conventional military arms and 
        ballistic missiles;
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action fails to address Iran's egregious 
        human rights record, Iran's role as the world's leading state-sponsor of 
        international terrorism, and Iran's unjust imprisonment of innocent 
        United States citizens; and
Whereas the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 passed by the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate and signed into law on May 22, 2015 
        (Public Law 114-17), provides Congress with the ability to vote to 
        disapprove the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its firm disapproval of the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action agreed to by the P5+1 and Iran on 
        July 14, 2015;
            (2) reaffirms its commitment to prevent Iran from ever 
        acquiring a nuclear weapons capability; and
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to encouraging global 
        stability and security by strongly supporting strategic 
        regional allies.
                                 <all>
