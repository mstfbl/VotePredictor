                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for a uniform adoption process of children from 
foster care and promoting the enactment by all States of the Interstate 
 Compact for the Placement of Children to ensure more children in the 
     United States are placed in safe, loving, and permanent homes.

Whereas there are over 400,000 children in foster care in the United States and 
        107,000 children waiting to be adopted;
Whereas the median age for foster children waiting to be adopted is 7 years old;
Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster care is 
        approximately 2 years;
Whereas domestic adoptions with public child welfare agency involvement 
        represent approximately 40 percent of all adoptions;
Whereas families seeking to adopt are expected to undergo a home study, which 
        serves to ensure their suitability;
Whereas the adoption application and content of a home study varies from State-
        to-State, it always involves personal interviews by an adoption case 
        worker, an examination of their home, training related to adoption, and 
        information on their health history and family income;
Whereas while 4 in 10 people in the United States have considered adoption, but 
        are concerned about the complexity and length of time adopting children 
        from foster care;
Whereas the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws is a 
        nonprofit, nonpartisan organization of more than 300 lawyers, 
        legislators, judges, and academics who propose legislation to the States 
        in areas subject to State authority, including all aspects of family 
        law;
Whereas after nearly 5 years of drafting, debate, and discussions with adoption 
        and child welfare experts, in August 1994 the National Conference of 
        Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved a proposed Uniform Adoption 
        Act for submission to State legislatures;
Whereas in 2005, the Uniform Laws Commission designated the Adoption Act from 
        1994 as a ``model'' rather than a uniform law keeping State adoption 
        policies varied and incongruent;
Whereas the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children has only been 
        enacted by 9 States and cannot be considered nationally in effect until 
        passed by 35 States;
Whereas there is a need for coordination between the Interstate Compact for the 
        Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Juveniles, the 
        Interstate Compact on Adoption and Medical Assistance and other compacts 
        affecting the placement of and which provide services to children;
Whereas the Federal Government should provide for a State's continuing legal 
        jurisdiction and responsibility for placement and care of a child that 
        it would have had if the placement were intrastate; and
Whereas Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives have sought to 
        remove barriers to intrastate and interstate adoptions and encourage a 
        national standard for the adoption process and it has not been acted on 
        legislatively: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports a uniform adoption process of children from 
        foster care; and
            (2) promotes the enactment by all States of the Interstate 
        Compact for the Placement of Children to ensure more children 
        in the United States are placed in safe, loving, and permanent 
        homes.
