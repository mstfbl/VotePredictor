                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national 
                               treasure.

Whereas magic is an art form with the unique power and potential to impact the 
        lives of all people;
Whereas magic enables people to experience the impossible;
Whereas magic is used to inspire and bring wonder and happiness to others;
Whereas magic has had a significant impact on other art forms;
Whereas magic, like the great art forms of dance, literature, theater, film, and 
        the visual arts, allows people to experience something that transcends 
        the written word;
Whereas many technological advances can be directly traced to the influential 
        work of magicians;
Whereas futurist Arthur C. Clarke claimed that any sufficiently advanced 
        technology is indistinguishable from magic;
Whereas one of the greatest artists of all time, Leonardo da Vinci, was inspired 
        by magic and co-wrote one of the very first books on magic in the late 
        15th century;
Whereas modern cinema would not exist today without the innovative work of the 
        accomplished magician Georges Melies;
Whereas magicians are visual storytellers who seamlessly interweave elements of 
        mystery, wonder, emotion, and expression;
Whereas magic is an outstanding artistic model of individual expression;
Whereas magic fulfills some of the highest ideals and aspirations of our country 
        by encouraging people to question what they believe and see;
Whereas magic is a unifying force across cultural, religious, ethnic, and age 
        differences in our diverse Nation;
Whereas magic is an art that transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary;
Whereas the American magicians Harry Houdini and David Copperfield have been the 
        most successful magicians of the past two centuries;
Whereas David Copperfield, introduced to magic as a boy growing up in New 
        Jersey, has been named a Living Legend by the Library of Congress;
Whereas David Copperfield, with 21 Emmy Awards, 11 Guinness World Records, and 
        over four billion dollars in ticket sales, has impacted every aspect of 
        the global entertainment industry;
Whereas David Copperfield, through his magic, inspires great positive change in 
        the lives of Americans;
Whereas people consistently leave David Copperfield's live magic show with a 
        different perspective than when they entered;
Whereas Rebecca Brown of Portland, Oregon, left a David Copperfield magic show 
        with a newfound inspiration to pursue her lifelong, unfulfilled passion 
        for dance;
Whereas three months after Rebecca Brown attended the David Copperfield magic 
        show, she performed her first choreographed recital in Portland, 
        Oregon's Pioneer Square;
Whereas programs such as Project Magic, created by David Copperfield, use magic 
        as a form of therapy for children with physical, psychological, and 
        social disabilities;
Whereas learning magic through programs such as Project Magic can help these 
        children improve their physical and mental dexterity and increase their 
        confidence;
Whereas learning magic through programs such as Project Magic helps these 
        children realize that they are no longer less able than their peers;
Whereas programs such as Project Magic teach these children that they are more 
        capable and have a newfound ability to do what others cannot;
Whereas cities such as Wylie, Texas, and its mayor, Eric Hogue, recognize and 
        promote the art of magic with official proclamations, summer educational 
        programs, and the first festival dedicated to the art of magic in the 
        State of Texas;
Whereas Mayor Eric Hogue, who learned the art of magic as a child, continues to 
        use those skills to teach elementary school students about the different 
        roles and responsibilities of local government;
Whereas magic is timeless in appeal and requires only the capacity to dream;
Whereas magic transcends any barrier of race, religion, language, or culture;
Whereas magic has not been properly recognized as a great American art form, nor 
        has it been accorded the institutional status on a national level 
        commensurate with its value and importance;
Whereas there is not an effective national effort to support and preserve magic;
Whereas documentation and archival support required by such a great art form has 
        yet to be systematically applied to the field of magic; and
Whereas it is in the best interest of the national welfare to preserve and 
        celebrate the unique art form of magic: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes magic as a rare and valuable art form and 
        national treasure; and
            (2) supports efforts to make certain that magic is 
        preserved, understood, and promulgated.
