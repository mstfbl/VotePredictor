with. All points of order against consideration of each such bill are 
waived. General debate on each such bill shall be confined to that bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. 
After general debate each such bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in each 
such bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived.
    (b) During consideration of each such bill for amendment--
            (1) each amendment, other than amendments provided for in 
        paragraph (2), shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally 
        divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and 
        shall not be subject to amendment except as provided in 
        paragraph (2);
            (2) no pro forma amendment shall be in order except that 
        the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
        Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to 10 
        pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of 
        debate; and
            (3) the chair of the Committee of the Whole may accord 
        priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member 
        offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the 
        portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose 
        in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed shall be 
        considered as read.
    (c) When the committee rises and reports any such bill back to the 
House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on that bill and amendments 
thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion 
to recommit with or without instructions.

resolution are as follows:
