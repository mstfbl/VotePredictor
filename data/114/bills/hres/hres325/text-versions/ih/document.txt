                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the month of June as ``Immigrant Heritage Month,'' a 
  celebration of the accomplishments and contributions immigrants and 
  their children have made in shaping the history, strengthening the 
        economy, and enriching the culture of the United States.

Whereas the United States has always been a nation of immigrants, and throughout 
        the Nation's history, immigrants and their children from around the 
        globe have kept our workforce vibrant, our businesses on the cutting 
        edge, and helped to build the greatest economic engine in the world;
Whereas the entrepreneurial drive and spirit of the Nation is built on our 
        diversity of origins;
Whereas it is what drew the first people to the United States and what continues 
        to drive business in the Nation;
Whereas United States success is a result of our many distinct experiences, not 
        in spite of it;
Whereas as a nation of immigrants, we must remember the generations of pioneers 
        that helped lay the railroads and build cities, develop new industries 
        and fuel the Information Age, from the telegraph to the smartphone;
Whereas immigrants start more than a quarter of all new businesses in the United 
        States, and immigrants and their children start over 40 percent of 
        Fortune 500 companies;
Whereas these businesses collectively employ tens of millions of United States 
        citizens and generate more than $4.5 trillion in annual revenue;
Whereas the Nation's immigrants contribute greatly to the advances in technology 
        and sciences;
Whereas 14 percent of all employed college graduates and 50 percent of Ph.D.s 
        working in math and computer science occupations are immigrants;
Whereas between 2006 and 2012, 44 percent of new tech startups in Silicon 
        Valley, widely known as the international hub for technological 
        development and innovation, had at least one immigrant founder;
Whereas immigrants to the Nation plant, cultivate, and harvest the rich 
        diversity of agriculture products available today from the United States 
        farmlands;
Whereas each immigrant farm employee supports two to three full-time jobs in 
        processing, transportation, and retail;
Whereas immigrants involved in agricultural production aid in the Nation's food 
        security and independence;
Whereas the work of immigrants has directly enriched United States culture by 
        influencing the performing arts from Broadway to Hollywood, as well as 
        academia, art, music, literature, media, fashion, cuisine, customs, and 
        cultural celebrations enjoyed across the Nation;
Whereas generations of immigrants have come to the shores from all corners of 
        the globe and tirelessly fought for United States independence and 
        defended our ideals, since the earliest days as a Nation;
Whereas more than 30,000 lawful permanent residents are serving in the United 
        States Armed Forces;
Whereas since 2002, more than 102,000 men and women, including individuals 
        serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, Germany, Japan and elsewhere, 
        have become citizens while wearing the uniform of the United States 
        military;
Whereas Congress represents a rich diversity of communities across the country 
        and works closely with a variety of diaspora leaders from more than 60 
        ethnic caucuses to ensure that the voices of United States citizens from 
        all backgrounds are heard; and
Whereas the United States was founded on the universal promise that we are all 
        created equal: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes ``Immigrant Heritage Month'' in honor of the 
        accomplishments and role of immigrants and their children in 
        shaping the history and culture of the United States;
            (2) pledges to celebrate immigrant contributions to, and 
        immigrant heritage in, each district; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to 
        commemorate the history of immigrants in the United States and 
        to always remember the Nation's immigrant roots.
