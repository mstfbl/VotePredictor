                               RESOLUTION


 
Providing for the safety and security of the Iranian dissidents living 
in Camp Liberty/Hurriya in Iraq and awaiting resettlement by the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and permitting use of their own 
                assets to assist in their resettlement.

Whereas approximately 2,000 unarmed members of the Iranian opposition movement, 
        the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) reside in Camp Liberty/Hurriya awaiting 
        resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
        (UNHCR), which has recognized them as ``persons of concern'' and ``in 
        need of international protection'';
Whereas these residents oppose the clerical regime in Tehran and, as a result of 
        that opposition, live in constant danger of attack from pro-Iranian 
        forces;
Whereas these residents moved from the former Camp Ashraf to Camp Liberty/
        Hurriya, which is adjacent to the Baghdad International Airport, 
        following a December 2011 Memorandum of Understanding reached between 
        the United Nations and the Government of Iraq, and brokered by the 
        Government of the United States, for the express purpose of resettling 
        them as refugees to third countries;
Whereas the residents left behind valuable personal property and assets at Camp 
        Ashraf, under the explicit agreement that they would retain title to 
        such property and assets;
Whereas in 2004, the United States recognized the residents as ``protected 
        persons'' under the Fourth Geneva Convention and pledged to protect the 
        residents until their final disposition;
Whereas the United States turned over control and responsibility of the 
        residents to the Government of Iraq in early 2009, as reflected in the 
        United States Embassy Statement on Transfer of Security Responsibility 
        for Camp Ashraf of December 28, 2008;
Whereas the residents have come under attack several times since their 
        relocation to Camp Liberty/Hurriya;
Whereas Iraqi forces who bear responsibility for guarding the camp have failed 
        to protect its residents from repeated attacks;
Whereas most recently, during the evening of October 29, 2015, the residents of 
        Camp Liberty came under rocket attack, with 80 missiles killing 24 
        residents and injuring dozens more;
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry strongly condemned the October 29 attack, 
        describing it as a ``brutal, senseless terrorist attack'', and calling 
        for ``find[ing] the perpetrators and hold[ing] them accountable for the 
        attack'';
Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General strongly condemned these attacks 
        and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice;
Whereas the UNHCR described the attacks as ``most deplorable'';
Whereas 140 residents have died as a result of the attacks, 7 have been 
        abducted, and more than 1,300 wounded;
Whereas groups affiliated with the Iranian regime's Revolutionary Guard Qods 
        Force have claimed responsibility for attacks and warned that more would 
        follow if the residents did not leave Iraq;
Whereas Iraqi security forces are permanently stationed around Camp Liberty/
        Hurriya, despite their past violence against the unarmed residents;
Whereas the security of Camp Liberty/Hurriya is clearly inadequate to protect 
        the residents from armed assault and rocket attack;
Whereas the residents are opposed to the development in Iran of a nuclear 
        weapons capability and have provided valuable intelligence concerning 
        efforts by the Government of Iran both to establish a nuclear weapons 
        capability and to supply paramilitary groups in Iraq with Improvised 
        Explosive Devices (IEDs) and Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs);
Whereas the United States Department of State in its August 29, 2012, statement 
        stated, ``The United States also reiterates its commitment to support 
        the safety and security of the residents throughout the process of their 
        relocation outside of Iraq'';
Whereas hundreds of the residents have been resettled to Europe;
Whereas the Government of Albania has generously resettled hundreds of residents 
        from Camp Liberty/Hurriya in Iraq to Albania in demonstration of 
        international solidarity in caring for a vulnerable population; and
Whereas the residents have been unable to access or sell their property 
        remaining at Camp Ashraf for the purposes of supporting themselves or 
        funding their resettlement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the attacks against the residents of Camp 
        Liberty/Hurriya;
            (2) urges the Government of Iraq to bring to justice those 
        responsible for the attacks;
            (3) calls on the Government of the United States to work 
        with the Government of Iraq to bring Camp Liberty/Hurriya to 
        the same level of protection as that of the adjacent Baghdad 
        International Airport to deter future attacks on the camp and 
        ensure safety and security of the residents;
            (4) calls on the Government of the United States to work 
        with the Government of Iraq to ensure that the personnel 
        responsible for providing for the security of Camp Liberty/
        Hurriya are adequately equipped and vetted to ensure that they 
        are not now, and have not been previously affiliated, directly 
        or indirectly, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods 
        Force or other organizations responsible for past attacks;
            (5) urges the Government of Iraq to ensure access to food, 
        clean water, medical assistance, electricity, equipment, and 
        such supplies that are necessary to sustain the residents;
            (6) calls on the Government of the United States to work 
        with the Government of Iraq to make all reasonable efforts to 
        facilitate the residents' access and ability to sell their 
        property and assets remaining at Camp Ashraf for the purpose of 
        funding their costs of living and resettlement out of Iraq;
            (7) urges the Government of the United States to work with 
        the Government of Iraq and the United Nations High Commissioner 
        for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure that Camp Liberty/Hurriya 
        residents, without exception, are safely resettled outside of 
        Iraq and Iran according to the terms of the December 2011 
        Memorandum of Understanding; and
            (8) calls on the Government of the United States to work 
        with the Government of Albania and the UNHCR to facilitate and 
        provide suitable locations for housing of the remaining Camp 
        Liberty/Hurriya residents in Albania until such time when the 
        residents become self-sufficient in meeting their residential 
        needs in Albania.
