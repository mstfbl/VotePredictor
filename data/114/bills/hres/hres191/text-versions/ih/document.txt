Expressing support for the designation of April 10, 2015, as ``Venture 
                         Smith's Freedom Day''.

Whereas 250 years ago, in the year 1765, Venture Smith, at the age of 36, 
        purchased his freedom;
Whereas Venture Smith went on to free his family from the bondage of slavery;
Whereas Venture Smith went on to become a successful businessman in the State of 
        Connecticut; and
Whereas, April 10, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Venture 
        Smith's Freedom Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Venture Smith's Freedom Day'', which would recognize 
the 250th anniversary of Venture Smith purchasing his freedom and going 
on to become a successful businessman in Connecticut.
                                 <all>
