                               RESOLUTION


 
       Expressing support for States to adopt ``Racheal's Law''.

Whereas there are approximately 293,000 victims of sexual assault every year;
Whereas 82 percent of sexual assaults were perpetrated by a non-stranger;
Whereas 46 percent of rapists who were released from prison were re-arrested 
        within 3 years of their release for another crime; of which 18.6 percent 
        was for a violent offense;
Whereas victims of sexual assault are 3 times more likely to suffer from 
        depression, 6 times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, 13 times more likely to abuse alcohol, 26 times more likely to 
        abuse drugs, and 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide; and
Whereas victim interaction with their offender can cause further emotional 
        trauma: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) encourages States to ensure that victims of rape or 
        sexual assault can file and obtain a restraining order against 
        the guilty party for an indefinite period of time without the 
        necessity of renewal or refiling; and
            (2) encourages States to ensure that victims of rape or 
        sexual assault can be represented by an attorney instead of 
        being physically present during hearings involving their 
        convicted attacker.
                                 <all>
