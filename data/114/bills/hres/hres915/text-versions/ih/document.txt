                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to 
                             Marcus Garvey.

Whereas Marcus Mosiah Garvey was born in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on August 17, 
        1887, and emigrated to the United States where he founded the Universal 
        Negro Improvement Association;
Whereas Marcus Garvey was the father of the largest African-American movement 
        for human rights and economic self-sufficiency of all time, attracting 
        millions of followers in the United States, the Caribbean, Latin 
        America, Africa, and Europe;
Whereas Marcus Garvey's philosophy inspired some of the world's great Black 
        leaders;
Whereas leading a movement for economic independence among Black Americans, 
        Marcus Garvey became the target of surveillance and harassment by United 
        States Government law enforcement agencies;
Whereas Marcus Garvey was prosecuted and convicted of mail fraud, imprisoned, 
        and later, deported to Jamaica;
Whereas the case against Marcus Garvey was politically motivated, the charges 
        unsubstantiated, and his conviction unjust;
Whereas millions of petitioners have appealed for his exoneration;
Whereas Marcus Garvey is recognized as a national hero in his native Jamaica, 
        and as a towering figure in nations around the world; and
Whereas Marcus Garvey's life and contributions to the United States should be 
        recognized and appropriate steps taken to restore his name and 
        reputation in this country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) Marcus Garvey was innocent of the charges brought 
        against him by the United States Government;
            (2) Marcus Garvey was and should be recognized 
        internationally as a leader and thinker in the struggle for 
        human rights; and
            (3) the President should take appropriate measures within 
        his power to clear Marcus Garvey's good name.
                                 <all>
