                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that domestically 
grown flowers support the farmers, small businesses, jobs, and economy 
 of the United States, enhance the ability of the people of the United 
States to honor their mothers on Mother's Day, and that the White House 
         should strive to showcase domestically grown flowers.

Whereas the people of the United States have a long history of using flowers and 
        greens grown in the United States to bring beauty to important events 
        and express affection for loved ones;
Whereas consumers spend more than $25,000,000,000 each year on floral products, 
        including garden plants, bedding, indoor plants, and cut flowers;
Whereas 30 percent of households in the United States purchase fresh cut flowers 
        and greens from more than 16,000 florists and floral establishments each 
        year;
Whereas the people of the United States increasingly want to support 
        domestically produced foods and agricultural products, yet 74 percent of 
        the people of the United States do not know where the flowers they 
        purchase are grown, and 58 percent would prefer to buy locally grown 
        flowers given the choice;
Whereas in response to increased demand, the ``Certified American Grown 
        Flowers'' logo was created in July 2014, in order to educate and empower 
        consumers to purchase flowers from domestic producers;
Whereas, as of April 2015, millions of stems of domestically grown flowers are 
        now Certified American Grown;
Whereas domestic flower farmers produce thousands of varieties of flowers across 
        the United States, such as peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in 
        California, lupines in Maine, tulips in Washington, lilies in Oregon, 
        and larkspur in Texas;
Whereas the 5 flower varieties with the highest United States production are 
        tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, irises, and gladiolas;
Whereas people in every State have access to domestically grown flowers, yet 
        only 1 of 5 flowers sold in the United States is domestically grown;
Whereas the domestic cut flower industry creates almost $42,000,000 in economic 
        impact daily and supports hundreds of growers, thousands of small 
        businesses, and tens of thousands of jobs in the United States;
Whereas more people in the United States are expressing interest in growing 
        flowers locally, which has resulted in an approximately 20-percent 
        increase in the number of domestic cut flower farms since 2007;
Whereas most domestic cut flowers and greens are sold in the United States 
        within 24 to 48 hours after harvest and last longer than flowers shipped 
        longer distances;
Whereas in 2014, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama 
        highlighted their support for domestically grown flowers at the White 
        House State Dinner with French President Franccois Hollande, the only 
        White House State Dinner that year;
Whereas the 2014 White House State Dinner featured quince branch from 
        Mississippi, weeping willow from New Jersey, Scotch broom from Virginia, 
        iris from California, and alocasia, equisetum, nandina, and green 
        liriope from Florida;
Whereas flower-giving has been a holiday tradition in the United States for 
        generations;
Whereas Mother's Day and Valentine's Day are 2 of the 3 top flower-giving 
        holidays in the United States;
Whereas 38 percent of the people in the United States, spending more than 
        $2,000,000,000, buy flowers on Valentine's Day; and
Whereas flowers are even more popular on Mother's Day than on Valentine's Day, 
        and in 2014, \2/3\ of people in the United States celebrating Mother's 
        Day purchased flowers, spending more than $2,300,000,000: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) purchasing flowers grown in the United States supports 
        the farmers, small businesses, jobs, and economy of the United 
        States;
            (2) flowers and greens grown in the United States are a 
        vital and integral part of the agricultural industry of the 
        United States;
            (3) flowers grown in the United States enhance the ability 
        of Americans to honor their mothers on Mother's Day; and
            (4) the White House should strive to showcase flowers and 
        greens grown in the United States to show support for the 
        flower breeders, farmers, processors, and distributors of the 
        United States.
