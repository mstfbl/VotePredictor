                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of the month of September as 
  ``Rheumatic Disease Awareness Month'', in recognition of the costs 
imposed by rheumatic diseases, the need for increased medical research, 
       and the quality care provided by trained rheumatologists.

Whereas rheumatic diseases are chronic, progressive, painful conditions and the 
        leading cause of disability in the United States;
Whereas rheumatic diseases now affect nearly 1 in 4 people in the United States 
        and are expected to affect an estimated 78,000,000 people in the United 
        States by the year 2040;
Whereas 300,000 children live with some form of rheumatic disease;
Whereas it is estimated that the economic burden of rheumatic disease is at 
        least $128,000,000,000 annually, including more than $80,000,000,000 in 
        medical expenditures and $47,000,000,000 in annual indirect costs such 
        as lost earnings;
Whereas research suggests the cause of rheumatic disease is a combination of 
        genetic and environmental factors, but the exact cause of these diseases 
        is still unknown;
Whereas the symptoms of rheumatic diseases vary depending on the individual and 
        the disease, but may include joint or muscle pain, inflammation, 
        swelling, redness or stiffness, eye irritation and inflammation, general 
        fatigue, malaise, and fevers, hair loss, dry eyes or mouth, chest pain, 
        seizures, or stroke;
Whereas there is currently no cure for rheumatic diseases, but medical research 
        breakthroughs have led to treatments and therapies that can dramatically 
        improve the quality of life for those living with rheumatic diseases;
Whereas rheumatologists, researchers, patients, caregivers, and other advocates 
        are working to improve the quality of life for people living with 
        rheumatic diseases;
Whereas health care policies, research, education, and community support 
        services are needed to ensure patients receive timely, affordable, safe, 
        and effective treatments and have access to trained rheumatologists who 
        can provide quality care to those living with these diseases; and
Whereas September would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Rheumatic 
        Disease Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Rheumatic Disease 
        Awareness Month'', in recognition of the costs imposed by 
        rheumatic diseases, the need for increased medical research, 
        and the quality care provided by trained rheumatologists;
            (2) pledges to celebrate the contributions of trained 
        rheumatologists in each district; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to celebrate 
        the contributions of researchers and health care providers in 
        serving those living with rheumatic diseases and to support 
        efforts to find an effective cure.
