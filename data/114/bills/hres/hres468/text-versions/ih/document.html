                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of October 8, 2015, as ``National 
                     Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day''.

Whereas hydrogen, which has an atomic mass of 1.008, is the most abundant 
        chemical substance in the universe;
Whereas the United States is a world leader in the development and deployment of 
        fuel cell and hydrogen technologies;
Whereas hydrogen fuel cells played an instrumental role in the United States 
        space program, helping the United States achieve the mission of landing 
        a man on the moon;
Whereas private industry, Federal and State governments, national laboratories, 
        and universities continue to improve fuel cell and hydrogen technologies 
        to address our most pressing energy, environmental, and economic issues;
Whereas fuel cells utilizing hydrogen and hydrogen-rich fuels to generate 
        electricity are clean, efficient, resilient technologies being sold for 
        stationary and backup power, zero-emission light duty motor vehicles and 
        buses, industrial vehicles, and portable power;
Whereas stationary fuel cells are being placed in service for continuous and 
        backup power to provide business and energy consumers with reliable 
        power in the event of grid outages;
Whereas stationary fuel cells can help reduce water use compared to traditional 
        power generation technologies;
Whereas fuel cell electric light duty motor vehicles and buses that utilize 
        hydrogen can completely replicate the experience of internal combustion 
        vehicles including comparable range and refueling times;
Whereas hydrogen fuel cell industrial vehicles are being deployed at logistical 
        hubs and warehouses across the country and are also being exported to 
        facilities in Europe and Asia;
Whereas hydrogen is a non-toxic gas that can be derived from a variety of 
        domestically available traditional and renewable resources, including 
        solar, wind, biogas and the abundant supply of natural gas in the United 
        States;
Whereas hydrogen and fuel cells can store energy to help enhance the grid and 
        maximize opportunities to deploy renewable energy;
Whereas the United States currently produces and uses more than 11,000,000 
        metric tons of hydrogen per year;
Whereas engineers and safety code and standard professionals have developed 
        consensus-based protocols for safe delivery, handling, and use of 
        hydrogen; and
Whereas, October 8, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as 
        ``National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day''.
