                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing and celebrating the centennial of the United States Navy 
                                Reserve.

Whereas the United States Navy Reserve was established on March 3, 1915, 
        pursuant to the Naval Appropriations Act of 1916;
Whereas the establishment of the Navy Reserve was due to a determined campaign 
        by then Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and his assistant, future 
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt;
Whereas the vigilance of the members of the Navy Reserve has been instrumental 
        to the preservation of the freedom, security, and prosperity enjoyed by 
        the people of the United States;
Whereas the Navy Reserve has always acted as a bolstering support system for the 
        regular Navy;
Whereas the Navy Reserve provides essential naval war fighting capabilities and 
        expertise, which are strategically aligned with mission requirements, as 
        members of the Navy Reserve continue to be valued for their readiness, 
        innovation, and agility;
Whereas by 1945 (30 years into its existence) over 3 million sailors had served 
        in World War I or World War II as members of the Navy Reserve;
Whereas, over the years, the Navy Reserve has assisted the regular Navy in 
        creating and sustaining high technology ships, while also providing 
        sailors for almost every armed conflict since World War I;
Whereas the role of the United States as a world leader requires a military 
        force that is well-trained, well-equipped, and appropriately sized;
Whereas the people of the United States will forever be in debt to the men and 
        women of the Navy Reserve as they have, and will continue to, bolster 
        the United States with the world's strongest Navy;
Whereas the Navy Reserve has and continues to represent its motto of ``Ready 
        Then. Ready Now. Ready Always.''; and
Whereas the Navy Reserve, in executing a range of missions over the years, has 
        continued to display to the world a number of core American values, 
        including compassion, to show its flexibility by responding to 
        unforeseen events, and to demonstrate its ability to provide support to 
        the United States Armed Forces and project a stabilizing force: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the role and wisdom of Secretary of the Navy 
        Josephus Daniels and future President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 
        helping to establish the Navy Reserve;
            (2) recognizes and celebrates the centennial of the Navy 
        Reserve and the role of the Navy Reserve as a component of the 
        United States Armed Forces;
            (3) commends the efforts of the Navy Reserve in supporting 
        the Navy, Marine Corps, and Joint Force, including the 
        mobilization of Reserve sailors to support overseas contingency 
        operations; and
            (4) honors the sacrifices made and services rendered by the 
        members of the Navy Reserve who protect and serve the United 
        States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
