                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the of House of Representatives that the United 
States postal facility network is an asset of significant value and the 
   United States Postal Service should take appropriate measures to 
maintain, modernize and fully utilize the existing post office network 
                          for economic growth.

Whereas the postal facility network is an integral part of universal service and 
        should be modernized to make universal service relevant for the 21st 
        century;
Whereas the closure of post offices in rural communities would create an 
        economic burden for people in the United States that depend on universal 
        service for communication, package services, and non-typical postal 
        services;
Whereas the closure process of post offices does not adequately take into 
        account community input;
Whereas post office boxes represent the most economic and secure choice of mail 
        delivery;
Whereas post offices are recognized as secure and trustworthy, and could 
        function as the location for other government services, community 
        events, and emergency services; and
Whereas post offices have become a part of the identity of rural communities, 
        and provide a significant social value: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures 
to modernize and maintain a post office network.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
