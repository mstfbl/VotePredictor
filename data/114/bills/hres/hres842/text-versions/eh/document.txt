H. Res. 842

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                     September 9, 2016.
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, while Americans were attending to their daily 
        routines, terrorists hijacked four civilian aircraft, crashing two of 
        them into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third 
        into the Pentagon near Washington, DC, and a fourth was prevented from 
        also being used as a weapon against America by brave passengers who 
        placed their country above their own lives;
Whereas thousands of innocent Americans were killed and injured as a result of 
        these attacks, including the passengers and crew of the four aircraft, 
        workers in the World Trade Center and in the Pentagon, rescue workers, 
        and bystanders;
Whereas the crewmembers of United Flight 175, American Flight 11, American 
        Flight 77, and United Flight 93 acted as first responders, reporting the 
        first intelligence of a war the United States did not know it was 
        fighting and sacrificing their own lives to protect the United States 
        and the lives of countless others;
Whereas 15 years later the country continues to, and shall forever, mourn their 
        tragic loss and honor their memory;
Whereas these attacks destroyed both towers of the World Trade Center, as well 
        as adjacent buildings, and seriously damaged the Pentagon;
Whereas these attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist attacks ever launched 
        against the United States, and, by targeting symbols of American 
        strength and success, were intended to assail the principles, values, 
        and freedoms of the United States and the American people, intimidate 
        our Nation, and weaken its resolve;
Whereas memorials have been constructed to honor the victims of these attacks at 
        the Pentagon, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and on the World Trade 
        Center grounds, so that Americans and people from around the world can 
        visit to mourn those lost and to pay tribute to the heroic action and 
        sacrifice of those who have served our communities and our country in 
        the years since the attacks;
Whereas 15 years after September 11, 2001, the United States continues to fight 
        terrorists and other extremists who threaten America and her friends and 
        allies;
Whereas successive Congresses have passed and President Bush and President Obama 
        have signed numerous laws to assist victims of terrorism, protect our 
        Nation, combat terrorism at home and abroad, and support the members of 
        the Armed Forces who courageously defend the United States;
Whereas by the tireless efforts of our intelligence, military, and law 
        enforcement professionals, the United States has been able to 
        significantly degrade the al Qaida network, by taking into custody or 
        killing senior al Qaida leaders, operational managers, and key 
        facilitators, and owes a debt of gratitude to the focused and persistent 
        efforts of all those personnel involved in the removal of Osama bin 
        Laden;
Whereas the terrorist attacks that have occurred around the world since 
        September 11, 2001, remind us of the hateful inhumanity of terrorism and 
        the ongoing threat it poses to freedom, justice, and the rule of law;
Whereas United States law enforcement and intelligence agencies and allies of 
        the United States around the world have worked together to detect and 
        disrupt terrorist networks and numerous terror plots since September 11, 
        2001;
Whereas the Nation is indebted to the brave military, intelligence, law 
        enforcement, and civilian personnel serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
        elsewhere in advancement of United States national interests;
Whereas thousands of families have lost loved ones in the defense of freedom and 
        liberty against the tyranny of terror; and
Whereas the passage of 15 years has not diminished the pain caused by the 
        senseless loss of nearly 3,000 persons killed on September 11, 2001: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes September 11 as a day of solemn commemoration;
            (2) extends again its deepest sympathies to the thousands of 
        innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and to 
        their families, friends, and loved ones;
            (3) honors the heroism and the sacrifices of United States military 
        and civilian personnel and their families who have sacrificed much, 
        including their lives and health, in defense of their country;
            (4) credits the heroism of first responders, law enforcement 
        personnel, State and local officials, volunteers, and others who aided 
        the victims of these attacks and, in so doing, bravely risked their own 
        lives and long-term health;
            (5) expresses thanks and gratitude to the foreign leaders and 
        citizens of all nations who have assisted and continue to stand in 
        solidarity with the United States against terrorism in the aftermath of 
        the attacks on September 11, 2001, and asks them to continue to stand 
        with the United States against international terrorism;
            (6) commends the military and intelligence personnel involved in the 
        removal of Osama bin Laden;
            (7) reasserts its commitment to opposing violent extremism arrayed 
        against American interests and to providing the United States military, 
        intelligence, and law enforcement communities with the resources and 
        support to do so effectively and safely;
            (8) vows that it will continue to identify, intercept, and disrupt 
        terrorists and their activities;
            (9) reaffirms that the American people will never forget the 
        sacrifices made on September 11, 2001, and will never bow to terrorist 
        demands; and
            (10) declares that when Congress adjourns today, it stands adjourned 
        out of respect to the victims of the terrorist attacks.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
