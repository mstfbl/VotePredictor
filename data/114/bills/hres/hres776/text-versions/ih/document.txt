                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the month of November as ``U.S. 
 Navy Aircraft Carrier Month'', in celebration of the accomplishments 
and contributions of United States Navy aircraft carriers in defending 
the freedom of the United States, protecting the security of the Nation 
    and its allies, responding to crisis and spurring technological 
                              innovation.

Whereas the month of November is rich with naval aviation and aircraft carrier 
        historical milestones illustrating the United States spirit of freedom, 
        strength, innovation, determination, and generosity;
Whereas naval aviation was born in the United States when Eugene Ely launched 
        from the deck of a United States Navy ship on November 14, 1910, in a 
        Curtiss Model D;
Whereas, on November 5, 1915, Cpt. Henry C. Mustin made the first catapult 
        launch from a ship, beginning a century of technological advancements 
        that have led to today's Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) 
        which has replaced the steam pistons with powerful magnets to launch jet 
        aircraft;
Whereas, on November 11, 1924, Lt. Dixie Kiefer made the first night catapult 
        launch from a ship, leading to today's aircraft carriers being a 
        floating city at sea with a 24-hour airport;
Whereas the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65), was 
        commissioned on November 25, 1961, ushering in a new era of the world's 
        most dominant and capable warships;
Whereas, on November 9, 2013, the first of the next generation of aircraft 
        carriers, Gerald R. Ford, was christened, marking a continuation of the 
        innovative naval aviation spirit, technological advancement, and war 
        fighting capabilities of aircraft carriers;
Whereas, on November 14, 2013, aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) 
        provided humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, food, and water to 
        the victims in the Philippines of Super Typhoon Haiyan, once again 
        demonstrating versatility of the aircraft carrier for combat, diplomatic 
        and humanitarian operations;
Whereas for over 70 years aircraft carriers have been employed in every major 
        and many smaller conflicts, including World War II, Korea, Vietnam, 
        Grenada, Lebanon, Libya, Operation Desert Storm, Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
        the fight against terrorism;
Whereas the United States Navy's aircraft carriers are a cornerstone of the 
        Nation's ability to project its power and strength;
Whereas when aircraft carriers sail the globe they are a statement of national 
        purpose and a symbol of the Nation's industrial strength, competitive 
        edge, and economic prosperity;
Whereas aircraft carriers are 4.5 acres of sovereign United States territory 
        enabling the Nation to reduce its dependency on other nations while it 
        pursues its national security interests;
Whereas aircraft carriers enable the United States Armed Forces to carry out 
        operations from international waters, avoiding the complications of 
        securing fly-over rights and land-base rights from other nations;
Whereas aircraft carriers are a modern, very mobile United States military base 
        complete with airfield, hospital, and communications systems from which 
        the United States can strike at its enemies;
Whereas over 90 percent of world trade is moved by sea, including much of the 
        world's gas and oil supply, and aircraft carriers and their strike 
        forces are constantly on patrol in vital regions of the world to keep 
        shipping lanes open and protect the interests of the United States and 
        its allies;
Whereas there are more than 2,450 companies in 48 States and over 364 
        congressional districts, and more than 13,100 shipbuilders who proudly 
        contribute to the construction and maintenance of these complex and 
        technologically advanced ships;
Whereas thousands of members of the United States Armed Forces have served the 
        Nation aboard aircraft carriers in war, peace, and times of crisis;
Whereas the Nation should formally recognize the significant contribution that 
        the aircraft carrier has made and continues to make in the Nation's 
        defense, diplomacy, and generosity around the world; and
Whereas when crisis occurs the first question that comes to everyone's lips is 
        ``Where is the nearest carrier?'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``U.S. Navy Aircraft 
        Carrier Month'' in honor of the role United States aircraft 
        carriers have held for almost 90 years serving the Nation's 
        interests in times of war and in times of peace, adapting to 
        the immediate and ever-changing nature of the world;
            (2) pledges to celebrate aircraft carrier contributions and 
        heritage in each district; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to celebrate 
        the history of aircraft carriers in the United States and to 
        always remember the vital role these vessels play in defending 
        the Nation's freedom.
