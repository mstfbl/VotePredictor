                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of October as ``National Domestic 
  Violence Awareness Month'' and expressing the sense of the House of 
  Representatives that Congress should continue to raise awareness of 
domestic violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic violence 
                         in the United States.

Whereas the month of October is observed as ``National Domestic Violence 
        Awareness Month'' across the Nation in order to increase all Americans' 
        awareness about the issue of intimate partner violence;
Whereas domestic violence can affect all people;
Whereas it is estimated that each year up to 12,000,000 people in the United 
        States are victims of intimate partner violence, including physical 
        violence, rape, and/or stalking by an intimate partner;
Whereas females are disproportionately victims, as 1 in 4 women will experience 
        intimate partner violence at some point in her life;
Whereas on average, more than 3 women are murdered by their husbands or 
        boyfriends in the United States every day;
Whereas 1 in 10 women miss school or work due to intimate partner violence;
Whereas women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates, per capita, of 
        intimate partner violence;
Whereas 25 percent of children are exposed to family violence in their lifetime;
Whereas law enforcement, service providers, and volunteers assist victims of 
        domestic violence throughout the country every day;
Whereas a 2014 National Census Survey reported that 67,646 domestic violence 
        victims were served by domestic violence shelters and programs around 
        the Nation in a single day;
Whereas an additional 10,871 people requested help that day, but due to lack of 
        resources, they were unable to be served;
Whereas domestic shelters and programs experience increased demands for service, 
        yet 28 percent report cuts in government funding, 18 percent reported 
        not enough staff, 18 percent reported cuts from private funding, and 14 
        percent reported reduced individual donations;
Whereas the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) and the Violence 
        Against Woman Act (VAWA) have changed the way our society views and 
        responds to domestic violence;
Whereas programs such as FVPSA and VAWA have led to an increase in both women 
        and men reporting domestic violence;
Whereas there is a need to continue support for programs aimed at intervening 
        and preventing domestic violence in the United States; and
Whereas individuals and organizations that are dedicated to preventing and 
        ending domestic violence should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Domestic 
        Violence Awareness Month''; and
            (2) expresses the sense of the House of Representatives 
        that Congress should continue to raise awareness of domestic 
        violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
        and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic 
        violence in the United States.
