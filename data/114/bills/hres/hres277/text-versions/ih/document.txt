                               RESOLUTION


 
     Honoring the Tunisian People for their democratic transition.

Whereas the bilateral relationship between the United States and Tunisia dates 
        back to 1795;
Whereas the United States was the first major power to recognize Tunisian 
        sovereignty following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956;
Whereas the United States and Tunisia share many core values, including respect 
        for human rights and the rule of law;
Whereas on December 17, 2010, a popular revolution began in the Tunisian city of 
        Sidi Bouzid that would inspire the ``Arab Spring'';
Whereas the people of Tunisia and their freely elected representatives work 
        diligently to secure Tunisia as a beacon for those dedicated to the rule 
        of law and democracy in a region fraught with forces that oppose such 
        goals;
Whereas Tunisia is the only Arab nation to have successfully transitioned from 
        authoritarian rule to democracy;
Whereas, on January 26, 2014, Tunisia's National Constituent Assembly adopted a 
        new constitution; and
Whereas, on December 31, 2014, Beji Caid Essebsi was sworn into office as 
        Tunisia's first freely elected President: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the people of Tunisia for their commitment to 
        democracy, the rule of law, and free and fair elections;
            (2) commends the Government of Tunisia for holding 
        successful legislative elections on October 26, 2014;
            (3) commends the Government of Tunisia for holding the 
        successful first round of their Presidential election on 
        November 23, 2014, and for the peaceful and fair completion of 
        the Presidential election on December 21, 2014;
            (4) encourages all political parties in Tunisia to continue 
        to work together as they endeavor to realize the standards of 
        transparency, inclusiveness, and equality established in the 
        Tunisian Constitution;
            (5) recognizes Tunisia's legislative and Presidential 
        elections as an example of a peaceful, democratic transition of 
        power for other nations throughout the region to follow;
            (6) affirms the United States commitment to strengthening 
        our bilateral relationship with Tunisia; and
            (7) calls on the President of the United States to advance 
        the United States-Tunisia relationship, through our shared 
        values and interests, by engaging in a Strategic Partnership.
