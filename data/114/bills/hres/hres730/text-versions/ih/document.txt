                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
 important role of the health care industry in identifying victims of 
                            sex trafficking.

Whereas sex trafficking is a form of modern slavery that exploits some of the 
        most vulnerable members of society;
Whereas sex trafficking victims face serious health risks including physical 
        injury, drug and alcohol addiction, traumatic brain injury, sexually 
        transmitted diseases, sterility, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, and 
        forced or coerced abortions;
Whereas studies show that up to 88 percent of sex trafficking victims end up in 
        the emergency setting, health clinic, or doctor's office at some point 
        during their captivity;
Whereas health care providers, especially in the emergency setting, are 
        sometimes the only outsiders that sex trafficking victims come into 
        contact with during their involuntary confinement;
Whereas health care providers in the emergency setting have limited training in 
        recognizing this at-risk patient population; and
Whereas the United States has and must continue to show strong international 
        leadership when it comes to recognizing, treating, and combating sex 
        trafficking: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly condemns any acts of sex trafficking both in 
        the United States and across the world;
            (2) recognizes that health care providers are uniquely 
        positioned to intervene on behalf of victims;
            (3) calls on the health care industry to stay informed on 
        the latest technologies and trends that occur within the sex 
        trafficking trade, including the possibility of implantable 
        devices; and
            (4) urges the front line of health care providers in the 
        emergency setting to understand the prevalence, 
        characteristics, and indicators of sex trafficking and the 
        important role they can and should play in recognizing, 
        helping, and rescuing victims of this horrendous crime.
