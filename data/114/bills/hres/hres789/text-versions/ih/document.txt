   Condemning the horrific acts of terrorism and hatred in Orlando, 
 Florida, on June 12, 2016, and expressing support and prayers for all 
                    those impacted by that tragedy.

Whereas, on June 12, 2016, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, an armed 
        gunman opened fire killing approximately 49 patrons and wounding 
        approximately 53;
Whereas this act of terrorism and hatred is the deadliest shooting massacre in 
        the history of the United States;
Whereas this attack took place at Pulse nightclub, a gathering place for members 
        of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) community, 
        indicating deep hatred and prejudice toward LGBT community members;
Whereas the assailant pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant (ISIL) in the course of his attack;
Whereas local, State, and Federal law enforcement personnel performed their 
        duties admirably in the siege and risked their lives for the safety of 
        the patrons; and
Whereas the residents of Central Florida came together to support the victims, 
        and their families, friends, and loved ones: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous 
        attack which occurred at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, 
        on June 12, 2016;
            (2) offers its condolences to the families, friends, and 
        loved ones of those who were killed at Pulse nightclub and 
        expresses its hope for the quick and complete recovery of the 
        survivors wounded in the shooting;
            (3) applauds the bravery and dedication exhibited by the 
        hundreds of local, State, and Federal law enforcement 
        officials, emergency medical responders, and the others who 
        offered their support and assistance; and
            (4) stands together united against terrorism and hatred, 
        and will not permit prejudice, violence, and fear to diminish 
        the United States ideals of compassion, liberty, and freedom.
