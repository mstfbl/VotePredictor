                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the recent violent terrorist attack against Taylor Force and 
 the recent wave of terrorism against Israel and Palestinian Authority 
       President Mahmoud Abbas' failure to condemn such attacks.

Whereas, on March 8, 2016, Mr. Taylor Force was stabbed to death by a 
        Palestinian terrorist;
Whereas Mr. Force was a graduate of West Point and served in the United States 
        Army as a Field Artillery Officer;
Whereas Mr. Force honorably served tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas Mr. Force was in Israel on a trip sponsored by Vanderbilt University at 
        which he was pursuing a Masters in Business Administration;
Whereas after the tragic and horrific murder of Mr. Force, the United States and 
        Israel condemned the terrorist who carried out the attack in the 
        strongest terms possible and without delay;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Abbas refused to condemn the terrorist 
        who murdered Mr. Force;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Abbas' Fatah Party posted a cartoon on 
        its Twitter account of a hand holding a knife over Israel and the 
        Palestinian territories with a caption calling the Palestinian terrorist 
        who murdered Mr. Force a hero and a martyr;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Abbas' and the Fatah Party's continued 
        glorification of terrorists is not conducive to establishing an 
        environment in which a peaceful resolution of the current conflict may 
        be achieved;
Whereas Mr. Force's murder by a Palestinian terrorist is yet another tragedy in 
        a sustained and growing trend of near-daily attacks by Palestinian 
        terrorists against Israeli citizens and those who visit Israel in peace 
        and friendship;
Whereas President Abbas has characterized the recent rise of violence against 
        Israelis by Palestinian terrorists as a ``justified uprising'';
Whereas President Abbas and Iran have championed payments to terrorists and 
        their families, including Iran's pledge to pay these terrorists and 
        their families $7,000 for committing acts of terrorism;
Whereas these terrorist attacks must be and are condemned in the strongest terms 
        by both the United States and Israel; and
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Abbas not only refuses to condemn the 
        terrorists who carry out these attacks, but allows his party to glorify 
        them and their heinous actions: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States--
            (1) should continue to condemn each and every act of 
        violence against Israeli citizens and those who visit Israel in 
        peace and friendship;
            (2) believes that any chance at lasting peace will only 
        occur through peaceful, bilateral discussions coupled with 
        sound counsel from peaceful allies;
            (3) expresses support for individuals and organizations 
        working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and 
        Palestinians dedicated to achieving a peaceful resolution to 
        the Israeli-Palestinian conflict;
            (4) calls on Palestinian Authority President Abbas and the 
        international community to join us in condemning the current 
        wave of terrorism in Israel; and
            (5) reaffirms the strong relationship between Israel and 
        the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
