 Recognizing the importance of trade to the United States economy and 
  the importance of completing free trade agreements with Pacific Rim 
                   countries and the European Union.

Whereas international trade is an efficient means to create private sector jobs;
Whereas 38 million American jobs are supported by international trade;
Whereas the United States economy exports $2.2 trillion in goods and services 
        each year;
Whereas the United States is currently negotiating the Trans Pacific Partnership 
        (TPP), a free trade agreement with 11 Pacific Rim countries, including 
        Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, 
        New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam;
Whereas the United States is currently negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and 
        Investment Partnership (T-TIP), a free trade agreement with 28 countries 
        of the European Union;
Whereas these trade agreements will have profoundly positive diplomatic impacts 
        that will serve to solidify United States relations with rising regional 
        economic powers; and
Whereas the United States should continue to expand its trading relationships to 
        create jobs: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
completing free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries and the 
European Union will promote economic development, create jobs, and 
solidify relations with trading partners.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
