                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the Girl Scouts of the USA on the 100th anniversary of the 
  Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in Girl Scouts, which has 
  stood for excellence and leadership for girls everywhere since 1916.

Whereas for over a century, Girl Scouts of the USA has inspired girls to lead 
        with courage, confidence, and character;
Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award represents these ideals in their highest form, 
        calling on Girl Scouts in grades 9 to 12 to take on projects that have a 
        measurable and sustainable impact on their community by first assessing 
        a need, designing a solution, completing their project, and inspiring 
        others to sustain it;
Whereas the highest award in Girl Scouting honors leadership in the Girl Scout 
        tradition;
Whereas the Girl Scout Movement began on March 12, 1912, when Juliette ``Daisy'' 
        Gordon Low, a native of Savannah, Georgia, organized a group of 18 girls 
        and provided them with the opportunity to develop physically, 
        intellectually, socially, and spiritually;
Whereas the goal of Daisy Low was to bring together girls of all backgrounds to 
        develop self-reliance and resourcefulness, and to prepare each girl for 
        a future role as a professional woman and active citizen outside the 
        home;
Whereas shortly after the inception of the Girl Scout Movement, it was decided 
        that there should be a special recognition for those girls who 
        represented the very best of Girl Scouts, girls who, through their 
        courage, tenacity, dedication, and skill, took action in their 
        communities with an impact that was at once immediate and sustainable;
Whereas 100 years ago, in 1916, the Golden Eaglet was introduced in celebration 
        of these girls, and though the name has changed over the years, from the 
        Golden Eaglet to the Curved Bar Award, to First Class, and, for the past 
        35 years, the Gold Award, the conviction, dynamism, and idealism it 
        takes to earn the highest award in Girl Scouting has not;
Whereas the Gold Award, like the girls who earn them and the projects they 
        undertake, stands as an enduring symbol of the fortitude and personal 
        strength of a Girl Scout, demonstrating clearly the tangible, real-world 
        impact that participating in Girl Scouts can have on a girl's life, and 
        by extension, her community, and our world;
Whereas comparable to an Eagle Scout, a girl who earns the Girl Scout Gold Award 
        joins an elite circle of fewer than 6 percent of Girl Scouts annually, 
        and may be eligible for advanced rank when enlisting in the United 
        States Armed Forces, or for scholarships at some universities and 
        colleges;
Whereas according to the Girl Scout Research Institute Study, ``The Power of the 
        Girl Scout Gold Award: Excellence in Leadership and Life'', Gold Award 
        recipients report a more positive sense of self, are more engaged 
        civically and in community service, have more confidence in their 
        leadership abilities, and experience greater life satisfaction and 
        success relative to their non-Gold Award peers;
Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award, acknowledges each young woman's power and 
        dedication to not only bettering herself, but to making the world a 
        better place for others;
Whereas over the course of the last century, millions of Girl Scout alumnae have 
        positively impacted their communities and the world with their creative, 
        impactful, and sustainable Take Action projects; and
Whereas with the Gold Award Centennial upon us, Girl Scouts of the USA invites 
        alumnae and supporters everywhere to ``Celebrate 100 Years of Changing 
        the World'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the remarkable impact that a century's worth 
        of Girl Scout Gold Award recipients have had on the United 
        States and the world, and the lasting impact of their projects 
        on their communities;
            (2) congratulates the Girl Scouts of the USA and Gold Award 
        recipients everywhere, on the centennial of the Girl Scout Gold 
        Award; and
            (3) joins Girl Scouts of the USA in celebrating 100 years 
        of the Gold Award.
