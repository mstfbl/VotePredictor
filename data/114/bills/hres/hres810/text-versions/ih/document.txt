                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the life 
and work of Elie Wiesel in promoting human rights, peace, and Holocaust 
                              remembrance.

Whereas Elie Wiesel was born in Sighet, Romania, on September 30, 1928, to Sarah 
        Feig and Shlomo Wiesel;
Whereas in 1944, the Wiesel family was deported to the Auschwitz concentration 
        camp in German-occupied Poland;
Whereas in 1945, Wiesel was moved to the Buchenwald concentration camp in 
        Germany, where he was eventually liberated;
Whereas Wiesel's mother and younger sister, Tzipora, died in the gas chamber at 
        Auschwitz and his father died at Buchenwald;
Whereas Wiesel and his two older sisters, Beatrice and Hilda, survived the 
        horrors of the Holocaust;
Whereas after World War II Wiesel studied in France, worked as a journalist, and 
        subsequently became a United States citizen in 1963;
Whereas Wiesel's first book ``Night'', published in 1958, told the story of his 
        family's deportation to Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust 
        and has been translated into more than 30 languages and reached millions 
        across the globe;
Whereas Wiesel would go on to author more than 60 books, plays, and essays 
        imparting much knowledge and lessons of history on his readers;
Whereas in 1978, Wiesel was appointed to chair the President's Commission on the 
        Holocaust, which was tasked with submitting a report regarding a 
        suitable means by which to remember the Holocaust and those who 
        perished;
Whereas in 1979, the Commission submitted its report and included a 
        recommendation for the creation of a Holocaust Memorial/Museum, 
        education foundation, and Committee on Conscience;
Whereas in 1980, Wiesel became the Founding Chairman of the United States 
        Holocaust Memorial Council and helped lead the effort for the United 
        States Holocaust Memorial Museum to open its doors in 1993;
Whereas in 1986, Wiesel and his wife, Marion, created The Elie Wiesel Foundation 
        for Humanity in order to fight indifference, intolerance, and injustice;
Whereas Wiesel, dedicated to teaching, served as a Visiting Scholar at Yale 
        University from 1972 to 1976, professor at the City University of New 
        York from 1972 to 1976, and Boston University from 1976 until his 
        passing;
Whereas Wiesel has received several awards for his work to promote human rights, 
        peace, and Holocaust remembrance, including the Nobel Peace Prize, 
        Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States Congressional Gold 
        Medal, the National Humanities Medal, the Medal of Liberty, the rank of 
        Grand-Croix in the French Legion of Honor, and the United States 
        Holocaust Memorial Museum Award; and
Whereas, on July 2, 2016, at the age of 87, Elie Wiesel passed away, leaving 
        behind a legacy of ensuring a voice for the voiceless, promotion of 
        peace and tolerance, and combating indifference, intolerance, and 
        genocide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the life, work, and legacy of Elie Wiesel;
            (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the members of Elie 
        Wiesel's family; and
            (3) reaffirms Elie Wiesel's efforts to preserve the memory 
        of those who perished and prevent the recurrence of another 
        Holocaust, to combat hate and intolerance in any manifestation, 
        and to never forget and also learn from the lessons of history.
