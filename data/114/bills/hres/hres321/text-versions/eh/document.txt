H. Res. 321

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         June 18, 2015.
    Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take 
from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 2146) to amend the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic 
controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 
50, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider 
in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by 
the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means or his designee that the House 
concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment printed in the report of the 
Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate amendment and the 
motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion or demand for 
division of the question.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
