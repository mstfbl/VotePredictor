    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the entering into of an agreement or compact by 2 or more States, for 
cooperative effort and mutual assistance, would be beneficial to the 
development of an Interstate 73 corridor. Such an agreement may 
incorporate the following elements to the extent that such elements are 
consistent with Federal law and specifically section 1105(c)(5) of the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991:
            (1) Study, development, and promotion of a plan for the 
        design, construction, financing, and operation of the 
        Interstate 73 corridor through the States of South Carolina, 
        North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan.
            (2) Coordination of efforts to establish a common legal 
        framework in all the signatory States to authorize and 
        facilitate design, construction, financing, and operation of 
        the Interstate 73 corridor or through public-private 
        partnerships.
            (3) Advocacy for Federal funding to support the 
        establishment of the Interstate 73 corridor.
            (4) Making available to the Interstate 73 corridor project 
        funding and resources that are or may be appropriated by the 
        signatory States and allocated for that purpose.
            (5) Doing all things necessary or convenient to facilitate 
        and coordinate the design, construction, financing, and 
        operation of the Interstate 73 corridor to the extent that such 
        plans and programs are consistent with Federal law and the laws 
        of the signatory States.
