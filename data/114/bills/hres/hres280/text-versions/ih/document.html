                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the House music genre and its ``Godfather'', the late Frankie 
     Knuckles of Chicago, Illinois, for valuable and longstanding 
           contributions to the culture of the United States.

Whereas Frankie Knuckles was a world-class entertainer who revolutionized dance 
        music around the globe;
Whereas Frankie Knuckles played a pivotal role in the creation and evolution of 
        the House music genre, which has become a staple of dance clubs 
        throughout the world;
Whereas, for over 30 years, Frankie Knuckles packed the world's dance floors 
        with his unique musical style;
Whereas one of Frankie Knuckles' first albums included ``The Whistle Song'' 
        which is perhaps most memorable as the soundtrack for a Lipton iced tea 
        commercial in the mid-1990s;
Whereas, as a producer and remixer, Frankie Knuckles lent his talents to some of 
        R&B and pop music's elite, including artists such as Mary J. Blige, the 
        Pet Shop Boys, Ricky Martin, Lisa Stansfield, Yoko Ono, Whitney Houston, 
        Sounds of Blackness, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Diana Ross, Luther 
        Vandross, Michael Bolton, Toni Braxton, and Madonna;
Whereas Frankie Knuckles' production and mixing career was officially recognized 
        by the music industry in 1998 when The National Academy of Recording 
        Arts and Sciences presented him with the first ever Grammy for ``Remixer 
        of the Year, Non-Classical'';
Whereas, in 2001, Definity Records released the single ``Keep on Movin'' by 
        Frankie Knuckles featuring vocalist Nicki Richards;
Whereas the song ``Keep on Movin'' opened Frankie Knuckles' mix album 
        ``Motivation'' and was the beginning of a collaboration between Frankie 
        Knuckles and Nicki Richards that culminated with the release of his 
        album ``A New Reality'' about which Billboard Magazine wrote ``Knuckles 
        strings together an inspirational and spiritual collection of gospel-
        infused club songs'';
Whereas ``A New Reality'' was released in April 2004 in the United States, 
        United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and Japan simultaneously, and 
        continues to receive media attention, and the album's first single ``Bac 
        N da Day'', was Frankie Knuckles' first collaboration in 20 years with 
        longtime friend, House music legend, and co-writer Jamie Principle;
Whereas, on August 25, 2004, the Mayor of Chicago proclaimed the date ``Frankie 
        Knuckles Day'' and designated a street ``Frankie Knuckles Way'';
Whereas Frankie Knuckles served as a Governor and Trustee for the New York City 
        Chapter of The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences;
Whereas Frankie Knuckles continued to use his celebrity to provide entertainment 
        for numerous charities, and has lent his services to many organizations, 
        including Meals on Wheels, Gay Men's Health Crisis, the Pediatric AIDS 
        foundation, and the Harvey Milk School;
Whereas Frankie Knuckles established the Warehouse nightclub at 206 South 
        Jefferson in 1977 providing a transitioning portal for the Disco dance 
        music genre and a music rebirth extracted from the name this extremely 
        popular venue henceforth and forevermore designated as ``House Music'';
Whereas Frankie served as an inspiration to a legion of DJs worldwide including 
        Chicago DJs Wayne Williams, The Chosen Few, Farley Keith Williams aka 
        Farley Jackmaster Funk and the Hotmix 5, Jesse Saunders, Steve Silk 
        Hurley, Jamie Principal, Andre Hatchett, Marshall Jefferson, Chip E, and 
        many others as pioneering disciples of a new and emerging genre who 
        helped to take House music to international acclaim;
Whereas Frankie Knuckles is an American music icon, inspiration to many, and a 
        global music phenomenon; and
Whereas we support the designation of July 2015 as ``House Music Heritage 
        Month'' honoring the contributions of the House music genre and its 
        ``Godfather'', Frankie Knuckles, for their valuable and longstanding 
        contributions to the culture of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) applauds the contributions made by the House music 
        genre and artists such as Frankie Knuckles to the culture of 
        the United States;
            (2) supports the designation of a national day of 
        recognition for Chicago House music pioneer Frankie Knuckles;
            (3) recommits itself to ensuring that musical artists such 
        as Frankie Knuckles receive fair protection under the copyright 
        laws of the United States;
            (4) endeavors to support the protection of House music 
        artists' content globally; and
            (5) directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to 
        transmit enrolled copies of this resolution to Frankie 
        Knuckles, or his assignee.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
