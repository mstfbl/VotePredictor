                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             April 28, 2015

Johnson of Ohio) submitted the following resolution; which was referred 
                  to the Committee on Foreign Affairs

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should come from direct 
 bilateral negotiations without preconditions and without interference 
                        from the United Nations.

Whereas it has been longstanding policy of the United States under both 
        Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses that a durable 
        resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be achieved only 
        through direct negotiations between two parties without preconditions;
Whereas it has been longstanding policy of the United States under both 
        Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses to promote a 
        resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through direct 
        negotiations between the two parties;
Whereas both Democratic and Republican-led Congresses have long appropriated 
        funds to promote a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
        through direct negotiations between the two parties;
Whereas it has been the longstanding policy of the United States under both 
        Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses that a United 
        Nations mandate to force a final status agreement to the Israeli-
        Palestinian peace process is harmful and not appropriate; and
Whereas this Congress would view any support by the United States Government for 
        a United Nations effort to dictate conditions, details, or timelines for 
        negotiations and a resolution between Israel and the Palestinian 
        Authority as a violation of long-standing and sound United States 
        policy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the United States House of 
Representatives that a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
should come from direct bilateral negotiations without preconditions 
and without interference from the United Nations.
                                 <all>
