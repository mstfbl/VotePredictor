                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            February 4, 2016

Mr. Ross submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the

                               RESOLUTION


 
            Condemning and censuring President Barack Obama.

Whereas President Barack Obama continues to operate outside of the rule of law 
        and the authority granted to him by the Constitution of the United 
        States;
Whereas President Barack Obama is circumventing the intent of Congress and the 
        bipartisan Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel 
        Prevention Act of 2015 that was explicitly designed to protect our 
        country and citizens from radical Islamic terrorism, and which he signed 
        into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016; and
Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 passed in the House of 
        Representatives with a bipartisan vote of 316-113: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives does hereby condemn and 
censure President Barack Obama.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
