                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commending the Tennessee Valley Authority on the 80th anniversary of 
         the unified development of the Tennessee River system.

Whereas the Tennessee Valley Authority (in this preamble referred to as the 
        ``TVA'') was created by Congress in 1933 to improve navigation along the 
        Tennessee River, reduce the risk of floods and flood damage, provide 
        low-cost electricity, and promote environmental stewardship and economic 
        development in the region;
Whereas the TVA submitted a plan to Congress in March of 1936 to improve 
        navigation of the Tennessee River and to help control flooding in the 
        Tennessee Valley;
Whereas Norris Dam, the first dam constructed by the TVA, began to operate on 
        July 28, 1936;
Whereas the integrated management of the Tennessee River system by the TVA 
        provides a wide range of benefits that include electrical power, 
        reducing floods, improving water quality and supply, enhancing 
        recreation, and protecting public land;
Whereas the TVA has improved navigation of the Tennessee River system and 
        facilitated freight transportation;
Whereas the TVA has reduced the risk of flood damage through the construction of 
        locks, dams, and reservoirs throughout the Tennessee Valley;
Whereas the TVA provides reliable and affordable electricity and has stimulated 
        economic growth;
Whereas the TVA continues to promote economic development by helping companies 
        and communities attract investments that bring good jobs to the 
        Tennessee Valley region; and
Whereas the TVA continues to serve more than 9,000,000 customers in Alabama, 
        Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the Tennessee Valley Authority on the 80th 
        anniversary of the unified development of the Tennessee River 
        system;
            (2) recognizes the important role of Norris Dam, the first 
        dam constructed by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which was 
        completed on July 28, 1936;
            (3) honors the accomplishments of the Tennessee Valley 
        Authority in improving navigation, controlling floods, 
        promoting environmental stewardship, and providing affordable 
        electricity throughout the Tennessee Valley region;
            (4) recognizes the Tennessee Valley Authority for its long 
        and proud history of service in the areas of energy, the 
        environment, and economic development throughout Alabama, 
        Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, and 
        Virginia; and
            (5) respectfully requests the Clerk of the House of 
        Representatives to transmit a copy of this resolution for 
        appropriate display to--
                    (A) the Chairman of the Board of the Tennessee 
                Valley Authority, Joe Ritch; and
                    (B) the Chief Executive Officer of the Tennessee 
                Valley Authority, William Johnson.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
