                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding 
  preserving the rights of employers and employees regarding coverage 
                   through association health plans.

Whereas for decades association health plans have provided employers and 
        employees with access to high-quality, affordable coverage;
Whereas this coverage should be preserved as it meets the goal of ensuring 
        access to quality, affordable health care; and
Whereas the Affordable Care Act should not be interpreted by the Federal 
        Government and State governments in a way that destroys health insurance 
        markets: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Federal Government and State governments should 
        carry out the law in a way that preserves the rights of 
        employers and employees to maintain health insurance coverage 
        through association health plans; and
            (2) the Affordable Care Act should not be construed to 
        supersede State law that establishes, implements, or continues 
        in effect any standard or requirement solely relating to health 
        insurance issuers in connection with association health plans 
        except to the extent that such standard or requirement prevents 
        the application of an explicit requirement of Federal law.
                                 <all>
