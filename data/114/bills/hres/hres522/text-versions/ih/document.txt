                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of November 1 through November 7, 2015, as 
                   ``National Apprenticeship Week''.

Whereas there are more than 445,000 active apprenticeships throughout the United 
        States;
Whereas an apprentice earns an average starting annual salary of over $50,000, 
        and can earn $300,000 more over the course of his or her career than 
        someone who does not serve as an apprentice;
Whereas for every $1 spent on apprenticeships, employers receive $1.47 back in 
        increased productivity;
Whereas apprenticeships provide the training and skills needed to meet the 
        demands of a 21st-century economy;
Whereas the Department of Labor recently awarded $175 million in American 
        Apprenticeship Grants to 46 recipients;
Whereas apprenticeships offer employers the opportunity to build a continuous 
        stream of talent in-house, instead of looking outside to hire new 
        workers; and
Whereas more than 150,000 employers and labor management organizations 
        participate in registered apprenticeship programs: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Apprenticeship 
        Week'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of apprenticeships in 
        developing a well-trained and highly-skilled workforce; and
            (3) commends organizations and employers that actively 
        support apprenticeship programs.
                                 <all>
