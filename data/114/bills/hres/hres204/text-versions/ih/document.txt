                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of May 13, 2015, as a national day 
    of celebration of the diversity in the United States, known as 
                      Diversity Day in the Nation.

Whereas since its foundation, the United States has been a country of 
        extraordinary ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity;
Whereas the United States has historically served as a beacon of light and hope 
        for persecuted populations and immigrants from around the world 
        searching for a better life, and has welcomed the cultural contributions 
        of these communities upon their arrival;
Whereas while each successive wave of immigrants has over time contributed 
        immensely to the United States identity, many immigrants have endured 
        against opposition that attempted to restrict their presence and 
        contributions;
Whereas through the civil rights movement, women's suffrage movement, the 
        marriage equality movement, and countless other movements, the United 
        States has continuously struggled and succeeded to achieve greater 
        acceptance and awareness of the value of diversity;
Whereas myriad cultures and communities have contributed to the fabric of 
        society, and the diversity in the United States continues to grow, with 
        substantial increases in Hispanic and Asian populations in the nascent 
        years of the 21st century; and
Whereas May 13, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as a national 
        day of celebration of the diversity of culture in the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a national day of 
        celebration for the diversity of the United States; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to promote 
        cultural awareness, combat polarization and stereotypes, and 
        improve community understanding and cooperation among people 
        from different cultures.
                                 <all>
