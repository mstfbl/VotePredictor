                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commemorating the inaugural ``International Yoga Day'' on June 21.

Whereas the United Nations adopted the resolution on ``Yoga Day'' (A/ReS/69/131) 
        on December 11, 2014, which proclaimed that June 21 is the 
        ``International Day of Yoga'';
Whereas the practicing of yoga will help promote better health among the global 
        population and help encourage the need for healthier choices and 
        lifestyles; and
Whereas Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi addressed the United Nations 
        General Assembly on September 27, 2014, on the adoption of an 
        International Yoga Day, stating, ``Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's 
        ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and 
        action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a 
        holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but 
        to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the 
        nature.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the inaugural ``International Yoga Day'';
            (2) supports the ideals that ``International Yoga Day'' 
        represents; and
            (3) encourages all individuals to participate in 
        ``International Yoga Day''.
                                 <all>
