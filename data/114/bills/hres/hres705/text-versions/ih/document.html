                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of June as ``National Men's Cancer 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas 1 in 2 men will be diagnosed with cancer over the course of their 
        lifetimes;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
        cancer claims the lives of nearly 300,000 men annually in the United 
        States;
Whereas the CDC also reports that the incidence of cancer for men varies by race 
        and ethnicity, with minority men having the highest cancer incidence and 
        mortality rates;
Whereas statistics show that a higher percentage of men will die from cancer 
        than women because they are typically diagnosed at a later stage;
Whereas despite advances in medical technology and research, men continue to 
        live an average of 5 fewer years compared to their female counterparts;
Whereas ``National Men's Health Week'', which is annually celebrated as the week 
        leading up to, and including Father's Day, was established in 1994 by 
        the United States Congress, to show how simple diagnostic and screening 
        tests can save lives;
Whereas promoting awareness and education about men's cancer is crucial to 
        improving the health and well-being of men across the Nation, 
        facilitating early detection, improving the prognoses of men who have 
        been diagnosed with the disease, and ultimately preventing further loss 
        of life; and
Whereas June would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National Men's 
        Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Men's Cancer Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) encourages the Federal Government, States, localities, 
        and nonprofit organizations to observe the month with 
        appropriate awareness programs and educational activities, with 
        the goal of increasing public knowledge of cancers 
        disproportionately affecting men;
            (3) recognizes the profound toll a diagnosis of cancer has 
        on men, families, and communities and pledges to make its 
        prevention and cure a public health priority; and
            (4) urges public and private sector efforts to promote 
        awareness, invest in research, and improve treatments for men's 
        cancers.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
