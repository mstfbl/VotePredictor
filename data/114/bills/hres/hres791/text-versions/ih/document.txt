                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the recognition of 2016 as the ``Year of Pulse Crops'' and 
  acknowledging the nutritional benefit and important contribution to 
                      soil health of pulse crops.

Whereas the United States will celebrate 2016 as the ``Year of Pulse Crops'';
Whereas the 68th United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 as the 
        International Year of Pulses;
Whereas a pulse crop is a dry, edible seed of a plant in the legume family, 
        including a dry bean, dry pea, lentil, or chickpea;
Whereas pulse crops are grown in abundance in Arizona, California, Colorado, 
        Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North 
        Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming;
Whereas pulse crops are an important component of a nutritious diet and are high 
        in plant-based protein, vitamins, fiber, and minerals, including iron, 
        potassium, magnesium, and zinc;
Whereas pulse crops help prevent serious and chronic illness, including heart 
        disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke;
Whereas legumes serve as an important rotation crop, keep soil fertile, and 
        improve overall soil health by replenishing nitrogen;
Whereas pulse crops provide food security and nutrition to much of the 
        developing world as low-cost sources of protein; and
Whereas pulse crops are important economic development crops for small farmers, 
        for both domestic production and export potential: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports--
            (1) the recognition of the ``Year of Pulse Crops'';
            (2) the participation by representatives of the Federal 
        Government in events and activities organized pursuant to the 
        observance by the United Nations of the International Year of 
        Pulses; and
            (3) the future funding of programs to support the 
        cultivation and consumption of pulse crops.
                                 <all>
