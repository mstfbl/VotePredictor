    That--
            (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
                    (A) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer 
                (LGBTQ) rights are human rights to be recognized and 
                protected by the United States Constitution; and
                    (B) the United States should continue to strive to 
                ensure that the promise of equality is realized for all 
                people in the United States; and
            (2) the House of Representatives--
                    (A) recognizes that all people in the United States 
                should be treated fairly and equally regardless of 
                sexual orientation or gender identity;
                    (B) acknowledges the struggle of the Stonewall 
                protestors and countless other LGBTQ people for 
                equality; and
                    (C) encourages the celebration of LGBTQ Pride Month 
                to provide a continuing opportunity for all people in 
                the United States to learn about the discrimination and 
                inequality that has faced, and continues to face, LGBTQ 
                people.
