                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the American 
                        Federation of Teachers.

Whereas May 9, 2016, is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the American 
        Federation of Teachers (referred to in this preamble as the ``AFT'');
Whereas the AFT was founded in Chicago on May 9, 1916, when 8 local unions 
        formed the AFT and were granted a charter signed by the AFL President, 
        Samuel Gompers;
Whereas those 8 local unions were--

    (1) the Chicago Teachers Federation;

    (2) the Chicago Federation of Men Teachers;

    (3) the Chicago Federation of Women High School Teachers;

    (4) the Gary, Indiana, Teachers Federation;

    (5) the Teachers Union of New York;

    (6) the Oklahoma Teachers Federation;

    (7) the Scranton, Pennsylvania, Teachers Association; and

    (8) the High School Teachers Union of Washington, DC;

Whereas, during the first century of the AFT, the AFT has grown mightily into a 
        diverse union of professionals that champions principles of fairness, 
        democracy, economic opportunity, and high-quality public education, 
        healthcare, and public services for students, the families of the 
        students, and communities;
Whereas the AFT advances those principles through community engagement, 
        organizing, collective bargaining, political activism, and the daily 
        work of members of the AFT in the communities the members serve; and
Whereas members of the AFT and affiliates of the AFT have played a crucial role 
        in major milestones such as the civil rights movement, education reform, 
        women's rights, and the evolution of the middle class: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the 100th anniversary of the founding of 
        the American Federation of Teachers; and
            (2) expresses hope that the American Federation of Teachers 
        will honor its proud past by meeting the challenges of the 
        future with the same level of commitment to the goals, ideals, 
        and principles it championed during the first century of the 
        American Federation of Teachers.
                                 <all>
