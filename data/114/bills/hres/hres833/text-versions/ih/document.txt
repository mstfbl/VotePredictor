                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recommending the designation of the first Wednesday of December as 
                  ``Government Customer Service Day''.

Whereas the business of Government is the business of customer service;
Whereas polls show the majority of citizens have a negative view of Government;
Whereas polls show the majority of citizens believe the Federal Government can 
        improve customer service;
Whereas polls show that quality service delivery increases citizen trust in 
        Government;
Whereas the Government owes taxpayers effective, efficient, and responsible 
        government;
Whereas the GPRA Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-352) resulted in a cross-agency 
        priority goal of delivering world-class customer service to citizens by 
        making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete 
        transactions and have a positive experience with the Government;
Whereas the GPRA Act of 2010 resulted in President Obama issuing an executive 
        order in 2011 to improve the quality of Government service to the 
        public;
Whereas there are an untold number of hard working and dedicated Federal 
        employees who are delivering exceptional customer service every day 
        without getting the recognition they deserve; and
Whereas the first Wednesday of December should be designated as ``Government 
        Customer Service Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) encourages the executive branch to find innovative ways 
        to instill a culture of customer centered service; and
            (2) encourages each agency to recognize employees who 
        deliver outstanding levels of service to the public.
                                 <all>
