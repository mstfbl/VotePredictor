Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the need 
        to eliminate partisan redistricting and gerrymandering.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. ELIMINATING PARTISAN REDISTRICTING AND GERRYMANDERING.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) Congress should establish a Federal reapportionment 
        system that would create compact and contiguous congressional 
        districts that, to the greatest extent possible, follow 
        geographic boundaries and county lines;
            (2) congressional districts should not favor or disfavor an 
        incumbent or political party;
            (3) congressional districts should adhere to the existing 
        standards of equal population; and
            (4) the highest court of each State should have the power 
        to reject congressional district maps that do not meet the 
        above criteria.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
