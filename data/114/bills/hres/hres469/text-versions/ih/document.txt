                               RESOLUTION


 
 Urging North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries to 
  meet or exceed the two percent gross domestic product commitment to 
                          spending on defense.

Whereas in 2006, the defense ministers of North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO) Alliance member countries agreed to commit a minimum of two 
        percent, as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) to spending on 
        defense;
Whereas in 2006, the defense ministers of NATO Alliance member countries further 
        agreed to commit a minimum of 20 percent of defense expenditures to 
        major equipment spending;
Whereas these commitments were reaffirmed in the Wales Summit Declaration of 
        2014 issued by Heads of State and Government participating in the 
        meeting of the North Atlantic Council;
Whereas Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that, ``in order more 
        effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties, 
        separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective self-help 
        and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and 
        collective capacity to resist armed attack.'';
Whereas member nations that meet or exceed the GDP commitment and member nations 
        with a plan of action to move toward the GDP commitment are commended 
        and encouraged;
Whereas the aggressive actions of Russia against Ukraine challenge global 
        freedom, security, and stability critical to the NATO Alliance;
Whereas the instability in the Middle East and North Africa and the continued 
        threat of global terrorism pose a threat to security and prosperity;
Whereas emerging security challenges such as cyber-attacks threaten the 
        resilience and integrity of NATO networks and infrastructure assets; and
Whereas the resolute commitment of the United States to NATO is steadfast and 
        the efforts of member nations that have met GDP commitments is 
        applauded: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls on North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        member countries to meet or exceed the two percent gross 
        domestic product commitment to spending on defense;
            (2) calls on NATO member countries to meet or exceed the 
        20-percent commitment to defense expenditures on major 
        equipment spending; and
            (3) reaffirms the United States longstanding and resolute 
        commitment to NATO and the peace through strength it advances.
                                 <all>
