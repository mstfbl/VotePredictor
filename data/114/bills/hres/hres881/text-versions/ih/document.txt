Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs were conceived of to ``promote international

        in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful relations 
        between the United States and the other countries of the world'';
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs are administered by the International and 
        Foreign Language Education Office of the U.S. Department of Education;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs promote the Nation's security and global 
        economic competitiveness and help educators to prepare students for 
        college completion and career readiness as well as to thrive in the 
        Nation's diverse communities through the development of expertise in 
        foreign languages and area and international studies;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs provide approximately 75 grants annually to 
        institutions of higher education and other administering agencies, 
        including community colleges and minority-serving institutions, 
        supporting over 500 elementary and secondary school teachers and higher 
        education faculty and students in all regions of the world;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs help train the next generation of educators 
        on global issues and world languages to help ensure our students from 
        all backgrounds are more prepared for the challenges of the 21st 
        century;
Whereas Fulbright-Hays participants engage in immersive learning opportunities 
        abroad to enhance their teaching and research here at home;
Whereas Fulbright-Hays participants take part in research, curriculum 
        development, and in-depth studies abroad about critical issues of our 
        time, developing and utilizing proficiency in world languages;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad program, the 
        Fulbright-Hays Seminars Abroad program, and the Fulbright-Hays Group 
        Projects Abroad program have supported over 15,000 elementary, 
        secondary, and postsecondary educators and administrators with immersive 
        international experiences to better understand global challenges, and 
        develop experts in world areas and languages;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs have built critical capacity in our schools, 
        colleges, and universities and participating educators have returned to 
        impact thousands of students across the Nation;
Whereas the Fulbright-Hays Programs support the teaching and learning of 78 Less 
        Commonly Taught Languages, all of which are being taught at the advanced

        students, teachers, faculty, and school administrators to develop

        Fulbright-Hays Programs;
            (2) congratulates all recipients of Fulbright-Hays awards, 
        both past and present; and
            (3) calls on elementary, secondary and postsecondary
