                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
 vital role the Civil Air Patrol has played, and continues to play, in 
  supporting the homeland security and national defense of the United 
                                States.

Whereas, on December 1, 1941, a new civil defense organization known as the 
        Civil Air Patrol was founded, which was to rely on volunteer civilian 
        aviators who would fly in support of the homeland security of the United 
        States;
Whereas with the attack on Pearl Harbor six days later and the United States 
        entry into World War II, the Civil Air Patrol would find itself serving 
        the Nation in ways that were not imagined at the time of its conception;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol initially engaged in coastal patrol operations that 
        were deemed critical to the United States war effort, piloting aircraft 
        that in total flew 24 million miles over 18 months, reported 173 
        possible enemy submarines, and dropped 82 bombs or depth charges;
Whereas Civil Air Patrol civilian volunteers flew privately owned light aircraft 
        armed with military bombs at their own expense, often at low altitude, 
        in bad weather, and 60 miles or more from shore;
Whereas Civil Air Patrol volunteers undertook other vital World War II missions 
        nationwide, which included border patrols, search and rescue operations, 
        courier and cargo services, and air defense and pilot training;
Whereas, unlike many organizations at the time, the Civil Air Patrol welcomed 
        women into its ranks to fly, with over half of the women later joining 
        the Women's Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) after having first flown with 
        the Civil Air Patrol;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol was open to all interested pilots, which allowed 
        African-Americans an opportunity to serve and fly for their Nation well 
        before the adoption of an integrated Armed Forces;
Whereas today the Civil Air Patrol continues its critical mission in service to 
        the United States, now as a vital partner for the Air Force, serving as 
        its auxiliary force and, since 2015, as an official component of its 
        total force;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol remains one of the Nation's premier inland search 
        and rescue organizations, and was credited with saving 69 lives through 
        search and rescue operations in 2015;
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol continues to fulfill many other vital missions, 
        including helping to train interceptor pilots and unmanned aerial 
        vehicle operators under realistic conditions, aerial observation 
        missions, counterdrug operations, disaster relief support, live organ 
        transport, aerospace education, cadet programs, and Reserve Officer 
        Training Corps orientation flights;
Whereas the continued work of the Civil Air Patrol's all-volunteer force offers 
        vital support to homeland security and defense missions; and
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol's weekly youth and aerospace education programs 
        continue to introduce young students to the field of aviation and 
        instill within them the values of national service and personal 
        responsibility: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) applauds the Civil Air Patrol for 75 years of 
        continuous service in times of peace and war;
            (2) recognizes the critical emergency services, training 
        support, and mission capabilities that the Civil Air Patrol 
        offers State and national homeland security agencies as well as 
        the United States Armed Forces; and
            (3) commends the Civil Air Patrol's more than 23,500 youth 
        and 32,500 adult volunteers who hail from a range of 
        professions across the country and dedicate their time to the 
        service of their communities and the United States.
                                 <all>
