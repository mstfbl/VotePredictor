Whereas ISIS terrorists killed 44 people and wounded 239 in an attack at the 
        airport in Istanbul, Turkey, on June 28, 2016;
Whereas ISIS continues to disseminate propaganda and inspire additional 
        terrorist attacks against North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        member states;
Whereas the radical, hate-filled, and odious ideology of ISIS opposes the 
        fundamental values and guiding principles of the NATO alliance and its 
        member states;

        NATO member states; and

        NATO alliance: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), 
        its ideology, its past attacks, and its ongoing campaign of 
        atrocities in the strongest possible terms;
            (2) calls upon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO) to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and 
        declare that the ISIS attacks against France, Belgium, the 
        United States, and Turkey represent attacks against all NATO 
        members;
            (3) urges NATO to organize and conduct a military campaign 
        against ISIS with the objective of the destruction of the 
        terrorist organization;

        operations against ISIS in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere as 
        needed;

        sharing between NATO members with the goal of improving 
        counterterrorism capabilities and operations;
            (6) requests that NATO increase coordination and 
        information sharing with the European Union;
            (7) urges NATO to reassess its counterterrorism strategy in 
        order to more effectively address the threat from ISIS; and
            (8) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to 
        supporting the NATO alliance and destroying ISIS.
