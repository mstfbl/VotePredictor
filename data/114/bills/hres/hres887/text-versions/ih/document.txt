                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting efforts to increase competition and accountability in the 
   health insurance marketplace, and to extend accessible, quality, 
affordable health care coverage to every American through the choice of 
                        a public insurance plan.

Whereas under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-
        148; 124 Stat. 119) (referred to in this preamble as the ``Affordable 
        Care Act''), 20,000,000 Americans have gained health insurance coverage, 
        including 11,000,000 Americans that have coverage through the public 
        exchanges created by that Act;
Whereas the uninsured rate is at its lowest point in history, but there is more 
        work to be done to provide access to coverage for Americans that remain 
        uninsured, and to reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for the 
        31,000,000 Americans who are currently underinsured;
Whereas before the date of enactment of the Affordable Care Act, millions of 
        individuals with preexisting conditions were denied health coverage by 
        insurance companies that controlled who received health care in the 
        United States;
Whereas profound disparities persist in health outcomes based on race, 
        ethnicity, and geography, and nearly 4,000,000 adults, 
        disproportionately people of color, lack coverage as a result of the 
        failure of 19 States to expand the Medicaid program under title XIX of 
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) under the Affordable 
        Care Act;
Whereas public insurance options for workers' compensation insurance have 
        resulted in lower rates for small businesses and more competition in 
        several States;
Whereas giving all Americans the choice of a public, nonprofit health insurance 
        option would--

    (1) lead to increased competition and reduced premiums;

    (2) cut wasteful spending on administration, marketing, and executive 
pay; and

    (3) ensure that consumers have the affordable choices they deserve;

Whereas public programs such as the Medicare program under title XVIII of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) often deliver care more 
        cost-effectively by limiting administrative overhead and securing better 
        prices from providers; and
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office has found that a public health insurance 
        option would save taxpayers billions of dollars: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports efforts to 
build on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
111-148; 124 Stat. 119) by ensuring that, in addition to the health 
coverage options provided by private insurers, every American has 
access to a public health insurance option, which, when established, 
will--
            (1) strengthen competition;
            (2) improve affordability for families by reducing premiums 
        and increasing choices; and
            (3) save American taxpayers billions of dollars.
