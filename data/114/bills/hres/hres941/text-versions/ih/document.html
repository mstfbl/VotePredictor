                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            December 5, 2016

  Mr. Cardenas (for himself and Ms. Lofgren) submitted the following 
 resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of February 22, 2017, as 
    ``National Heart Valve Disease Awareness Day'', coinciding with 
                         American Heart Month.

Whereas more than 5,000,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with 
        heart valve disease, which involves damage to one or more of the heart's 
        valves and can reduce blood flow, causing the heart to work harder and 
        the body to get less oxygen;
Whereas more than 22,000 people in the United States die from heart valve 
        disease every year;
Whereas more than 1 in 8 people age 75 and older are estimated to have moderate 
        to severe valve disease;
Whereas 1 in 10 women age 75 and older are estimated to have valve disease;
Whereas if not treated, some forms of heart valve disease can lead to major 
        health problems including: decreased mobility, disability, loss of 
        independence, heart failure, stroke, blood clotting, or even death;
Whereas when aortic stenosis, a common form of valve disease, becomes severe, 
        the average survival rate without surgical intervention is as low as 50 
        percent at 2 years after the onset of symptoms and 20 percent at 5 
        years;
Whereas symptoms of heart valve disease such as shortness of breath, excessive 
        fatigue, and fainting are often dismissed as normal aspects of aging;
Whereas people are at higher risk of developing heart valve disease if they have 
        high blood pressure, high cholesterol, insulin resistance, diabetes, 
        coronary heart disease, a congenital heart abnormality or family history 
        of valve disease, a history of heart problems like heart attack or heart 
        failure, rheumatic fever or infective endocarditis, or previous valve 
        disease;
Whereas people are also at higher risk of developing heart valve disease if they 
        are a smoker, overweight or obese, or older in age;
Whereas heart valve disease, with proper education and awareness, can often be 
        detected through a simple physical exam and treated with either valve 
        repair or valve replacement;
Whereas lifestyle changes and medication may relieve many symptoms and 
        complications of valve disease;
Whereas the survival rate for valve surgery is approximately 97 percent, and in 
        most cases patients are relieved of symptoms and enjoy a longer life; 
        and
Whereas the designation of February 22, 2017, as ``National Heart Valve Disease 
        Awareness Day'', and coinciding with American Heart Month, will raise 
        public awareness about the specific risks of heart valve disease and 
        ensure patients receive a timely diagnosis and proper treatment: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports--
                    (A) the designation of ``National Heart Valve 
                Disease Awareness Day''; and
                    (B) the efforts of the Secretary of Health and 
                Human Services, as well as the entire medical 
                community, to educate people about the risks, symptoms, 
                and treatment of heart valve disease; and
            (2) respectfully requests that the Clerk of the House of 
        Representatives transmit a copy of this resolution to the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
