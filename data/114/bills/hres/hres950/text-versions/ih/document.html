                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of October 23 as a national day 
   of remembrance of the tragic 1983 terrorist bombing of the United 
            States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.

Whereas the United States deployed members of the Armed Forces to Lebanon in 
        1982 as part of a multinational peacekeeping force;
Whereas early on the morning of October 23, 1983, a truck packed with explosives 
        detonated outside of a building at Beirut International Airport that 
        served as quarters for several hundred members of the United States 
        Armed Forces deployed as part of the peacekeeping force;
Whereas 241 members of the Armed Forces were killed in the blast;
Whereas the Americans killed included 220 Marines, members of the 1st Battalion, 
        8th Marines-Battalion Landing Team, which made October 23, 1983, the 
        deadliest day for the Marine Corps since the Battle of Iwo Jima in 
        February 1945 during World War II;
Whereas, in addition to the Marine Corps casualties, 18 Navy sailors and three 
        Army soldiers were killed, and more than 100 other members of the Armed 
        Forces were injured;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces from 39 States and Puerto Rico died while 
        serving in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 1984;
Whereas, on the same day as the bombing of the Marine Corps Barracks, another 
        suicide bomber killed 58 French paratroopers housed at another building 
        in Beirut; and
Whereas it is fitting and proper that the events of October 23, 1983, and the 
        members of the United States Armed Forces who died in Beirut on that day 
        are recognized through the establishment of a national remembrance day 
        on October 23: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a national day of 
        remembrance for members of the United States Armed Forces who 
        were killed or injured by the terrorist attack on the United 
        States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 
        1983; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
        and participate in appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other 
        activities in observance of such a national day of remembrance.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
