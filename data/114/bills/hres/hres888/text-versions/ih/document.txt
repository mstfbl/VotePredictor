                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of September as ``National Childhood 
                       Obesity Awareness Month''.

Whereas childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in 
        adolescents in the past 30 years;
Whereas 17 percent or 12,700,000 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years are 
        obese;
Whereas childhood obesity is more prevalent among children from low-income 
        families, for example 14.5 percent of preschool children living below 
        the poverty threshold are obese;
Whereas significant disparities exist among the obesity rates of children based 
        on race, for example on average 25 percent of Hispanic/Latino children 
        and 21.4 percent of African-American children ages 6 to 11 are 
        overweight or obese, compared with 13.6 percent of Non-Hispanic White 
        children, and American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents are 50 percent 
        more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to be overweight;
Whereas the financial implications of childhood obesity pose a financial threat 
        to our economy and health care system, carrying up to $14,000,000,000 
        per year in direct health care cost, with people in the United States 
        spending about 10 percent of their total medical costs on obesity-
        related illnesses;
Whereas obese young people have an 80-percent chance of being obese adults and 
        are more likely than children of normal weight to become overweight or 
        obese adults, and therefore more at risk for associated adult health 
        problems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, stroke, 
        several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis;
Whereas in part due to the childhood obesity epidemic, 1 in 3 children (and 
        nearly 1 in 2 minority children) born in the year 2000 will develop type 
        2 diabetes at some point in their lifetime if current trends continue;
Whereas some consequences of childhood and adolescent obesity are psychosocial 
        and can hinder academic and social functioning and persist into 
        adulthood;
Whereas participating in physical activity is important for children and teens 
        as it may have beneficial effects not only on body weight, but also on 
        blood pressure and bone strength;
Whereas proper nutrition is important for children before birth and through 
        their life span as nutrition has beneficial effects for health and body 
        weight, and is important in the prevention of various chronic diseases;
Whereas childhood obesity is preventable; yet for the first time in two 
        centuries, the current generation of children in the United States may 
        have shorter life expectancies than their parents;
Whereas public, community-based, and private sector organizations and 
        individuals throughout the United States are working to decrease 
        childhood obesity rates for people in the United States of all races 
        through a range of efforts, including educational presentations, media 
        campaigns, websites, policies, healthier food options, and greater 
        opportunities for physical activity; and
Whereas September would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Childhood Obesity Awareness Month'' to educate the public about the need 
        for increased education and proactive steps to prevent childhood obesity 
        in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Childhood 
        Obesity Awareness Month'' to raise public awareness and 
        mobilize the country to address childhood obesity;
            (2) recognizes the importance of preventing childhood 
        obesity and decreasing its prevalence in the United States; and
            (3) requests that the President encourage the Federal 
        Government, States, tribes and tribal organizations, 
        localities, schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other 
        entities, and the people of the United States to observe the 
        month with appropriate programs and activities with the goal of 
        promoting healthy eating and physical activity and increasing 
        awareness of childhood obesity among individuals of all ages 
        and walks of life.
