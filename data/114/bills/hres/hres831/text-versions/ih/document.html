                               RESOLUTION


 
Promoting awareness of motorcycle profiling and encourage collaboration 
  and communication with the motorcycle community and law enforcement 
              officials to prevent instances of profiling.

Whereas motorcycle ridership continues to increase over time with registrations 
        growing from 3,826,373 in 1997 to 8,404,687 in 2013;
Whereas a survey conducted by the Motorcycle Profiling Project shows increases 
        in the number of motorcyclists that feel that they are profiled by law 
        enforcement;
Whereas motorcycle profiling means the arbitrary practice of law enforcement 
        using the fact that a person rides a motorcycle or wears motorcycle 
        related apparel as a factor in deciding to stop and question, take 
        enforcement action, arrest, or search a person or vehicle with or 
        without legal basis under the United States Constitution;
Whereas complaints surrounding motorcycle profiling have been cited in all 50 
        States;
Whereas nationwide protests to raise awareness and combat motorcycle profiling 
        have been held in multiple States;
Whereas in 2011, Washington signed into law legislation stating that the 
        criminal justice training commission shall ensure that issues related to 
        motorcycle profiling are addressed in basic law enforcement training and 
        offered to in-service law enforcement officers in conjunction with 
        existing training regarding profiling;
Whereas the 2011, Washington law has reduced profiling incidents by over 90 
        percent and the stops that do occur are being dismissed 100 percent of 
        the time; and
Whereas in the spring of 2016, Maryland became the second State to pass a law 
        addressing the issue of motorcycle profiling: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) promotes increased public awareness on the issue of 
        motorcycle profiling;
            (2) encourages collaboration and communication with the 
        motorcycle community and law enforcement to engage in efforts 
        to end motorcycle profiling; and
            (3) urges State law enforcement officials to include 
        statements condemning motorcycle profiling in written policies 
        and training materials.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
