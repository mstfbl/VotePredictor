                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                              June 9, 2016

Mr. Polis (for himself, Mr. Blumenauer, and Ms. Bonamici) submitted the 
     following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on 
                              Agriculture

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week of June 6 through June 
                  12, 2016, as ``Hemp History Week''.

Whereas Hemp History Week will be held from June 6 through June 12, 2016;
Whereas the goals of Hemp History Week are to commemorate the historical 
        relevance of industrial hemp in the United States and to promote the 
        full growth potential of the industrial hemp industry;
Whereas industrial hemp is an agricultural commodity that has been used for 
        centuries to produce many innovative industrial and consumer products, 
        including soap, fabric, textiles, construction materials, clothing, 
        paper, cosmetics, food, and beverages;
Whereas the global market for hemp is estimated to consist of more than 25,000 
        products;
Whereas the value of hemp imported into the United States for use in the 
        production of other retail products is estimated at approximately 
        $76,000,000 annually;
Whereas the United States hemp industry estimates that the annual market value 
        of hemp retail sales in the United States is more than $570,000,000;
Whereas despite the legitimate uses of hemp, many agricultural producers of the 
        United States are prohibited under current law from growing hemp;
Whereas because most hemp cannot be grown legally in the United States, raw hemp 
        material and hemp products are imported for sale in the United States;
Whereas the United States is the largest consumer of hemp products in the world, 
        but the United States is the only major industrialized country that 
        restricts hemp farming;
Whereas industrial hemp holds great potential to bolster the agricultural 
        economy of the United States; and
Whereas the week of June 6 through June 12, 2016, would be an appropriate week 
        to designate as ``Hemp History Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Hemp History Week'';
            (2) recognizes the historical relevance of industrial hemp; 
        and
            (3) recognizes the growing economic potential of industrial 
        hemp.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
