                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing disapproval of the occupation of Malheur National Wildlife 
                Refuge by a group of armed individuals.

Whereas, on Saturday January 2, 2016, a number of armed individuals broke into 
        and occupied the headquarters building at the Malheur National Wildlife 
        Refuge in Harney County, Oregon;
Whereas these individuals have continued to unlawfully occupy and block access 
        to the refuge headquarters in violation of Federal law, disrupting 
        operations of the refuge;
Whereas these individuals have prevented 20 refuge employees from reporting to 
        work and prevented refuge employees living on the refuge from accessing 
        their homes;
Whereas the unlawful actions of these individuals are harming the local 
        community, including forcing local officials to close public schools in 
        the area for security reasons;
Whereas these actions have forced closure of at least one other Federal facility 
        in the area;
Whereas the Harney County Sheriff and local residents, including Dwight and 
        Steven Hammond, have condemned these unlawful actions;
Whereas recent incidents involving these individuals and similar armed groups 
        have resulted in violence, or threats of violence, toward Federal land 
        managers and local and Federal law enforcement officers;
Whereas those engaged in these unlawful activities have publicly called for more 
        armed individuals to come to the refuge;
Whereas at least one elected official has already offered inflammatory 
        statements supporting these unlawful actions; and
Whereas it is imperative that this unlawful occupation does not escalate into 
        violence: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives condemns the unlawful, 
armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and calls on 
those involved to end their occupation and surrender to law enforcement 
authorities immediately.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
