Whereas in April 1916, through the Easter Rising, an attempt was launched to 
        secure Irish independence;
Whereas signatories to the 1916 Proclamation of the Irish Republic were 
        influenced by the experience of the United States and therefore included

        of goods;
Whereas the United States and Ireland enjoy broad scientific cooperative 
        programs, to the benefit of the United States, Ireland, and Northern

        telecommunications, energy and sustainability, and health;
Whereas the United States and Ireland support thriving bilateral educational 
        exchange programs, which Ireland has promoted in recent years with the

        Generation Study Abroad Program;

        with the ongoing support of the United States, in promoting peace and

        for recommitment to strengthening the relationship between the United 
        States and Ireland for the benefit of future generations in both

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
