                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, a 
          seminal moment in Ireland's journey to independence.

Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising has a particular 
        resonance in the United States;
Whereas, from the foundation of the United States, Irish people and the millions 
        of United States citizens of Irish descent have helped to shape its 
        history;
Whereas, in the words of President John F. Kennedy, ``No people ever believed 
        more deeply in the cause of Irish freedom than the people of the United 
        States'';
Whereas 5 of the 7 signatories of the 1916 Proclamation of Independence spent 
        periods of time in the United States that significantly influenced their 
        thinking and actions;
Whereas the United States is the only foreign country specifically mentioned in 
        the Proclamation;
Whereas the contemporary ties between the United States and Ireland are of 
        extraordinary depth and breadth;
Whereas continued United States engagement in the Northern Ireland peace process 
        is vital to safeguarding the gains made since the Good Friday Agreement;
Whereas the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising offers an opportunity 
        for remembrance, reconciliation, and reimagining of the future;
Whereas, on the 17th and 18th of May 2016, the Taoiseach (Prime Minister of 
        Ireland) will visit Washington, DC, for events commemorating the 100th 
        anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising; and
Whereas more than 200 other commemorative events will take place across the 
        United States to mark the anniversary: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recalls the special ties between Ireland and the United 
        States, continually sustained and strengthened throughout the 
        intertwined history of both countries;
            (2) welcomes the program of commemorations in the United 
        States marking the 100th anniversary of Ireland's 1916 Rising, 
        including the events taking place in Washington DC; and
            (3) recognizes the importance of nurturing and renewing the 
        unique relationship between the United States and Ireland and 
        their peoples into the future.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
