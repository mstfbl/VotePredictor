                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Republic of 
  Korea and expressing the shared vision of the people of the United 
    States and the people of the Republic of Korea for a continued 
                        prosperous relationship.

Whereas the year 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the 
        Republic of Korea on August 15, 1945;
Whereas the thousands of patriots, including innocent civilians who died, were 
        imprisoned, or otherwise dedicated their lives to achieving liberation 
        serve as a testament of the Republic of Korea's enduring strength;
Whereas the Mutual Defense Treaty, signed in Washington, DC, on October 1, 1953, 
        between the United States and the Republic of Korea, has led to more 
        than 62 years of a strong alliance;
Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea are historic allies that 
        share many common values and objectives through security, economic 
        growth, and prosperity;
Whereas the United States recognizes the Republic of Korea's strategic, 
        political, and economic importance to our nation;
Whereas the United States is proud to honor important ethnic holidays, including 
        the goals and ideals of Independence Day in the Republic of Korea;
Whereas the United States applauds the Korean-American community for the 
        important role it plays in the United States-Korean relationship; and
Whereas we express and reaffirm deep friendship with the Korean people, and 
        believe that strong bilateral relations is mutually beneficial and 
        important for United States national priorities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commemorates the 70th anniversary of the liberation of 
        the Republic of Korea; and
            (2) recognizes the Republic of Korea's strategic, 
        political, and economic importance to the United States.
