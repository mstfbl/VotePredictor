  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
  importance of civic education and civic involvement programs in the 
         elementary and secondary schools of the United States.

Whereas civic education, democratic engagement, governmental and constitutional 
        knowledge, and social service in the United States are on the decline;
Whereas in past decades, civic education was a prominent component of the 
        curriculum in our Nation's schools; and
Whereas the advancement of civic education, democratic engagement, governmental 
        and constitutional knowledge, and social service are essential for the 
        future health and welfare of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) civic education, democratic engagement, governmental 
        and constitutional knowledge, and social service are necessary 
        to motivate and inspire future leaders of the United States;
            (2) elementary and secondary schools in the United States 
        are encouraged to offer courses promoting civic education, 
        democratic engagement, governmental and constitutional 
        knowledge, and social service such as civics, government, 
        economics, geography, history, and American history;
            (3) elementary and secondary schools in the United States 
        are encouraged to integrate civic education, democratic 
        engagement, governmental and constitutional knowledge, and 
        social service in electives such as art, English language arts, 
        music, mathematics, and science;
            (4) in order to measure students' basic civic knowledge, 
        secondary schools in the United States are encouraged to 
        administer a test to seniors based on the official list of 100 
        civics questions and answers published and used by the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security for purposes of administering 
        the civics test component of naturalization examinations; and
            (5) elementary and secondary schools in the United States 
        are encouraged to promote civic participation and social 
        service, at Federal, State, and local levels, and encourage 
        such participation from students and families.
