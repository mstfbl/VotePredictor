                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 6, 2015

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
 States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to ensure 
          the continuation of its 6-day mail delivery service.

Whereas the United States Postal Service has announced that it may need to 
        reduce the frequency of its mail delivery service from 6 days a week to 
        5 days a week;
Whereas 6-day mail delivery service is an essential service that the American 
        people have relied on since 1912, particularly working families that 
        depend on the Postal Service for the timely delivery of their paychecks; 
        and
Whereas reducing mail delivery service to 5 days a week would inevitably cause 
        not only delays in the delivery of mail, but higher postal costs, due to 
        the many hours of additional overtime that the Postal Service would 
        require in order to handle the resulting back-up of mail: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures 
to ensure the continuation of its 6-day mail delivery service.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
