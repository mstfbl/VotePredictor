                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of June as National Gun Violence 
    Awareness Month and calling on Congress to address gun violence.

Whereas summer is the season with the highest rates of gun violence in the 
        United States;
Whereas 100,000 Americans suffer gunshot wounds in the United States every year;
Whereas approximately 89 people die and approximately 300 are injured from gun 
        violence each day in the United States;
Whereas more than 50 percent of all gunshot victims in the United States are 
        under 30 years old;
Whereas every 60 minutes one American under the age of 25 loses his or her life 
        to gun violence;
Whereas 5 percent of gun dealers (approximately 3,000 dealers nationwide) supply 
        nearly 90 percent of all crime guns that show up in American streets;
Whereas fewer than 100 people in the United States have been killed in terror 
        attacks since September 11, 2001, but tens of thousands have been killed 
        by gun violence in that same time period;
Whereas more Americans have died from gunshot wounds in the past three decades 
        than the sum total of combat deaths in all the wars in United States 
        history;
Whereas two-thirds of all homicides and half of all suicides are a result of 
        gunshot wounds;
Whereas 90 percent of homicides of law enforcement officers are a result of 
        gunshot wounds;
Whereas firearms used during a robbery are three times more likely than knives 
        and ten times more likely than other weapons to result in the death of a 
        victim;
Whereas 84 percent of homicides against male victims between the ages of 15 to 
        34 are committed with guns;
Whereas 20 percent of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former 
        partner using firearms;
Whereas gun violence declined in the 1990s after the enactment of the Brady 
        Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, which created a national 
        background check system, and the Violent Crime Control and Law 
        Enforcement Act of 1994, which placed a ten-year ban on the sale of 
        assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines;
Whereas with the rise over time of sales in ``no questions asked'' transactions, 
        40 percent of guns sold in America are now done so without a Brady 
        background check;
Whereas the ban on the sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition 
        magazines expired in 2004;
Whereas in 2015, after years of decline, the number of homicides due to gunshot 
        wounds has spiked again in cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, 
        and New Orleans;
Whereas this trend of increasing gun violence may spread;
Whereas in the 16 States that require background checks of private gun sales, 
        there are 38 percent fewer fatal shootings of women by their partners, 
        39 percent fewer police murdered by firearms, 17 percent fewer firearm 
        aggravated assaults, and 49 percent fewer suicides using firearms;
Whereas murder due to gunshot wounds climbed 25 percent in Missouri when 
        universal background checks were lifted;
Whereas 33,636 deaths in the United States were due to guns in 2013; and
Whereas June would be an appropriate month to designate as National Gun Violence 
        Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Gun Violence 
        Awareness Month; and
            (2) calls on Congress to enact the following legislation 
        from the 114th Congress to address gun violence:
                    (A) H.R. 3051, the Background Check Completion Act, 
                to prevent firearms dealers from transferring firearms 
                before a background check of the prospective buyer has 
                been completed.
                    (B) H.R. 752, the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding 
                Device Act, to ban large capacity ammunition magazines.
                    (C) H.R. 3455, the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act 
                of 2015, to limit the trafficking of firearms.
                    (D) H.R. 3130, the Zero Tolerance for Domestic 
                Abusers Act, to protect victims of stalking from gun 
                violence.
                    (E) H.R. 3411, the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2015, and 
                H.R. 1217, the Public Safety and Second Amendment 
                Rights Protection Act of 2015, to require a background 
                check for every gun transfer and to ensure that anyone 
                who is prohibited from buying a gun is listed in the 
                National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
                    (F) Legislation to ban assault weapons.
                                 <all>
