                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding 
               establishing a National Strategic Agenda.

Whereas the United States needs its leaders to pursue policies in the Nation's 
        interest that are of the utmost national priorities;
Whereas the United States faces many fiscal and long-term policy challenges that 
        not only threaten its citizen's opportunities, hopes, and aspirations 
        but its overall ability to be a world leader bringing peace and 
        stability around the world;
Whereas the United States needs its leaders to unite behind common goals and 
        concrete solutions to create the next generation of growth and 
        opportunity;
Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide a long-term vision and priority 
        list for the Nation's future oriented around common goals, that does not 
        exist in the Federal Government today;
Whereas adopting a National Strategic Agenda would bring a long-term vision to a 
        policymaking process that has become too often dominated by short-term 
        political considerations;
Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide a consistent framework and focus 
        the Federal Government's attention on the most urgent problems facing 
        the Nation;
Whereas millions of people in the United States are currently seeking employment 
        opportunities to improve their lives and provide a better future for 
        their children;
Whereas the Federal debt is higher as a percentage of GDP than any time since 
        World War II and will be an unsustainable burden on future generations 
        if left unaddressed;
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare benefits that millions of people in the 
        United States have earned must be preserved and protected;
Whereas a fiscally responsible solution to secure these programs for future 
        generations is needed now as waiting longer will further jeopardize the 
        ability to do so;
Whereas the United States can become energy secure by pursuing an all-of-the-
        above energy plan that includes more affordable and sustainable domestic 
        energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, and building a more 
        reliable and resilient system for energy generation and transmission for 
        the future; and
Whereas the creation and implementation of a new National Strategic Agenda for 
        the United States will require the participation of both the legislative 
        and executive branch along with agreement from all parties to work 
        together: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the four goals of the National Strategic Agenda are 
        to--
                    (A) create 25,000,000 new jobs over the next 10 
                years;
                    (B) balance the Federal budget by 2030;
                    (C) secure Medicare and Social Security for the 
                next 75 years; and
                    (D) make the United States energy secure by 2024;
            (2) the House of Representatives should strive to create, 
        debate, and adopt policy solutions to achieve the four goals of 
        the National Strategic Agenda to address the national interest 
        and priorities represented by the agenda; and
            (3) in achieving success toward the National Strategic 
        Agenda, the goal of the House of Representatives should be to 
        find solutions reached through collaboration, not division, 
        mutual respect, not partisan bickering, and a commitment to 
        honor its public duty to the Nation as duly elected 
        representatives of the people we each represent in 
        congressional districts across the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
