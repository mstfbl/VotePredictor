                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the importance of vaccinations and immunizations in the 
                             United States.

Whereas the contributions of Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner to the discovery of 
        the principles of vaccination and immunology are among the most 
        consequential health findings in human history;
Whereas vaccines have made it possible for the world to have eradicated 
        smallpox, saving approximately 5,000,000 lives annually, and for the 
        international community to be on the brink of eradicating polio and to 
        have saved an estimated 5,000,000 people from this incurable disease 
        over the past 2 decades;
Whereas vaccines have dramatically reduced the spread of many more crippling and 
        potentially life-threatening diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, 
        measles, mumps, and rubella, and vaccines prevent the spread of commonly 
        infectious and potentially fatal diseases such as chickenpox, shingles, 
        influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, meningococcal disease, 
        pneumococcal, rotavirus, and whooping cough (pertussis);
Whereas the scientific and medical communities are in overwhelming consensus 
        that vaccines are both effective and safe, and the dissemination of 
        unfounded, and debunked, theories about the dangers of vaccinations pose 
        a great risk to public health, and scientifically sound education and 
        outreach campaigns about vaccination and immunization are fundamental 
        for a well-informed public;
Whereas an estimated 43,000 adults and 300 children die annually from vaccine-
        preventable diseases or their complications in the United States, and 
        the health and livelihood of young children, seniors, individuals with 
        immunodeficiency disorders, and those who cannot be vaccinated, is 
        particularly compromised by communities with low vaccination rates;
Whereas substantial research has shown that vaccination is a highly cost-
        effective form of preventive medicine, and the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccinations will save 
        nearly $295,000,000,000 in direct costs and $1,380,000,000,000 in total 
        societal costs in the United States;
Whereas it is estimated that vaccinations will prevent more than 21,000,000 
        hospitalizations and 732,000 deaths among children born in the last 20 
        years, and that more than 100,000,000 children all over the world are 
        immunized each year and vaccines have saved an estimated 2,500,000 
        children annually;
Whereas 1 in 5 children worldwide still lack access to even the most basic 
        vaccines and as a result, an estimated 1,500,000 children a year die 
        from vaccine-preventable conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia or 
        suffer from permanently debilitating illnesses;
Whereas a strong investment in medical research to improve existing vaccines and 
        develop many more life-saving vaccines is beneficial to all, both at 
        home and abroad, and a robust immunization infrastructure is essential 
        to the public health and well-being of the people of the United States 
        by preventing and isolating outbreaks of contagious diseases where they 
        start;
Whereas encouraging high vaccination rates in the United States protects our 
        citizens from contracting vaccine-preventable diseases that are pandemic 
        in countries with low vaccination and immunization rates;
Whereas routine and up-to-date immunization is the most effective method 
        available to prevent the infection and transmission of potentially fatal 
        diseases; and
Whereas the United States has been a leader in promoting vaccinations around the 
        world through U.S. Agency for International Development, the CDC, Gavi, 
        the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, UNICEF, 
        the World Health Organization, and a host of other multilateral and non-
        governmental organizations: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the international community, global and 
        domestic health organizations, the private sector, school and 
        community leaders, and faith-based organizations for their 
        tireless work and immense contributions to bolstering our 
        global and domestic health through vaccination;
            (2) affirms vaccines and immunizations save lives and are 
        essential to maintain the public health, economic and national 
        security of the people of the United States;
            (3) recognizes that the lack of vaccination can cause a 
        true public health crisis, and that there is no credible 
        evidence to show that vaccines cause life-threatening or 
        disabling diseases in healthy children or adults;
            (4) encourages a continued commitment to research to 
        improve vaccines and to develop new vaccines against other 
        infectious and fatal diseases; and
            (5) urges parents, in consultation with their health care 
        provider, to follow the scientific evidence and consensus of 
        medical experts in favor of timely vaccinations to protect 
        their children and their community.
