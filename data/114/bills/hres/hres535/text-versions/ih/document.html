                               RESOLUTION


 
  Condemning in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in Beirut, 
Lebanon, on November 12, 2015, that resulted in the loss of at least 43 
                                 lives.

Whereas, on November 12, 2015, terrorists affiliated with the so-called 
        ``Islamic State of Iraq and Syria'' (ISIS) claimed responsibility for 
        coordinated attacks in Beirut, Lebanon, that resulted in the loss of 
        innocent life and the injury of more than 200 people;
Whereas ISIS claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on numerous targets 
        in Paris, France, on November 13, 2015, that killed at least 129 people 
        and injured over 400 more;
Whereas ISIS claimed responsibility for the downing of a Russian airliner on 
        October 31, 2015, over the Sinai Peninsula that resulted in the deaths 
        of all 224 passengers;
Whereas the attacks in Beirut were executed at the peak of evening rush hour to 
        maximize casualties, targeting both Christians and Muslims alike;
Whereas the blasts targeted innocent civilians in a predominantly residential 
        area, that is near a hospital and whose streets are lined with markets;
Whereas this heinous attack in Beirut marked the second of three large-scale 
        attacks claimed by ISIS against innocent civilian populations since 
        October 31, 2015;
Whereas November 13, 2015, marked a national day of mourning for the Lebanese 
        people;
Whereas the United States Embassy in Beirut strongly condemned the ``horrific 
        terrorist'' attacks in Beirut and offered condolences ``to the families 
        and other loved ones of those killed and injured in this violence'';
Whereas the White House and the Department of State condemned in the strongest 
        terms the bombing in Beirut and wished a swift recovery to the wounded;
Whereas the United States Government has offered assistance to the Lebanese 
        authorities in investigating the attack;
Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the people of 
        Lebanon to ensure these heinous attacks do not ``destroy the relative 
        calm that has prevailed in the country over the past year'';
Whereas Lebanon has hosted a large number of Syrian refugees and worked with 
        relief organizations to provide needed humanitarian assistance;
Whereas the United States stands in continued solidarity with the Lebanese 
        people and reaffirms its commitment to promoting a secure, sovereign, 
        and prosperous Lebanon;
Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation and information sharing 
        on emerging threats with the Lebanese Armed Forces greatly improves 
        security for the people of the United States and their partners around 
        the world; and
Whereas in its time of national mourning, the United States stands ready to 
        provide assistance to Lebanon in bringing to justice all those involved 
        in the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as in 
        identifying and thwarting any planning to undertake similar egregious 
        acts in the future: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks 
        in Beirut, Lebanon, on November 12, 2015, that resulted in the 
        loss of at least 43 lives;
            (2) expresses its condolences to the families and friends 
        of those individuals who were killed or injured in the attacks 
        and expresses its sympathies to those injured;
            (3) supports the Government of Lebanon in its efforts to 
        bring to justice all those involved in the planning and 
        execution of these terrorist attacks; and
            (4) expresses its readiness to continue assisting the 
        Lebanese Armed Forces and people of Lebanon to respond to the 
        growing terrorist threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and 
        Syria (ISIS) as well as its terrorist affiliates, and to 
        provide continued support to refugee populations within 
        Lebanon.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
