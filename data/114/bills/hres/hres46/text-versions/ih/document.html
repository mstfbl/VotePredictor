                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives condemning the 
recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria that resulted in the deaths of over 
  2,000 innocent persons and offering condolences to those personally 
                     affected by this cowardly act.

Whereas, on January 3, 2015, the armed radical terrorist group known as Boko 
        Haram captured the town of Baga, Nigeria, and overran the Multi National 
        Joint Task Force headquarters and army base in town and slaughtered over 
        2,000 people over a period of a few days.
Whereas forces of Government of Nigeria resisted the terrorists who ``attacked 
        from all sides'', for several hours, but eventually ``joined civilians 
        fleeing into the bush'';
Whereas in the days following the assault, the terrorists forced Baga's 
        residents into the surrounding area villages;
Whereas, on the evening of January 6, 2015, two local residents reported that 
        the militants began to burn local buildings using petrol bombs and 
        explosives, and according to survivors proceeded to kill those left;
Whereas, according to Musa Bukar, head of the Kukawa local government area, all 
        16 villages in the local government area were razed as well, and their 
        residents either killed or forced to flee;
Whereas Baba Abba Hassan, the district head, added that ``hundreds of corpses 
        still lay on the streets'' of the town and that many women and children 
        were among the victims, having been pursued into the bush by the 
        militants;
Whereas Baga and at least 16 other towns are thought to have been destroyed as 
        over 35,000 people are reported to have been displaced, with many feared 
        to have drowned while trying to cross Lake Chad and others trapped on 
        islands in the lake;
Whereas these terrorist attacks represent an assault on fundamental principles 
        essential to a democratic society;
Whereas the increase in attacks in Nigeria and throughout Africa remains of 
        great concern;
Whereas the United States and Africa share a longstanding cultural, political, 
        and economic relationship that has greatly benefitted both nations; and
Whereas the United States is committed to supporting Nigeria in this difficult 
        time: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Baga, Nigeria, 
        that resulted in the tragic loss of over 2,000 innocent lives;
            (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by 
        this tragedy;
            (3) supports the efforts of the Government of Nigeria to 
        ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported 
        these heinous attacks are brought to justice;
            (4) recognizes the growing threat posed by radical 
        terrorist groups worldwide and reaffirms the commitment of the 
        United States to the multilateral, global fight against such 
        violent extremists;
            (5) calls upon all nations to join a global effort to 
        combat violent extremist ideologies and terrorist groups; and
            (6) remains committed to the defense of democratic 
        principles as well as other universal values that terrorists 
        seek to destroy through a campaign of cowardly threats and 
        reprehensible violence.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
