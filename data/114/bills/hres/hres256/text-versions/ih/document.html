                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of May as Stroke Awareness Month.

Whereas stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, is an acute neurologic 
        injury that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is 
        interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the artery;
Whereas stroke is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurologic damage 
        or even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated;
Whereas in the United States, stroke is now the fifth leading cause of death;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 person 
        in the United States dies from stroke every 4 minutes;
Whereas every year, approximately 795,000 people in the United States have a 
        stroke;
Whereas the direct (medical) costs of stroke are $17.5 billion annually and 
        total costs (both medical and lost productivity) are $33.6 billion;
Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability;
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical, occupational, speech-
        language and other therapy and surgeries;
Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments resulting from stroke have 
        a considerable impact on children, families, and society; and
Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as National Stroke 
        Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Stroke Awareness Month;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to support 
        the efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations 
        that work to enhance public awareness of stroke; and
            (3) encourages continued coordination and cooperation 
        between government, researchers, families, and the public to 
        improve treatments and prognoses for individuals who suffer 
        strokes.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
