                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
 restoration of authority of the American people and the separation of 
                                powers.

Whereas the solemn purpose of the Federal Government of the United States is to 
        ensure national peace and security, protect freedom and justice, and 
        promote the well-being of the American people;
Whereas in order to secure people's rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
        happiness, the American people establish their government to represent 
        their will and rights;
Whereas the Federal Government derives all of its authority solely from the 
        people, who exercise and affirm their rights through their elected 
        representatives;
Whereas a government for the people and by the people is only realized through 
        representative government that guarantees the people's sovereign 
        authority;
Whereas all legitimate Federal power of the United States is delegated by the 
        American people through the Constitution of the United States and 
        elections;
Whereas the Constitution of the United States was established by the American 
        people in order to establish justice, promote the general welfare, and 
        secure the blessings of liberty;
Whereas the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and 
        judicial branches, and the checks and balances each branch has on the 
        others' legitimate powers, make up the main structural mechanism by 
        which the Constitution limits power, assures responsible government, and 
        prevents tyranny;
Whereas article I, section 1 of the Constitution, expressly states that ``All 
        legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the 
        United States'';
Whereas Congress is also responsible for conducting thorough oversight of all 
        Federal agencies;
Whereas our representative government can only serve this role on behalf of the 
        American people when constitutional checks and balances to protect 
        people's power are respected by their government;
Whereas the value of representation most clearly manifests itself when the 
        American people are able to express their imagination, ambitions, and 
        conscience through their representatives, who they hold directly 
        accountable;
Whereas our representative government is intended, above all, to provide 
        recourse to United States citizens through the electoral process;
Whereas when government fails to meet the reasonable standards of 
        accountability, transparency, and restraint established in the 
        Constitution, the rights of the American people are infringed;
Whereas a representative government fails the people when it creates and 
        implements mandates without the input and approval of the people's 
        representatives;
Whereas executive branch departments and agencies currently generate and enforce 
        their own rules and regulations with the force of law upon the people 
        without the approval of their representatives;
Whereas there are few available forms of sufficient recourse for the people in 
        response to these overreaches;
Whereas there are increasing incidents of executive overreach being made by 
        departments and agencies that have exercised unaccountable lawmaking 
        power;
Whereas this extension of executive authority stands in violation of core 
        principles and limitations of our representative government, which 
        exists to serve the people, not the reverse;
Whereas the judiciary has also exceeded its authority, disregarding the 
        limitation on its own use of power and the duly enacted statutes of 
        Congress;
Whereas our representative government can only be restored when the people 
        regain the authority to hold directly accountable those in government 
        who make laws; and
Whereas each Member of Congress has given the solemn oath to support and defend 
        the Constitution of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms its commitment to recovering all powers of 
        the American people expressly delegated to the legislative 
        branch in article I of the Constitution;
            (2) recognizes its unique duty to preserve and perpetuate 
        representative government in the United States by recovering 
        its exclusive duty to make law;
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to maintaining the separation 
        of powers for the people through proper and thorough oversight 
        of the executive branch and its departments and agencies;
            (4) declares its intent to reclaim legislative powers from 
        executive branch departments and agencies, whether improperly 
        claimed or previously granted, by which the American people are 
        governed without their consent;
            (5) reaffirms Congress' authority as delegated by the 
        people to lay and collect taxes, pay debts, and provide for the 
        common defense and general welfare of the United States;
            (6) reaffirms its authority on behalf of the people to make 
        rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces; 
        and
            (7) reaffirms the House of Representatives intent to 
        recover all powers and rights faithfully entrusted to it by the 
        American people, and to restore the separation of powers 
        between branches of the Federal Government and the associated 
        balance and protections it affords, as expressed by the people 
        in the Constitution of the United States, which is the binding 
        manifestation of their will and consent.
