                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
 Government of Mexico should forthwith repatriate the remains of those 
    American Soldiers who fought in the battle of Monterrey in 1846.

Whereas 169 years ago this September, Brigadier General Zachary Taylor led a 
        6,000 man military force consisting of United States Regulars, 
        Volunteers and Texas Rangers to capture the strategic town of Monterrey;
Whereas after three days of fighting, Taylor's forces captured Monterrey on 
        September 23, 1846;
Whereas the United States suffered 120 casualties during the battle, while 368 
        were wounded and 43 were reported missing;
Whereas the Mexican Government's Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Historia 
        (INAH), in cooperation with the United States Department of State and 
        the United States Department of the Army's Armed Forces Medical Examiner 
        (AFME), has positively identified the remains of 11 United States 
        soldiers who fought in the battle of Monterrey in 1846; and
Whereas United States Department of State is working with the Mexican Government 
        to secure the repatriation of these remains: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the archaeologists, the Instituto Nacional de 
        Antropologia y Historia, the United States Consulate General 
        Monterrey and all those individuals whose diligent work led to 
        the identification and recovery of these remains; and
            (2) calls upon the Government of Mexico and the Mexican 
        Secretariat of Foreign Affairs to expeditiously release and 
        repatriate the identified remains of these United States 
        soldiers.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
