H. Res. 658

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 23, 2016.
Whereas, on March 22, 2016, at least three Islamist terrorists conducted 
        coordinated attacks against two sites in Brussels, Belgium, resulting in 
        the loss of more than 30 innocent lives and the severe wounding of many 
        more innocent civilians;
Whereas a number of American citizens are among those wounded;
Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has claimed responsibility 
        for the attacks;
Whereas the brutal attacks at the Brussels airport and the Maelbeek metro 
        station are the latest in a series of assaults by ISIS in Europe, 
        including the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, France, 
        that were deliberately aimed at killing and maiming as many innocent 
        people as possible;
Whereas Belgian first responders and law enforcement reacted swiftly and 
        heroically, caring for the wounded and taking immediate measures to 
        prevent additional attacks and the further loss of life;
Whereas at least two of the terrorists were killed in the suicide bombings, and 
        Belgian intelligence and law enforcement are pursuing others possibly 
        connected to these attacks and to those in Paris;
Whereas Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called the attacks ``a black 
        moment'' for the country and urged his fellow citizens to stay united in 
        their response;
Whereas Belgium and its capital Brussels are the symbolic center of the alliance 
        between the United States and Europe that was created following the 
        devastation of World War II, including by hosting on its territory the 
        headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the 
        institutions of the European Union;
Whereas Belgium and the United States have maintained strong ties based on 
        shared values since Belgium's independence in 1831;
Whereas Belgium was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and has been a steadfast 
        ally of the United States in the decades since;
Whereas, on September 12, 2001, for the first time in the history of the 
        Alliance, Belgium joined our NATO allies to invoke Article 5 of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty that states ``an armed attack against one or more 
        of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against 
        them all'';
Whereas Belgium has been a steadfast partner of the United States in the 
        international effort to defeat ISIS and other terrorist threats;
Whereas the coordination of these attacks, following the terrorist assaults in 
        Paris and in several other countries, demonstrates that ISIS members 
        continue to plan and execute attacks, targeting United States interests 
        and allies;
Whereas continued and enhanced intelligence cooperation, law enforcement 
        engagement, and information sharing on emerging threats and identified 
        Islamist extremists is essential to enhancing security for the people of 
        the United States, Europe, and our allies around the world;
Whereas the loss of innocent lives in Brussels strengthens our resolve to defeat 
        ISIS and its terrorist affiliates which pose a growing threat to 
        international peace and stability; and
Whereas we stand in solidarity with our Belgian allies in their time of national 
        mourning, ready to provide assistance in bringing to justice all those 
        involved with the planning and execution of these attacks, as well as 
        identifying and disrupting any plans to undertake similar assaults in 
        the future: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in 
        Brussels on March 22, 2016, which murdered more than 30 innocent people, 
        and severely wounded many more;
            (2) expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences for those 
        killed and injured in the attacks and for their families and friends;
            (3) pledges support for the Government of Belgium in its efforts to 
        bring to justice all those involved with the planning and execution of 
        these terrorist attacks;
            (4) declares that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) poses a 
        fundamental threat to the universal value of freedom in all countries;
            (5) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign fighters to and 
        from the Middle East and West and North Africa and the threat posed by 
        these individuals; and
            (6) expresses its readiness to assist the Government and people of 
        Belgium to respond to the threat posed by ISIS and its terrorist 
        affiliates.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
