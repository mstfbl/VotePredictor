Whereas, Mr. Shahdaiah's family is very proud of his love for school and has 
        emphasized his keen commitment to all that he undertook, sharing with 
        others the many highlights of his high school career;
Whereas, through his dedication to his studies, Mr. Shahdaiah earned a grade 
        point average of 3.6 and was inducted into the National Society of High 
        School Scholars;
Whereas, as a highly accomplished student-athlete, Mr. Shahdaiah served the 
        U.S.A. International Football Team as Captain, Team Ambassador and 
        starting linebacker;
Whereas, additionally, Mr. Shahdaiah exalted fervent school pride, during his 
        junior year as a highly valued teammate of the DeKaney Wildcats, his 
        high school varsity track and football teams;
Whereas, expanding the bounds of his requisite studies, Mr. Shahdaiah explored 
        his curiosities for the world of science becoming a member of the Texas

        kindness and dedication that Mr. Shahdaiah exhibited regularly as a son, 
        student, friend and incredibly well-rounded, commendable young man;
Whereas, the accolades this young man earned far exceed the highest expectations 
        of any proud parent or community member in awe of an exceptional young

Whereas, Mr. Shahdaiah cultivated his efforts, positioning himself to 
        successfully matriculate in May of 2016; and, but for his ill-fated 
        passing, would by all accounts have celebrated his well-deserved 
        accomplishments with his family as a milestone achievement in his young 
        life;
Whereas, there is no doubt Mr. Shahdaiah would have realized countless 
        ambitions, his family and friends are left to accept that his dreams of 
        immeasurable magnitude now rest with him;
Whereas, this young man worked hard, yet humbly, for his success and one cannot 
        think of a more solemn manner of celebrating his life than to honor his 
        efforts by recognizing the achievements for which he so ardently strode; 
        and
Whereas, the Shahdaiah family should be thanked for their dedication in raising 
        their son and his contributions to the future of this Nation: Now, 
        therefore, be it
