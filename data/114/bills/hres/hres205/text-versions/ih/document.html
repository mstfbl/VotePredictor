                               RESOLUTION


 
   Congratulating the administration, staff, students, and alumni of 
     Roosevelt University on the occasion of the University's 70th 
                              anniversary.

Whereas, on April 17, 2015, Roosevelt University, located in Chicago, Illinois, 
        will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the University on 
        April 17, 1945;
Whereas Roosevelt University has graduated more than 95,000 students who have 
        become leaders in their professions and careers, including Chicago's 
        first African-American mayor, Harold Washington;
Whereas Roosevelt University was founded at a time when most American 
        universities and colleges did not enroll large numbers of minority or 
        immigrant students;
Whereas Roosevelt University became one of the Nation's first colleges to admit 
        all qualified students, regardless of race, religion, or national 
        origin;
Whereas throughout its history, Roosevelt University has always remained true to 
        the values of inclusiveness, opportunity, and social justice; and
Whereas today, Roosevelt remains one of the most diverse universities in the 
        Midwest: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the administration, staff, students, and 
        alumni of Roosevelt University on the occasion of the 
        University's 70th anniversary; and
            (2) wishes the entire Roosevelt community many years of 
        continued success in the future.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
