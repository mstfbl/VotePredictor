                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the President and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
  to submit to Congress the text of all side agreements entered into 
between the IAEA and Iran with respect to the Joint Comprehensive Plan 
                               of Action.

Whereas Iran has a reputation and history of deception within the international 
        community regarding its nuclear ambitions;
Whereas in 2005, then International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Deputy Director 
        General Pierre Goldschmidt compiled a briefing for the IAEA Board of 
        Governors which laid out a long list of attempts by Iran to hide, 
        mislead, and delay the work of IAEA inspectors with respect to Iran's 
        nuclear program;
Whereas the IAEA has entered into numerous side agreements with Iran on 
        inspection protocols and the possible military dimensions of Iran's 
        current and past nuclear program;
Whereas under section 135 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160e), as 
        added by section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 
        (Public Law 114-17; 129 Stat. 201), Congress should be provided with all 
        documents associated with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
        (JCPOA), agreed to on July 14, 2015, including all ``annexes, 
        appendices, codicils, side agreements, implementing materials, 
        documents, and guidance, technical or other understandings, and any 
        related agreements, whether entered into or implemented prior to the 
        agreement or to be entered into or implemented in the future'';
Whereas the Administration acknowledges that it knows the contents of such side 
        agreements between the IAEA and Iran;
Whereas the IAEA expects inspections of Iran's nuclear program under the JCPOA 
        to require an additional $10,600,000 in funding annually to be 
        effective;
Whereas 25 percent of the IAEA base budget and 42 percent of the total IAEA 
        budget is provided by the United States; and
Whereas the additional funding required with respect to Iran's nuclear program 
        under the JCPOA will predictably be largely provided by the United 
        States and contingent on approval of Congress: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges, as a condition 
for Congress approving additional United States funding to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the President and the IAEA 
submit to Congress the text of all side agreements entered into between 
the IAEA and Iran with respect to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action.
