H. Res. 162

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 23, 2015.
Whereas the existence of an independent, democratic, and prosperous Ukraine is 
        in the national interest of the United States;
Whereas the Russian Federation under President Vladimir Putin has engaged in 
        relentless political, economic, and military aggression to subvert the 
        independence and violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine;
Whereas this aggression includes the illegal and forcible occupation of Crimea 
        by Russian military and security forces;
Whereas this Russian aggression includes the establishment and control of 
        violent separatist proxies in other areas of Ukraine, including arming 
        them with lethal weapons and other materiel including tanks, artillery, 
        and rockets that have enabled separatist militias to launch and sustain 
        an insurrection that has resulted in over 6,000 dead, 15,000 wounded, 
        and more than a million displaced persons;
Whereas military and security forces of the Russian Federation have been 
        infiltrated into these areas of Ukraine and continue to provide direct 
        combat support to the separatist groups in this conflict;
Whereas failure to stop this aggression by the Russian Federation against 
        Ukraine, especially its unprovoked and armed intervention in a sovereign 
        country, illegal and forcible occupation of its territory, and 
        unilateral efforts to redraw the internationally-recognized borders of 
        Ukraine undermines the foundation of the international order that was 
        established and has been defended at great cost by the United States and 
        its allies in the aftermath of World War II;
Whereas Russian aggression against Ukraine is but the most visible and recent 
        manifestation of a revisionist Kremlin strategy to redraw international 
        borders and impose its will on its neighbors, including NATO allies;
Whereas on September 18, 2014, President Petro Poroshenko addressed a Joint 
        Meeting of Congress at which he thanked the United States for the 
        military assistance it has provided to defend the freedom and 
        territorial integrity of his country and asked for ``both non-lethal and 
        lethal'' military assistance, stating that ``one cannot win a war with 
        blankets'';
Whereas the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey stated 
        on March 3, 2015, that ``we should absolutely consider providing lethal 
        aid'' to Ukraine;
Whereas Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated on February 4, 2015, during 
        his confirmation hearing that he is ``very much inclined'' toward 
        providing Ukraine with weapons to defend itself;
Whereas Congress provided the President with the authorization and budgetary 
        resources to provide Ukraine with military assistance to enhance its 
        ability to defend its sovereign territory from the unprovoked and 
        continuing aggression of the Russian Federation, including in the 
        Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014, which was signed into law on 
        December 18, 2014;
Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 specifically authorizes the 
        provision of anti-armor weapons, crew-served weapons and ammunition, 
        counter-artillery radars, fire control, range finder, and optical and 
        guidance and control equipment, tactical troop-operated surveillance 
        drones, and secure command and communications equipment;
Whereas even as it faces a massive military assault, Ukraine is confronting an 
        economic crisis that requires both long-term financial and technical 
        assistance by the United States and the international community, 
        especially the countries of the European Union and the International 
        Monetary Fund, as well as fundamental economic and political reforms by 
        the government of Ukraine;
Whereas the United States and its allies should provide assistance to support 
        energy diversification and efficiency initiatives in Ukraine to lessen 
        its vulnerability to coercion by the Russian Federation;
Whereas the United States and its allies should continue to work with Ukrainian 
        officials to develop plans to increase energy production and efficiency 
        in order to increase energy security beyond the short-term;
Whereas the United States, in close cooperation with international donors, has 
        provided Ukraine with macro-economic assistance to boost Ukraine's 
        economy; and
Whereas the United States and its allies need a long-term strategy to expose and 
        challenge Vladimir Putin's corruption and repression at home and his 
        aggression abroad: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives strongly urges the President to 
fully and immediately exercise the authorities provided by Congress to provide 
Ukraine with lethal defensive weapon systems to enhance the ability of the 
people of Ukraine to defend their sovereign territory from the unprovoked and 
continuing aggression of the Russian Federation.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
