    Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to 
consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1270) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of

accounts and health flexible spending arrangements. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of 
a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now printed in the 
bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 114-60 shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, 
shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, 
as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
