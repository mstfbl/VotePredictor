                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
committees of jurisdiction in the House of Representatives should craft 
replacement language for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
   that includes the amendments made to the Black Lung Benefits Act.

Whereas men and women who spend their lives mining coal deserve the black lung 
        benefits afforded them through the Black Lung Benefits Act;
Whereas these critical benefits are important for thousands of men and women 
        across the United States;
Whereas since 1969, black lung benefits have been guaranteed by the Federal 
        Government and have provided assistance for miners and their widows;
Whereas in 1981, the Black Lung Benefits Act was amended tightening eligibility 
        requirements and eliminating two provisions regarding coal miners' and 
        survivors' entitlement benefits;
Whereas the Black Lung Benefits Act was restored and amended into the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act, providing equity for certain 
        eligible survivors;
Whereas the House of Representatives passed a repeal of the Patient Protection 
        and Affordable Care Act on February 3, 2015, instructing committees of 
        jurisdiction to craft replacement language; and
Whereas current black lung benefits should not be reduced but should be 
        preserved and protected: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the committees of jurisdiction in the House of Representatives should 
craft replacement language for the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act that includes the amendments that restored the Black Lung 
Benefits Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
