                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             April 15, 2015

  Mr. Takai (for himself and Mr. Bridenstine) submitted the following

                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of April 2015 as ``National Learn to 
                             Swim Month''.

Whereas U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that 
        represents 60,000 USMS adult members who swim with its more than 1,000 
        local adult swim programs across the country;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 37 
        percent of adults and 21 percent of children in the United States could 
        not save themselves if they fell in water over their heads;
Whereas with the inability to swim affecting people's lives in a broad spectrum 
        of ways with direct negative implications on quality of life;
Whereas drowning is a problem we can solve, teaching adults to swim is the 
        central cause of the Swimming Saves Lives Foundation, the charitable arm 
        of USMS, and its foundation partners;
Whereas the Swimming Saves Lives Foundation makes available grants and resources 
        to swimming programs in the United States so that they may teach 
        potentially hundreds of adults who might not otherwise have the 
        opportunity;
Whereas the grants and resources are privately provided by the charitable and 
        generous contributions of 60,000 USMS members and supporters;
Whereas April is the ideal month for this designation as pools and other bodies 
        of water open for the spring and summer seasons; and
Whereas nationally, April is being recognized as Learn to Swim Month, and with 
        the help of State governments throughout the Nation highlighting this 
        lifesaving effort, the commendable goal of making water available for 
        fun, fitness and health to our fellow non-swimming neighbors can be 
        attained: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Learn to Swim Month''.
                                 <all>
