                               RESOLUTION


 
 Calling upon the President to declare a National Day of Prayer to end 
    targeted violence against law enforcement officers and schedule 
          appropriate public events in support of such a day.

Whereas all human lives have dignity and worth and are deserving of protection 
        under the law;
Whereas a pattern of violence is emerging against police officers in which 
        officers are targeted for wearing a police uniform and performing their 
        legitimate duties under the law;
Whereas, on August 28, 2015, Deputy Sheriff Darren H. Goforth was targeted and 
        assassinated in Harris County, Texas, while wearing his police uniform;
Whereas gunfire was directed at police officers during protests in Ferguson, 
        Missouri, on March 12, 2015, and August 9, 2015;
Whereas New York City Police Department officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu 
        were targeted and assassinated in New York, New York, while they sat in 
        a patrol car on December 20, 2014;
Whereas law enforcement is a dangerous profession under any circumstances, but 
        this pattern of attacks makes the job even more dangerous;
Whereas the number of police officers killed by firearms increased by 56 percent 
        between 2013 and 2014; and
Whereas ``ambush killings'' were the leading cause of police officer fatalities 
        in firearm-related deaths in 2014: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls upon the 
President to declare a National Day of Prayer to end targeted violence 
against law enforcement officers and schedule appropriate public events 
in support of such a day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
