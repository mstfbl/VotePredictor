                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the Weatherization Assistance Program during its 40th 
   anniversary year for its history of reducing the energy costs of 
 families with low incomes, making low-income households healthier and 
 safer, positively impacting the environment, and supporting jobs and 
                            new technology.

Whereas Congress has long recognized the disproportionate energy burden on 
        families and individuals with low incomes;
Whereas Congress and the Department of Energy developed the Weatherization 
        Assistance Program in 1976 to increase the energy efficiency of 
        dwellings owned or occupied by low-income persons, reduce their total 
        residential energy expenditures, and improve their health and safety, 
        especially low-income persons who are particularly vulnerable such as 
        the elderly, persons with disabilities, families with children, high 
        residential energy users, and households with a high energy burden;
Whereas low-income households on average pay 7.2 percent of household income on 
        utilities, more than three times the amount that higher income 
        households pay;
Whereas at least a quarter of low-income households in many regions experience 
        an energy burden greater than 14 percent of income;
Whereas nearly 9,000,000 families across the Nation live in energy inefficient, 
        unhealthy homes;
Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program operates in all 50 States, the 
        District of Columbia, 5 United States Territories, and Indian tribal 
        governments;
Whereas over 7,400,000 homes have been weatherized since the inception of the 
        program in 1976;
Whereas in a typical year the Weatherization Assistance Program produces over 
        $300,000,000 in energy cost savings;
Whereas a typical low-income family saves between $250 and $450 per year after 
        receiving weatherization services;
Whereas every dollar invested in weatherization returns $4.10 to society in 
        energy, health, and safety benefits;
Whereas children in households that received weatherization services missed 
        fewer days of school due to reduced incidences of asthma, respiratory 
        difficulties, and other health-related issues;
Whereas investment in the Weatherization Assistance Program by the Federal 
        Government and other sources supports more than 25,000 jobs across the 
        country within related industries;
Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program decreases pollution and improves 
        air quality;
Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program has increased its impact through a 
        strategic partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services 
        Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP);
Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program has implemented rigorous quality 
        control standards and procedures;
Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program has incorporated cutting edge 
        technologies such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and rooftop solar; and
Whereas by decreasing the amount of personal income spent on home energy, the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program makes housing more affordable, 
        improves the quality of life for families with low incomes, reduces 
        forced mobility, and increases national energy security: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the Weatherization Assistance Program for 40 
        years of reducing the energy burden of families with low 
        incomes, making low-income households healthier and safer, 
        positively impacting the environment, and supporting jobs and 
        new technology;
            (2) encourages the Weatherization Assistance Program to 
        continue performing essential weatherization services going 
        forward;
            (3) applauds the dedicated professionals at the Federal, 
        State, and local levels who run the daily operations of the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program; and
            (4) congratulates the Weatherization Assistance Program on 
        the 40th anniversary year of its signature into law on August 
        14, 1976.
