                               RESOLUTION


 
   Calling on the President to work toward equitable, constructive, 
 stable, and durable Armenian-Turkish relations for the next 100 years 
 based upon the two countries' common interests and the United States' 
             significant security interests in the region.

Whereas the Obama Administration has, since early 2009, sought to improve 
        Armenian-Turkish relations; and
Whereas at the start of this process, President Barack Obama had, on April 6, 
        2009, voiced the United States Government's expectation that the 
        Armenia-Turkey dialogue would ``bear fruit very quickly'', but recent 
        attempts to reestablish diplomatic relations have been unsuccessful: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on the President 
to work toward equitable, constructive, stable, and durable Armenian-
Turkish relations for the next 100 years, based upon the two countries' 
common interests and the United States' significant security interests 
in the region.
                                 <all>
