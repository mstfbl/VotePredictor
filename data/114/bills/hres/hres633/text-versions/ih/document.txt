                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the important work of Meals on Wheels America and senior 
   nutrition programs throughout the Nation in addressing hunger and 
isolation and improving the health and quality of life for millions of 
                    our Nation's seniors each year.

Whereas Meals on Wheels America is the oldest and largest organization in the 
        Nation and represents community-based senior nutrition programs in every 
        State that provide nutritious meals to our most vulnerable Americas;
Whereas thousands of meals on wheels programs under the Older Americans Act of 
        1965 (both congregate and home-delivered) provide a vital lifeline to 
        millions of men and women in cities, suburban areas, and rural 
        communities across America to seniors 60 years of age or older who are 
        homebound, struggling with hunger, isolated, or otherwise vulnerable and 
        at risk;
Whereas meals on wheels programs (both congregate and home-delivered) provide 
        nutritious meals, friendly visits, and wellness and safety checks, to 
        individuals who suffer from long-term chronic conditions, as well as 
        those who may just need short-term assistance;
Whereas good nutrition is essential to supporting and promoting health, and the 
        meals provided by meals on wheels programs (both congregate and home-
        delivered) through volunteers and staff protect and contribute to the 
        overall health and well-being of America's seniors;
Whereas meals on wheels programs are proven and effective public-private 
        partnerships saving significant taxpayer dollars and expenses, often 
        paid through Medicare and Medicaid, by reducing falls, avoiding 
        unnecessary trips, admissions and readmissions to the hospital, 
        expediting recovery from illness, and delaying or preventing 
        institutionalization for seniors in need;
Whereas meals on wheels programs (both congregate and home-delivered) serve this 
        Nation's over-60 population, which is rapidly growing and projected to 
        increase dramatically each year over the next several decades;
Whereas the demand and need for the meals on wheels programs will continue to 
        increase at an astounding pace;
Whereas meals on wheels programs are needed to free vulnerable seniors from 
        hunger and social isolation;
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed into law a measure 
        that amended the Older Americans Act of 1965 and established a national 
        nutrition program for seniors 60 years and older;
Whereas in 2002, Meals on Wheels America established the March for Meals 
        campaign to recognize the historic month and the importance of the Older 
        Americans Act of 1965 nutrition programs (both congregate and home-
        delivered), and to raise awareness about the escalating problem of 
        senior hunger and isolation in America;
Whereas meals on wheels programs across the Nation have recruited more than 
        2,600 Members of Congress, governors, local elected officials, 
        celebrities, and prominent community leaders as champions to help raise 
        awareness for senior hunger and to participate in March for Meals 
        activities; and
Whereas the 2016 observance of March for Meals provides an opportunity to 
        support Meals on Wheels programs that deliver vital and critical 
        services by donating food, volunteering services, and raising awareness 
        to reduce senior hunger and isolation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes and honors the important work of Meals on 
        Wheels America and senior nutrition programs throughout the 
        Nation in giving voice to and addressing senior hunger and 
        isolation, and improving the quality of life, for millions of 
        our Nation's seniors each year;
            (2) recognizes and honors the important role Meals on 
        Wheels America and senior nutrition programs' March for Meals 
        celebrations play in increasing awareness of the growing unmet 
        need for, and in raising additional non-Federal funds and 
        soliciting volunteers to support and assist, these programs in 
        accomplishing their important missions;
            (3) recognizes and honors meals on wheels volunteers as the 
        backbone of the program and that they deliver not only 
        nutritious meals to seniors and individuals with disabilities 
        who are at significant risk of hunger and isolation, but also 
        caring concern and attention to their welfare; and
            (4) encourages Members of Congress to support their local 
        senior nutrition programs by participating in their annual 
        March for Meals events and by delivering meals to homebound 
        seniors and serving them in a congregate setting in a community 
        within their district or State throughout the year.
