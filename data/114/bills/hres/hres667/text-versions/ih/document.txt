                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of September as ``National Brain 
                      Aneurysm Awareness Month''.

Whereas an unruptured brain aneurysm can lead to double vision, vision loss, 
        loss of sensation, weakness, loss of balance, uncoordination, and speech 
        problems;
Whereas a brain aneurysm is often discovered when it ruptures and causes a 
        subarachnoid hemorrhage;
Whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to brain damage, hydrocephalus, 
        stroke, and death;
Whereas each year, more than 30,000 people in the United States suffer from 
        ruptured brain aneurysms and 40 percent of these people die as a result;
Whereas annually, between 3,000 and 4,500 people in the United States with 
        ruptured brain aneurysms die before reaching the hospital;
Whereas a number of advancements have been made in recent years regarding the 
        detection of aneurysms, including the computerized tomography (CT) scan, 
        the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test, and the cerebral arteriogram, 
        and early detection can save lives;
Whereas various research studies are currently being conducted in the United 
        States in order to better understand, prevent, and treat brain 
        aneurysms;
Whereas organizations, such as the Brain Aneurysm Foundation, serve as global 
        leaders for brain aneurysm awareness, education, support, advocacy, and 
        research funding; and
Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate month to designate as 
        ``National Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a ``National Brain Aneurysm 
        Awareness Month''; and
            (2) continues to support research to prevent, detect, and 
        treat brain aneurysms.
                                 <all>
