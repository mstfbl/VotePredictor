        thus becoming the 12th Triple Crown winner;
Whereas American Pharoah is a descendant of the 1973 Triple Crown winner, 
        Secretariat;
Whereas American Pharaoh owner Ahmed Zayat was born and raised in Cairo, Egypt, 
        and began horse racing at an early age, competing in show jumping, and 
        winning national titles as a child in the under-12 and under-14 age 
        divisions;
Whereas Ahmed Zayat a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey, is CEO of Zayat Stables, 
        well-known for success in American Thoroughbred horse racing;
Whereas American Pharoah was trained by Bob Baffert, an inductee of the National 
        Museum of Racing's Hall of Fame; and
Whereas jockey Victor Espinoza successfully rode American Pharoah in each of the 
        three legs of the Triple Crown: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates--
            (1) American Pharoah and owner Ahmed Zayat of Teaneck for 
        his achievement of the Triple Crown, as well as his wife, 
        Joanne, and their four children, Ashley, Justin, Benjamin, and
