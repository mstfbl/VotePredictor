                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week.

Whereas multiple sclerosis can impact people of all ages, races and ethnicities, 
        but is more common (at least 2-3 times) in women than men;
Whereas approximately 2,300,000 people worldwide have been diagnosed with 
        multiple sclerosis;
Whereas multiple sclerosis is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, 
        however it is estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and 
        adolescents are living with multiple sclerosis in the United States;
Whereas multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable neurological disease that 
        interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the 
        brain and the rest of the body;
Whereas symptoms of multiple sclerosis range from numbness and tingling to 
        blindness and paralysis and the progress, severity and specific symptoms 
        of multiple sclerosis in any one person cannot yet be predicted;
Whereas there is no laboratory test available that definitely defines a 
        diagnosis for multiple sclerosis;
Whereas multiple sclerosis is not directly inherited, studies show there are 
        genetic and likely environmental factors that indicate certain 
        individuals are more susceptible to the disease, such as Caucasians of 
        northern European ancestry;
Whereas the exact cause of multiple sclerosis is still unknown and there is no 
        cure;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national network of independent 
        multiple sclerosis organizations dedicated to the enhancement of the 
        quality of life for all those affected by multiple sclerosis, recognizes 
        and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition's mission is enhanced cooperation to 
        provide greater opportunities for the effective use and development of 
        resources for the benefit of individuals and families affected by 
        multiple sclerosis;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and supports Multiple 
        Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of every calendar year;
Whereas the United States was a founding member of the international Progressive 
        MS Alliance in 2012, coordinating research to accelerate the development 
        of treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis by removing scientific 
        and technology barriers;
Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are to invite people to 
        join the movement to end multiple sclerosis, encourage everyone to do 
        something to demonstrate their commitment to moving toward a world free 
        of multiple sclerosis, and to acknowledge those who have dedicated their 
        time and talent to help promote multiple sclerosis research and 
        programs; and
Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is recognized during the 
        week of March 2, 2015, through March 8, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
        Awareness Week;
            (2) encourages States, territories, possessions of the 
        United States, and localities to support the goals and ideals 
        of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing proclamations 
        designating Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (3) encourages media organizations to participate in 
        Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week and help provide education to 
        the public about multiple sclerosis;
            (4) commends the efforts of the States, territories, and 
        possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
        ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
        States to ending multiple sclerosis by promoting--
                    (A) awareness about individuals that are affected 
                by multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) education programs, supporting research, and 
                expanding access to medical treatment;
            (6) recognizes all individuals in the United States living 
        with multiple sclerosis;
            (7) expresses gratitude to the family members and friends 
        of individuals living with multiple sclerosis, who are a source 
        of love and encouragement to those individuals; and
            (8) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
        researchers who--
                    (A) provide assistance to those individuals 
                affected by multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) continue to work to find ways to stop the 
                progression of the disease, restore nerve function, and 
                end multiple sclerosis forever.
