     Expressing support for designation of October 2 as ``National 
                          Manufacturing Day''.

Whereas United States manufacturers provide 17,600,000 jobs in the United 
        States;
Whereas manufacturing accounted for 12 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 
        2014;
Whereas including pay and benefits, the annual mean earnings of a United States 
        manufacturing worker is $77,506, almost $15,000 higher than the average 
        wage of all other industries;
Whereas manufacturing continues to be the backbone of the United States Economy, 
        contributing $2,090,000,000,000 to the economy in 2014;
Whereas manufacturers continue to transform the marketplace, performing more 
        than 75 percent of non-government research and development, accounting 
        for more innovation than any other sector;
Whereas United States manufacturing workers' productivity exceeds that of any 
        other manufacturing economy; and
Whereas in the past five 5 years, United States manufacturing has added over 
        700,000 jobs, marking the fastest pace of job growth since the 1990s: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the critical role manufacturing plays in the 
        United States economy creating good paying jobs that help 
        support working families; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``National Manufacturing 
        Day'', which honors the hardworking men and women of the United 
        States manufacturing sector.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
