 Recognizing 2016 as the year of the 100th anniversary of the National 
              Association of Secondary School Principals.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals was founded in 
        1916 to study the problems of school administrators, increase 
        collaboration between secondary school experts and higher education 
        institutions when making requirements, rethink the teacher appointment 
        process, create a better spirit of cooperation, and set certain 
        standards and tests of efficiency for high school subjects;
Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals founded the 
        National Honor Society in 1921 and the National Junior Honor Society in 
        1929 to recognize outstanding high school and middle level students who 
        have demonstrated excellence in the areas of scholarship, leadership, 
        service, character, and citizenship;
Whereas the National Association of Student Councils, which was established in 
        1931 and became a program of the National Association of Secondary 
        School Principals in 1943, promotes leadership, service, student voice, 
        and engagement as essential qualities of middle level and high school 
        student councils to be effective organizations and maintain valuable 
        leadership partnerships between students and their schools;
Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals in conjunction 
        with the National Association of Elementary School Principals 
        established the National Elementary Honor Society in 2008 to recognize 
        elementary students in both public and nonpublic elementary schools for 
        their outstanding academic achievement and demonstrated personal 
        responsibility;
Whereas the National Elementary Honor Society was also established in order to 
        provide meaningful service to the school and community, and to develop 
        essential leadership skills in the students of elementary schools;
Whereas in 2011, the National Association of Secondary School Principals 
        released Breaking Ranks: The Comprehensive Framework for School 
        Improvement, which emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to different 
        school contexts and aims to foster a customized solution unique to each 
        school to improve student achievement; and
Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals is the leading 
        organization of and voice for middle level and high school principals, 
        assistant principals, and school leaders from across the United States 
        and 35 countries around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the National 
        Association of Secondary School Principals;
            (2) commends the National Association of Secondary School 
        Principals for 100 years of dedicated service by connecting and 
        engaging school leaders through advocacy, research, education, 
        and student programs;
            (3) applauds the National Association of Secondary School 
        Principals for promoting the intellectual growth, academic 
        achievement, character and leadership development, and physical 
        well-being of youth by having founded and continuing to 
        administer the National Honor Society, the National Junior 
        Honor Society, the National Elementary Honor Society, and the 
        National Association of Student Councils; and
            (4) acknowledges the commitment of the National Association 
        of Secondary School Principals to continue supporting middle 
        level and high school principals, assistant principals, and 
        school leaders from across the United States and 35 countries 
        around the world by promoting high professional standards, 
        focusing attention on school leaders' challenges, providing a 
        national voice for school leaders, building confidence in 
        public education, and strengthening the role of the principal 
        as an instructional leader for the next 100 years and beyond.
