                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that United States 
law firms should not represent Iran in any judicial proceeding or other 
  capacity to assist efforts of Iran to avoid paying compensation to 
                  victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism.

Whereas Iran has sponsored terrorism, including the 1996 Khobar Towers attacks, 
        the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Lebanon, the 1998 attacks on two 
        United States Embassies in Africa, a 1990 assassination in New York 
        City, and various other attacks;
Whereas the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Lebanon killed 220 Marines of the 
        1st Battalion, 8th Marines based in Camp Lejeune;
Whereas section 502 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 
        2012 allows assets of Iran held in the United States to be available for 
        paying judgments relating to Iran-sponsored terrorism; and
Whereas United States law firms represented Iran in Bank Markazi v. Peterson 
        before the United States Supreme Court thus assisting efforts of Iran to 
        avoid paying compensation to victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
United States law firms should not represent Iran in any judicial 
proceeding or other capacity to assist efforts of Iran to avoid paying 
compensation to victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism.
                                 <all>
