        found Kibbutz Geva, and became involved in the Hanoar Haoved youth 
        movement;
Whereas in 1945, Peres joined the Young Guard of Mapai, the political party that 
        later became the Labor Party, and was elected to the steering committee;
Whereas in 1945, Peres married Sonia Gelman, to whom he was married for more 
        than 60 years until her passing in 2011;
Whereas in 1952, Peres was appointed deputy director general of the Defense

Whereas Peres served in the Golda Meir government in various positions;
Whereas Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin appointed Peres as defense minister in 
        1974;

        the Likud party;
Whereas Peres worked to achieve a peace agreement with the PLO and successfully 
        negotiated the Oslo Accords, which were signed in 1993;
Whereas for his work on the Oslo Accords Peres, along with Yitzhak Rabin and 
        Yasser Arafat was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994;
Whereas upon the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995, Peres assumed 
        the role of Prime Minister and led the country through a difficult
