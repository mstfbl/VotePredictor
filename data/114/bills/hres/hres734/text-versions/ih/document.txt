                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing and honoring the historical significance of the 40th 
anniversary of the Judgment of Paris, and the impact of the California 
 victory at the 1976 Paris Tasting on the world of wine and the United 
                    States wine industry as a whole.

Whereas 40 years ago in Paris, France, a number of leading French wine experts 
        were invited by Wine Merchant Stephen Spurrier to blind taste some of 
        the greatest wines of France and California;
Whereas those prestigious experts chose the 1973 Chateau Montelena Winery Napa 
        Valley Chardonnay by winemaker Miljenko ``Mike'' Grgich as the finest 
        white wine in the tasting;
Whereas those same experts chose the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars S.L.V. Napa 
        Valley Cabernet Sauvignon made by Warren Winiarski as the finest red 
        wine in the tasting;
Whereas the resulting story by journalist George Taber found widespread 
        distribution throughout the press, notably in TIME magazine, as the 
        ``The Shot Heard Round the World'';
Whereas this attention created an immediate, positive impact on the world of 
        wine, and created among experts, consumers and the trade a new and 
        enthusiastic appreciation for California wines;
Whereas wine is now produced in all 50 States and enjoyed at ever increasing 
        levels by consumers throughout the country;
Whereas the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History 
        exhibits the winning bottles in its permanent collections (the 1973 
        Chateau Montelena Winery Chardonnay and the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine 
        Cellars S.L.V. Cabernet Sauvignon), and has included those bottles in 
        their selection of remarkable objects in the book of the Smithsonian's 
        History of America in 101 Objects by Richard Kurin; and
Whereas Napa Valley is now recognized internationally as a vanguard of the 
        United States wine business and contributes more than $162,000,000,000 
        to the Nation's economy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes and honors 
the historical significance of the 40th anniversary of the Judgment of 
Paris, and the impact of the California victory at the 1976 Paris 
Tasting on the world of wine and the United States wine industry as a 
whole.
