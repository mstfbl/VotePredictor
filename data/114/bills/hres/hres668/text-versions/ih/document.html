                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that philanthropy 
 is an integral partner to government with a unique and proven ability 
  to foster innovation, strengthen civil society, and build thriving 
                              communities.

Whereas philanthropy embodies a longstanding United States value of charitable 
        giving and empowers donors from all walks of life to use a variety of 
        giving tools to serve their communities both today and tomorrow;
Whereas charitable giving is driven by United States generosity but also reliant 
        upon the enabling environment fostered by incentives in the tax code;
Whereas foundations spur innovation and drive progress in our communities in 
        education, healthcare, the arts, economic and rural development, and 
        countless other social issues;
Whereas foundations, while not a replacement for government services, leverage 
        private resources and provide vital risk capital and expertise to 
        respond to immediate needs like natural disasters, and build resources 
        over time to address long-term issues like education and job creation;
Whereas philanthropy enriches the Nation's civil society through a deep 
        connection to the needs of communities, and as such, is an essential 
        partner in policymaking; and
Whereas the Nation benefits from collaboration between government and the 
        philanthropic sector, and together, we can work to solve pressing social 
        problems, better serve our common constituents, and produce thriving 
        United States communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
philanthropy is a dynamic force for innovation, strategic thinking, and 
leadership that advances the common good.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
