                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that a grateful Nation honors and 
  salutes Sons and Daughters in Touch on its 25th anniversary that is 
    being celebrated on Father's Day, 2015, at the Vietnam Veterans 
           Memorial in Washington, the District of Columbia.

Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a 
        weekend of remembrance in Washington, the District of Columbia, which 
        will culminate with a Father's Day ceremony at the Vietnam Veterans 
        Memorial;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch is an organization representing an estimated 
        20,000 United States children whose fathers were lost in the Vietnam 
        war;
Whereas before the establishment of Sons and Daughters in Touch in 1990, there 
        was no organization to unite and support those who lost their fathers in 
        Southeast Asia;
Whereas during the anniversary celebration, the United States of America Vietnam 
        War Commemoration will recognize Gold Star ``sons and daughters'' for 
        their service and sacrifice;
Whereas the service and sacrifice of those who died or remain missing as a 
        result of the war in Southeast Asia and the families and children they 
        left behind deserve recognition and honor;
Whereas their fathers served in every branch of the United States Armed Forces, 
        at every rank, and in every battle of the most contentious war in United 
        States history;
Whereas their fathers are now remembered on every panel across the span of the 
        Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, the District of Columbia;
Whereas an unprecedented bond between these Gold Star ``sons and daughters'' and 
        the Nation's Vietnam veterans demonstrates a lasting commitment to honor 
        those who fought in the Vietnam War;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch is committed to furthering the legacy of the 
        Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the establishment of the Education Center 
        at the Wall to be constructed there;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch is to be commended for its resiliency in 
        confronting this painful childhood loss as its works with TAPS and 
        similar organizations to assist America's youngest Gold Star children;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch actively supports the fullest possible 
        accounting for our missing and unaccounted-for servicemen and civilians, 
        and it stands in support of the families seeking answers about their 
        loved ones, as well as efforts of the United States to obtain them;
Whereas the members of Sons and Daughters in Touch are now grown, living in 
        every State, and contributing to the diverse fabric of the United 
        States;
Whereas many of these ``children'' followed their fathers in to military 
        service, often rising to the highest ranks in the United States Armed 
        Forces;
Whereas today, after Gold Star Mothers and American Gold Star Wives, Sons and 
        Daughters in Touch is the oldest Gold Star family organization in the 
        United States;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch continues to fulfill its mission of 
        locating, uniting, and supporting America's Gold Star ``sons and 
        daughters'' from the Vietnam war;
Whereas representatives from all Gold Star families, including from Vietnam, 
        Korea, World War II, and from the United States more recent conflicts, 
        will participate in the 25th anniversary celebration;
Whereas the United States youngest Gold Star children have lost fathers and 
        mothers who served in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and 
        Operation Iraqi Freedom;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch is working with other Gold Star family 
        organizations to set an example, and explain what life holds for the 
        youngest Gold Star children;
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch serves as an example to current and future 
        generations of Gold Star families as they bear the painful burden 
        resulting from selfless sacrifices made by their fathers and mothers in 
        wartime service to the Nation, and Sons and Daughter in Touch serves as 
        an example to all nations affected by war; and
Whereas Sons and Daughters in Touch will celebrate its 25th anniversary, on 
        Father's Day, 2015, at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, the 
        District of Columbia: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors and salutes Sons and Daughters in Touch on its 
        25th anniversary that is being celebrated at the Vietnam 
        Veterans Memorial in Washington, the District of Columbia; and
            (2) expresses gratitude for the service and sacrifice of 
        their fathers who were members of the United States Armed 
        Forces and served in the Vietnam war.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
