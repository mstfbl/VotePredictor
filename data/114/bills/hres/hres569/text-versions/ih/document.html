                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning violence, bigotry, and hateful rhetoric towards Muslims in 
                           the United States.

Whereas the victims of anti-Muslim hate crimes and rhetoric have faced physical, 
        verbal, and emotional abuse because they were Muslim or believed to be 
        Muslim;
Whereas the constitutional right to freedom of religious practice is a cherished 
        United States value and violence or hate speech towards any United 
        States community based on faith is in contravention of the Nation's 
        founding principles;
Whereas there are millions of Muslims in the United States, a community made up 
        of many diverse beliefs and cultures, and both immigrants and native-
        born citizens;
Whereas this Muslim community is recognized as having made innumerable 
        contributions to the cultural and economic fabric and well-being of 
        United States society;
Whereas hateful and intolerant acts against Muslims are contrary to the United 
        States values of acceptance, welcoming, and fellowship with those of all 
        faiths, beliefs, and cultures;
Whereas these acts affect not only the individual victims but also their 
        families, communities, and the entire group whose faith or beliefs were 
        the motivation for the act;
Whereas Muslim women who wear hijabs, headscarves, or other religious articles 
        of clothing have been disproportionately targeted because of their 
        religious clothing, articles, or observances; and
Whereas the rise of hateful and anti-Muslim speech, violence, and cultural 
        ignorance plays into the false narrative spread by terrorist groups of 
        Western hatred of Islam, and can encourage certain individuals to react 
        in extreme and violent ways: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its condolences for the victims of anti-
        Muslim hate crimes;
            (2) steadfastly confirms its dedication to the rights and 
        dignity of all its citizens of all faiths, beliefs, and 
        cultures;
            (3) denounces in the strongest terms the increase of hate 
        speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other 
        hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those 
        perceived to be Muslim;
            (4) recognizes that the United States Muslim community has 
        made countless positive contributions to United States society;
            (5) declares that the civil rights and civil liberties of 
        all United States citizens, including Muslims in the United 
        States, should be protected and preserved;
            (6) urges local and Federal law enforcement authorities to 
        work to prevent hate crimes; and to prosecute to the fullest 
        extent of the law those perpetrators of hate crimes; and
            (7) reaffirms the inalienable right of every citizen to 
        live without fear and intimidation, and to practice their 
        freedom of faith.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
