                               RESOLUTION


 
   Congratulating the National Institute of Nursing Research on the 
                   occasion of its 30th Anniversary.

Whereas the Institute of Medicine in 1983 recommended that nursing research be 
        included in the mainstream of biomedical and behavioral science;
Whereas the Congress established the National Center for Nursing Research within 
        the National Institutes of Health to disseminate information related to 
        basic and clinical nursing research through the passage of the Health 
        Research Extension Act of 1985;
Whereas the National Center for Nursing Research excelled in its purpose to 
        support and provide research training, fellowships, and opportunities 
        for our Nation's nursing scientists;
Whereas the Congress, recognizing the contributions of the National Center for 
        Nursing Research to improving quality care and health, redesignated the 
        center the National Institute of Nursing Research (in this resolution 
        referred to as the ``NINR'') through the passage of the National 
        Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993;
Whereas the NINR's research focus for the past 30 years encompasses advances in 
        health and wellness promotion, managing symptoms of acute and chronic 
        illnesses, as well as innovations in science and practice;
Whereas the NINR's mission is to promote and improve the health of individuals, 
        families, communities, and populations, across all stages of life;
Whereas the NINR's goal is to enhance nursing science and health care by 
        integrating the biological and behavioral sciences, applying new 
        technologies, promoting health equity, and developing scientists of the 
        future;
Whereas NINR funded scientists conduct patient-centered, point-of-care, 
        biobehavioral research with a primary focus on health promotion, symptom 
        management, quality of care, and quality of life;
Whereas the NINR has a commitment to helping eliminate health disparities facing 
        minority, underserved, and disadvantaged populations across the Nation;
Whereas the NINR is the lead institute for palliative and end-of-life care 
        research at the National Institutes of Health; and
Whereas the NINR invests a large portion of its budget to train emerging 
        scientists, ensuring a strong body of nursing knowledge is generated for 
        the health of the Nation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the National Institute of Nursing 
        Research on the occasion of its 30th Anniversary; and
            (2) commends the Institute for its ongoing support of 
        nursing research integral to the health and well-being of 
        Americans.
                                 <all>
