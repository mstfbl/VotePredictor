                               RESOLUTION


 
      Supporting the goals and ideals of Dominican Heritage Month.

Whereas since the initial wave of Dominican migration in the 1960s to the most 
        recent arrivals of today, Dominicans have worked hard to contribute to 
        the national identity of the United States, educating people on their 
        customs and enriching the quality of our shared futures;
Whereas the Dominican Republic enjoys a well-built relationship with the United 
        States on trade and investment flows that have expanded since the 
        Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
        (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on March 1, 2007;
Whereas contributions from Dominican-Americans can be found in every facet of 
        United States life, including baseball stars, such as Hall of Fame 
        inductee Pedro Martinez, United States Secretary of Labor Thomas Edward 
        Perez, and thousands of professionals, soldiers, doctors, lawyers, 
        journalists, educators, and public servants;
Whereas many of our hemisphere's first institutions were established on the 
        shores of the Dominican Republic, including the first cathedral and the 
        oldest university;
Whereas Dominicans are freedom loving people who first began their campaign for 
        their independence in 1831 under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte, 
        who formed a secret political military organization named La Trinitaria 
        (The Trinity) that led to a decisive uprising of a democratic 
        government, resulting in the end of the Haitian occupation and 
        transforming the Dominican Republic into an independent, self-sufficient 
        nation;
Whereas after the long and hard fought campaign for freedom from Haiti, a 
        ceremonial musket shot fired on February 27, 1844, which marked the 
        Dominican Republic's first official Independence Day;
Whereas it is appropriate that the United States reserve the period between 
        January 21 to February 27 to celebrate and honor Dominican heritage;
Whereas it would be befitting to celebrate Dominican heritage beginning on 
        January 21, The Day of the Procession of Altagracia, the Dominican 
        Republic's most important religious celebration;
Whereas it would also be befitting to end the period of Dominican heritage on 
        February 27, the Dominican Republic's Independence Day;
Whereas it would give us the opportunity to acknowledge and applaud the 
        economic, cultural, and social contributions Dominican-Americans have 
        made to the United States; and
Whereas it would also give us an opportunity to consider the many Dominican 
        achievements, on the island and in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Dominican Heritage 
        Month;
            (2) supports the establishment of a national month of 
        Recognition for Dominican-Americans to honor the Dominican 
        people and their contributions; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to observe a 
        national month of recognition for Dominican-Americans with 
        appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
