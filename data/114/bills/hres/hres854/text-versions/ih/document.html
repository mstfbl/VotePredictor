                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting State, local, and community initiatives to encourage 
  parents, teachers, camp counselors, and child-care professionals to 
  take measures to prevent sunburns in the minors they care for, and 
expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that State, local, 
 and community entities should continue to support efforts to curb the 
  incidences of skin cancer beginning with childhood skin protection.

Whereas increasing intermittent sun exposure in childhood and during one's 
        lifetime is associated with an increased risk of squamous cell 
        carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma;
Whereas even one blistering sunburn during childhood or adolescence can nearly 
        double a person's chance of developing melanoma later in life, while 
        five or more blistering sunburns in late adolescence increases one's 
        melanoma risk by 80 percent and nonmelanoma risk by 68 percent;
Whereas despite an excellent safety profile, sunscreen is not allowed in many 
        schools without physician authorization;
Whereas in these cases, sunscreen is usually required to be stored in a locked 
        cabinet in the nurse's office;
Whereas no published studies show that sunscreens that meet FDA standards are 
        toxic to humans or hazardous to human health; and
Whereas research shows that wearing sunscreen can prevent sunburn and reduce the 
        risk of skin cancer and premature aging: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports Federal, State, and local efforts to exempt 
        sunscreen from over-the-counter medication bans in schools and 
        encourages all schools to allow students to possess sunscreen 
        at school without restriction and without requiring physician 
        authorization;
            (2) encourages State, local and community entities, 
        including schools and summer camps, to develop policies that 
        provide for the use of and access to sunscreen and articles of 
        sun protective clothing; and
            (3) supports initiatives and efforts to encourage 
        physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals, 
        through pediatric wellness exams and other opportunities, to 
        educate parents and their children about sun-safe behaviors, 
        including instructions on how to apply sunscreen and 
        effectively wear comprehensive sun-protective clothing.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
