                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of Nowruz.

Whereas Nowruz marks the traditional Iranian New Year, which originated in 
        ancient Persia, and dates back more than 3,000 years;
Whereas Nowruz, meaning a ``New Day'', occurs on the vernal equinox and 
        celebrates the arrival of spring;
Whereas Nowruz symbolizes a time of renewal and community, it harkens the 
        departure from the trials and tribulations of the previous year and 
        brings hope for the New Year;
Whereas Nowruz is celebrated by nearly 300,000,000 Iranians and other peoples 
        all over the world, including in the United States, Iran, and other 
        countries in Central Asia, South Asia, Caucasus, Crimea, and Balkan 
        Regions;
Whereas Nowruz is celebrated by Iranian-Americans of all backgrounds, including 
        those with Baha'i, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Zoroastrian, and 
        nonreligious backgrounds;
Whereas Nowruz serves to remind the United States of the many lasting 
        contributions of the Persian civilization to the world and the 
        noteworthy impact of Iranian-Americans to the social and economic fabric 
        of society in the United States;
Whereas Iranian-Americans continue to make contributions in all sectors of 
        American public life, including as government, military, and law 
        enforcement officials working to uphold the Constitution of the United 
        States and to protect all people in the United States;
Whereas Iranian-Americans maintain strong ties to the people of Iran and desire 
        to see a democratic Iran that respects human rights; and
Whereas Nowruz embodies the tradition that each individual's thinking, speaking, 
        and conduct should always be virtuous, and the ideal of compassion for 
        our fellow human beings regardless of ethnicity or religion, and 
        connects the Persian New Year to the values of human rights: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the cultural and historical significance of 
        Nowruz;
            (2) expresses its appreciation for the contributions of 
        Iranian-Americans to society in the United States in observance 
        of Nowruz;
            (3) recognizes the hopes and aspirations of all people, 
        including the people of Iran for human rights and religious 
        tolerance as embodied in the spirit of Nowruz;
            (4) commends the observance of the Nowruz holiday in both 
        the United States and Iran, and strongly supports the right of 
        all Iranians to exercise freedom of assembly, freedom of 
        expression, and freedom of speech; and
            (5) wishes Iranian-Americans and the people of Iran and all 
        those who observe this holiday a prosperous new year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
