                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Health Week.

Whereas the week of April 6, 2015, through April 12, 2015, is National Public 
        Health Week;
Whereas the theme for National Public Health Week in 2015 is ``Healthiest Nation 
        2030'' with the goal of making the United States the healthiest nation 
        in one generation;
Whereas public health organizations use National Public Health Week to educate 
        the public, policymakers, and public health professionals about issues 
        that are important to improving the health of the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in the air we breathe, the 
        water we drink, the food we eat, and the places where we all live, 
        learn, work, and play;
Whereas there is a 16 percent difference in the health status of people living 
        in the healthiest States compared to people living in the least healthy 
        States;
Whereas public health professionals help communities prevent, prepare for, 
        withstand, and recover from the impact of a full range of health threats 
        including disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and disasters caused by 
        human activity;
Whereas public health professionals collaborate with partners that are not in 
        the health sector, such as city planners, transportation officials, 
        education officials, and private sector businesses, recognizing that 
        other sectors have an important influence on health;
Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite being one of the 
        wealthiest nations in the world, the United States ranks below many 
        other economically prosperous and developing countries with respect to 
        many indicators for healthy life, including life expectancy, infant 
        mortality rates, low birth weight rates, and the rate of drug-related 
        deaths;
Whereas studies show that small strategic investments in prevention can result 
        in significant savings in health care costs;
Whereas each 10 percent increase in local public health spending contributes to 
        a 6.9 percent decrease in infant deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in 
        cardiovascular deaths, a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, 
        and a 1.1 percent decrease in cancer-related deaths;
Whereas in communities across the country, more people are changing the way they 
        care for their health by avoiding tobacco use, eating healthier, 
        becoming more physically active, and preventing unintentional injuries 
        at home and in the workplace;
Whereas despite having an infant mortality rate that is higher than any of its 
        other 27 economically prosperous peer countries, the United States has 
        begun to make progress with the infant mortality rate declining 12 
        percent from 2005 to 2011;
Whereas in 2013, the percentage of adults smoking in the United States decreased 
        from 21.2 percent to 19.6 percent and the percentage of physically 
        inactive adults in the United States decreased from 26.2 percent to 22.9 
        percent; and
Whereas efforts to adequately support public health and prevention can continue 
        to transform a health system focused on treating illness to a health 
        system focused on preventing disease and promoting wellness: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health 
        Week;
            (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, 
        the Federal Government, States, Tribes, municipalities, local 
        communities, and individuals in preventing disease and injury;
            (3) recognizes the role of public health in improving the 
        health of people in the United States;
            (4) encourages increased efforts and resources to improve 
        the health of people in the United States to create the 
        healthiest nation in one generation through--
                    (A) greater opportunities to improve community 
                health and prevent disease and injury; and
                    (B) strengthening of the public health system of 
                the United States; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn 
        about the role of the public health system in improving health 
        in the United States.
                                 <all>
