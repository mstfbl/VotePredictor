        from the Cleveland Marshall School of Law in 1953;

        of the founders of the Stokes, Stokes, Character and Terry law firm;

        and activists;

        including the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio, which defined the legality 
        of police search and seizure procedures;

        House of Representatives, representing the 21st (later the 11th) 
        District of Ohio;
Whereas upon his election, he became the first African-American to represent 
        Ohio;
Whereas he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, an 
        organization comprised of the Black Members of the United States 
        Congress, created to be the voice for people of color and vulnerable 
        communities, and he served as its chair for two terms;
Whereas in 1971, Congressman Stokes was the first African-American to serve on 
        the House Appropriations Committee, and by his retirement in 1998, had

        States of America;

        persons, and he played a pivotal role in the quest for civil rights, 
        equality, and justice;
Whereas his Christian faith was the foundation of his service to others;
Whereas he often expressed gratitude for the sacrifices of his mother--a young 
        widow, former sharecropper, and daughter of slaves--who inspired her 
        sons to get an education so that they would not have to work with their

        the STEM workforce; and

        Congressman Louis Stokes; and
