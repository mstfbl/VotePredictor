   To express support for recognition of June 2016 as National Orca 
                           Protection Month.

Whereas orcas are an icon of the Pacific Northwest;
Whereas orcas are culturally and spiritually important to Indian tribes in the 
        Pacific Northwest;
Whereas the Puget Sound is home to three pods of Southern Resident orcas;
Whereas the Southern Resident orca population has declined dramatically over the 
        past 50 years;
Whereas the Southern Resident orcas are among the most contaminated marine 
        mammals in the world;
Whereas the Southern Resident orcas are threatened by declining chinook salmon 
        populations;
Whereas the Southern Resident orcas have been protected under the Endangered 
        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) since 2005;
Whereas June 2016 has been recognized by the States of Washington and Oregon as 
        Orca Awareness Month; and
Whereas the Federal Government has an obligation to protect and restore the 
        Southern Resident orca population: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports recognition of 
National Orca Protection Month.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
