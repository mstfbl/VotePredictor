                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
  has failed to adequately develop and execute a strategy capable of 
defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and a significant course 
 correction is necessary at this time to ensure the protection of the 
         people of the United States and United States allies.

Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continues to plan and promote 
        attacks against the United States homeland;
Whereas approximately 30,000 people from more than 100 countries have traveled 
        to Syria and Iraq in order to join ISIS and other groups;
Whereas roughly 4,500 individuals from Western countries and more than 250 
        Americans have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria and Iraq;
Whereas there have been more than twice as many ISIS-inspired terror plots 
        against the West in 2015 than in 2014;
Whereas the United States faces the threat of United States citizens being 
        radicalized abroad and returning to the United States to carry out a 
        terrorist attack;
Whereas ISIS has launched waves of attacks throughout the Middle East, North 
        Africa, and South Asia;
Whereas ISIS has further expanded its ability to inspire and direct terrorist 
        attacks against targets in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific 
        region;
Whereas an ISIS-inspired terrorist stabbed two counterterrorism officers near 
        Melbourne, Australia, on September 23, 2014;
Whereas a Canadian citizen inspired by ISIS rammed a car into two soldiers near 
        Montreal, Canada, on October 20, 2014;
Whereas ISIS took responsibility for inspiring a United States citizen to 
        attempt to attack four police officers with a hatchet in New York City 
        on October 23, 2014;
Whereas an Australian citizen, claiming to be acting on behalf of ISIS, took 17 
        hostages in Sydney, Australia, on December 15, 2014;
Whereas the three assailants in the attack on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and 
        Hypercacher Jewish Market in Paris, France, on January 7 to 9, 2015, 
        declared allegiance to ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula;
Whereas a Danish citizen, allegedly inspired by ISIS, killed two civilians and 
        injured five police officers on February 15, 2015;
Whereas radicalized individuals inspired by ISIS attempted to attack a Prophet 
        Muhammad cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, on May 3, 2015;
Whereas ISIS-inspired assailants killed more than 130 people and wounded 369 
        more in Paris, France, on November 14 and 15, 2015; and
Whereas the United States and its allies will continue to be threatened by 
        terrorist attacks until ISIS and its affiliates are completely 
        destroyed: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives collectively believes 
the President has failed to adequately develop and execute a strategy 
capable of defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and a 
significant course correction is necessary at this time to ensure the 
protection of the people of the United States and United States allies.
