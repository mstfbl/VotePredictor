                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
 States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to restore 
            service standards in effect as of July 1, 2012.

Whereas on January 5, 2015, the United States Postal Service has implemented 
        lower ``service standards'' to virtually eliminate overnight delivery of 
        first class mail and periodicals, and further delay most other mail;
Whereas delayed mail negatively impacts businesses, hurts residents, rural 
        communities and the economy, and drives customers away, resulting in 
        lower revenue and worsens the Postal Service's financial situation; and
Whereas robust service standards implemented by the United States Postal Service 
        are essential to providing prompt and timely delivery of all mail: 
        online purchases, local newspapers, newsletters, bill payments, letters, 
        invitations, packages, and medicines: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures 
to restore service standards in effect as of July 1, 2012.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
