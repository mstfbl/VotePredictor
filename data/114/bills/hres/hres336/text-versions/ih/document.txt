                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the need 
  to create a small donor and public finance system for Congressional 
                               elections.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. PROVIDING FOR SMALL DONOR AND PUBLIC FINANCING OF ELECTIONS.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to 
eliminate the undue influence of money in politics--
            (1) Congress should create a small donor and public finance 
        system for Congressional elections, which will ensure that 
        Congress is responsible to voters instead of well-financed 
        special interests; and
            (2) Members of Congress should devote their full time to 
        regular order and governing instead of campaign fundraising.
                                 <all>
