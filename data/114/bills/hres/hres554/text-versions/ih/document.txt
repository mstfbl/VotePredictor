                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ``Computer Science Education Week''.

Whereas Computer Science Education Week highlights the crucial role that 
        computer science plays in transforming our society, enabling innovation 
        and creating economic opportunity;
Whereas computing technology is an integral part of culture and is transforming 
        how people interact with each other and the world around them;
Whereas computer science is transforming industry, creating new fields of 
        commerce, driving innovation in all fields of science, and bolstering 
        productivity in established economic sectors;
Whereas the field of computer science underpins the information technology 
        sector of our economy, which is a significant contributor to United 
        States economic output;
Whereas the information technology sector is uniquely positioned to help with 
        economic recovery through the research and development of new 
        innovations;
Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that in the year 2022, there 
        will be 9.9 million available computer science jobs in the science, 
        technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, and of those jobs, half 
        will be in computing and information technology;
Whereas allowing students to participate in high-quality computer science 
        activities exposes them to the rich opportunities the field offers and 
        provides critical thinking skills that will serve them throughout their 
        lives;
Whereas all students deserve the chance to receive a thorough preparation in 
        computer science, including access to the qualified teachers, 
        technology, and age-appropriate curricula needed to learn computer 
        science at the elementary and secondary levels of education;
Whereas participating in an Hour of Code during Computer Science Education Week 
        can serve to demystify the field of computer science and encourage more 
        students to take up further studies of computer science;
Whereas the field of computer science has significant equity barriers to 
        address, including attracting more participation by women and 
        underrepresented minorities;
Whereas Grace Murray Hopper, one of the first women in the field of computer 
        science, engineered new programming languages and pioneered standards 
        for computer systems, laying the foundation for future advancements in 
        computer science; and
Whereas the week of December 7, in honor of Grace Hopper's birthday, is 
        designated as ``Computer Science Education Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``Computer Science 
        Education Week'';
            (2) encourages schools, educators, parents and policymakers 
        to participate in ``Computer Science Education Week'' by 
        enabling their students to participate in the Hour of Code;
            (3) encourages schools, teachers, researchers, 
        universities, business leaders and policymakers to identify 
        mechanisms for teachers to receive cutting edge professional 
        development to provide sustainable learning experiences in 
        computer science at all educational levels and encourage 
        students to be exposed to computer science concepts; and
            (4) encourages opportunities, including through existing 
        programs, for women and underrepresented minorities to pursue 
        computer science education and careers.
                                 <all>
