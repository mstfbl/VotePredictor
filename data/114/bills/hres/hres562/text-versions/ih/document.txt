Recognizing the 67th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
          Rights and the celebration of ``Human Rights Day''.

Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations 
        67 years ago on December 10, 1948, represents the first comprehensive 
        agreement among nations as to the specific rights and freedoms of all 
        human beings;
Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights upholds the basic principles 
        of liberty and freedom enshrined within the United States Constitution 
        and Bill of Rights;
Whereas human rights awareness is essential to the realization of fundamental 
        freedoms and contributes to promoting equality, preventing conflict and 
        human rights violations, and enhancing participation in democratic 
        processes;
Whereas the Department of State has declared that a central goal of United 
        States foreign policy is the promotion of respect for human rights, as 
        embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
Whereas December 10 of each year is celebrated around the world as ``Human 
        Rights Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 67th anniversary of the Universal 
        Declaration of Human Rights and the celebration of ``Human 
        Rights Day'';
            (2) supports the ideals of human rights and reaffirms the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
            (3) encourages all nations to continue working towards 
        freedom, peace, and security, which can be achieved only 
        through democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of 
        law; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Human Rights Day'' and continue their commitment to upholding 
        freedom, democracy, and human rights across the globe.
                                 <all>
