                               RESOLUTION


 
Reaffirming the role of the House of Representatives in the review and 
   approval or disapproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
                relating to the nuclear program of Iran.

Whereas the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-17; 129 
        Stat. 201) was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama 
        on May 22, 2015;
Whereas the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 gives Congress 60 days to 
        review and approve or disapprove any nuclear deal between the United 
        States, France, the Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, 
        the United Kingdom, and Germany (commonly known as the ``P5+1 
        countries'') and Iran;
Whereas the P5+1 countries reached an agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
        Action, with Iran on July 14, 2015;
Whereas the Department of State sent the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to 
        Congress for review on July 19, 2015;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action on July 20, 2015, one day after Congress 
        received the Plan;
Whereas Congress should have a central role in the approval or disapproval of 
        the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;
Whereas the Obama Administration supported consideration of the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action in the United Nations Security Council 
        before Congress could review it; and
Whereas the vote by the United Nations Security Council violates the spirit of 
        the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 by bypassing congressional 
        review: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms its role in the review and approval or 
        disapproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;
            (2) expresses its firm disapproval of the Obama 
        Administration's taking action through the United Nations 
        Security Council on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
        before Congress has had time to review the agreement;
            (3) is not bound by the action of the United Nations 
        Security Council to approve the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
        Action on July 20, 2015; and
            (4) will determine whether to approve or disapprove the 
        Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action based solely on whether the 
        agreement is in the national security interests of the United 
        States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
