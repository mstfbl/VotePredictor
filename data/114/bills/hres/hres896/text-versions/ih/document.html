                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the significance of the United States relationship with the 
  Republic of Moldova and encouraging United States support for anti-
     corruption efforts and strengthening democratic institutions.

Whereas the United States has enjoyed a bilateral relationship with the Republic 
        of Moldova since the Republic of Moldova's independence in 1991;
Whereas Moldova has been a valued and reliable partner in promoting global 
        security by participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions in 
        Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Sudan, and Georgia;
Whereas since Moldova's independence, the United States has provided financial 
        assistance to support the people of Moldova's efforts to build a 
        prosperous European democracy;
Whereas over the past two and a half decades, the Department of State, United 
        States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Millennium 
        Challenge Corporation (MCC) have furnished over $1,400,000,000 in 
        assistance to Moldova, including $262,000,000 for a 5-year MCC compact 
        for economic development and investment projects in irrigation 
        infrastructure, high-value agricultural production, and road 
        rehabilitation;
Whereas the United States Government supports the democratic aspirations of the 
        people of the Republic of Moldova;
Whereas on the occasion of Moldova's Independence Day on August 27, Secretary of 
        State John Kerry, on behalf of the President and the people of the 
        United States, said on August 25, 2016, that the United States stands 
        ``squarely behind'' Moldovan democratic reform as well as Moldova's 
        ``efforts to strengthen the rule of law and fight corruption'', its 
        ``desire to ensure greater prosperity and security for every citizen,'' 
        and that ``today and in the years to come, we will continue to support 
        the best interests and aspirations of the Moldovan people.'';
Whereas a resurgent and aggressive Russia is pursuing political and economic 
        warfare in the region, seeking to weaken the continent's Eastern front 
        by sowing discord and dissent whenever the opportunity presents itself;
Whereas due in part to its strategic location, Moldova has developed into a 
        legitimate player in the region, becoming increasingly significant as 
        Russia continues to violate borders and meddle in the internal affairs 
        of its neighbors;
Whereas the theft of nearly $1,000,000,000 from 3 major banks in Moldova in 
        2014, much of which consisted of International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
        loans, has exposed corruption at the highest levels of the Government of 
        Moldova;
Whereas as a result of this banking scandal and the widely acknowledged 
        kleptocracy of a number of political leaders, in recent months Moldova 
        has witnessed anti-government protests composed of hundreds of thousands 
        of people demanding snap elections and the government's resignation;
Whereas it has been alleged by credible sources, including former senior 
        Moldovan Government officials cooperating with the United States 
        Government, and other whistleblowers with personal knowledge of the bank 
        heist and organized criminal activity, that members of the current 
        ruling party, including Vice-Chairman of the Moldovan Democratic Party 
        and feared oligarch Vladimir Plahotniuc, participated in the laundering 
        of these funds into Russian banks and off-shore shell companies;
Whereas it is also believed that funds from Russia, including the infamous 
        Magnitsky Affair, from Libya, and from Iraq, were laundered through 
        Moldova as part of criminal schemes orchestrated by Plahotniuc and his 
        accomplices;
Whereas Plahotniuc, who despite holding no elected office is often described as 
        Moldova's ``Puppeteer'', has deep ties to Moscow including Russian 
        officials that are strong supporters of the Moldovan breakaway region of 
        Transnistria;
Whereas it is understood that United States law enforcement agencies have 
        initiated investigations into the missing $1,000,000,000 from the 
        National Bank of Moldova reserves as well as the possible fraudulent use 
        of the United States banking system, with involvement by United States 
        citizens, to launder money; and
Whereas now, more than ever, the United States must show support for the rule of 
        law, economic freedoms, transparency and anti-corruption initiatives in 
        Moldova: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls on the United States Government and the European 
        Union to ensure that free and fair presidential elections are 
        held in Moldova on October 30, 2016;
            (2) encourages the President and the Department of State to 
        restrict assistance designated for Moldova to only justice 
        sector reform, anti-corruption efforts, and strengthening 
        democratic institutions as long as corruption within the 
        government ranks persist;
            (3) urges the Executive Branch agencies that have initiated 
        investigations to pursue all available avenues to determine if 
        the United States banking system, with involvement by United 
        States citizens was used to launder money as part of the 
        Moldovan banking scandal, if United States taxpayer dollars in 
        the form of IMF loans were directed to sanctioned entities; and 
        what if any members of the Government of Moldova, recipients of 
        United States foreign aid, participated in, or benefitted from, 
        the 2014 bank heist, including Vladimir Plahotniuc;
            (4) calls on those Executive Branch agencies to report the 
        results of those investigations to the United States Congress 
        upon completion;
            (5) requests that, if as a result of said investigations, 
        individuals or entities, including Vladimir Plahotniuc, Andrian 
        Candu, the speaker of the Moldovan Parliament, Mihai 
        Poalelungi, the chairman of the Moldovan Supreme Court of 
        Justice; Eduard Harunjen, the acting Moldovan attorney general, 
        Viorel Chetraru, the general director of Moldova's National 
        Anti-Corruption Center, Viorel Morari, the chief of Moldova's 
        Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's office, Vladimir Cebotari, 
        Moldova's Minister of Justice, Alexandru Jizdan, Moldova's 
        Minister of Internal Affairs, Serghei Iaralov, Ion Plesca, the 
        President of Chisinau's Court of Appeal, and Dorin Damir, the 
        President of the Fighting and Entertainment Association of 
        Moldova, are found to have participated in the laundering of 
        funds from entities or governments sanctioned by the United 
        States, that the United States consider imposing sanctions on 
        those individuals and entities to the extent that United States 
        law allows, including the ban of travel to the United States, 
        economic sanctions, and the freezing of assets; and
            (6) establish through legislation, or via the authority 
        given under Presidential Proclamation 7750, a list similar to 
        the one created by the Magnitsky Act for Vladimir Plahotniuc 
        and other government officials if they are found to have been 
        involved in the abovementioned crimes.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
