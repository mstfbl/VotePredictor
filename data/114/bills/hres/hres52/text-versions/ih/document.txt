  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
  democratic Constitution of the Republic of India and United States-
                India relations on India's Republic Day.

Whereas with over 1,200,000,000 people, the Republic of India is the largest 
        democracy in the world;
Whereas on January 26, 1950, India became a Republic and formed a parliamentary 
        democracy through the adoption of a constitution;
Whereas the Constitution of India guarantees universal suffrage for all those 
        over age 18;
Whereas the Constitution of India includes principles found in the Constitution 
        of the United States, including the separation of powers and the 
        creation of an independent Supreme Court;
Whereas members of India's numerous ethnic groups, minorities, and religions 
        including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians all participate in the 
        governance of India;
Whereas the people of the United States and the people of India maintain a 
        shared commitment to building democratic institutions;
Whereas relations between the United States and India have exponentially 
        increased over the past decade, including in areas of defense, global 
        security, poverty alleviation, education, economic growth, and job 
        creation;
Whereas the United States-India relationship is essential to promoting 
        stability, democracy and prosperity in the 21st century;
Whereas successive United States Presidents have worked on a bipartisan basis to 
        strengthen and deepen relations between the United States and India;
Whereas approximately 3,000,000 Indian-Americans reside in the United States and 
        contribute to the economic, cultural, and community strength of the 
        United States; and
Whereas people-to-people ties between the United States and India strengthen the 
        rapidly growing bilateral partnership: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls for the continued strengthening of relations 
        between the United States and the Republic of India;
            (2) recognizes the democratic values shared between the 
        United States and India; and
            (3) believes that together, India and the United States can 
        bring immense benefits to the people of both countries as well 
        as make enormous contributions to addressing global challenges 
        of the 21st century.
