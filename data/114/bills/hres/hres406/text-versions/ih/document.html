                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the progress made and challenges still faced by people 
                  living with albinism in East Africa.

Whereas the United States House of Representatives brought widespread awareness 
        to the plight of people with albinism in East Africa, where many shamans 
        promote the deplorable belief that people with albinism are less than 
        human, and use their body parts as charms in occult rituals, by passing 
        H. Res. 1088 on March 10, 2010;
Whereas widespread awareness and public outcry in recent years has led to 
        improvements in the lives of people living with albinism in East Africa;
Whereas challenges still exist, and our continued support of people with 
        albinism in East Africa is needed;
Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council passed resolution 23/13 on June 
        13, 2013, calling for an end to attacks and discrimination against 
        people with albinism and further urged ``States to adopt specific 
        measures to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of 
        persons with albinism'';
Whereas United Nations reports indicate that many albinos in Tanzania have been 
        murdered since 2000 and their dismembered body parts have been sold for 
        hundreds to thousands of dollars to be used as charms in rituals, many 
        persons with albinism have been attacked resulting in dismemberment, and 
        grave robbers have exhumed graves seeking limbs and bodies of persons 
        with albinism to sell;
Whereas many people with albinism still lack access to medical services 
        especially for skin cancer and vision problems from which they suffer at 
        higher rates than people without albinism; and
Whereas many people with albinism in East Africa remain highly marginalized and 
        consequently have little access to education, skills training, jobs, and 
        entrepreneurship opportunities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the governments of East Africa that have made 
        advances in improving the lives of people with albinism;
            (2) urges that the United States Government should work 
        with the governments of East Africa and non-governmental 
        organizations to address violence against people with albinism;
            (3) calls upon governments in East Africa to continue to 
        work to ensure the right to life, the prohibition of torture 
        and ill-treatment of people with albinism;
            (4) calls upon governments in East Africa to take 
        appropriate measures to prevent attacks by investigating and 
        prosecuting those individuals who kill, assault, persecute, or 
        discriminate against people with albinism to the full extent of 
        law;
            (5) calls upon governments in East Africa to adopt specific 
        measures to promote access to adequate health care, employment, 
        education, and justice for individuals with albinism; and
            (6) calls upon governments in East Africa to work closely 
        together to take measures against human trafficking of people 
        with albinism across state borders.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
