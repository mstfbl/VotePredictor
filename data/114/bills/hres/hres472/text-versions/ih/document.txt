  Expressing support for designation of the week of October 11, 2015, 
          through October 17, 2015, as ``Earth Science Week''.

Whereas this year marks the 18th annual international Earth Science Week, 
        designated by the American Geosciences Institute to help the public gain 
        a better understanding and appreciation for the earth sciences and to 
        encourage stewardship of the Earth;
Whereas the theme for 2015, ``Visualizing Earth Systems'', promotes better 
        public understanding of Earth's natural systems by showing data and 
        observations in an illustrative manner;
Whereas the study of earth sciences leads to an improved understanding of the 
        Earth's natural systems and the interplay between human society and 
        these systems;
Whereas the earth sciences are integral to the discovery, development, and 
        conservation of energy, water, and natural resources and to the safe 
        disposal of waste products;
Whereas the earth sciences provide the basis for mitigating natural hazards such 
        as droughts, earthquakes, floods, coastal erosion, hurricanes, and 
        landslides;
Whereas understanding earth science is essential to the design and safe 
        construction of buildings and infrastructure;
Whereas earth scientists study and interpret the Earth, the ocean, its 
        environment, and life as they have changed through time;
Whereas the earth sciences enhance our understanding of current and past global 
        conditions, and offer a basis for anticipating future conditions;
Whereas the ocean covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface and provides 99 
        percent of the Earth's habitat, more than 50 percent of the United 
        States population is found within coastal counties, and earth scientists 
        working in marine environments contribute to the understanding of our 
        global ocean and river systems enabling advancements in food management, 
        national security, energy resources, transportation, economy, and 
        recreation;
Whereas the earth sciences support our ability to manage healthy and productive 
        soils and ocean and river waters and fisheries, the foundation for our 
        Nation's food supply;
Whereas the earth sciences contribute to our understanding of Earth as a planet 
        in our solar system and the universe;
Whereas earth science research leads to the development of innovative new 
        technologies and industries that fuel the American economy and improve 
        our quality of life;
Whereas earth science researchers and educators drive creativity and passion for 
        the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields 
        among students of all ages through diverse and innovative education and 
        public outreach efforts;
Whereas geological aspects of resources, hazards, and environment are vital to 
        land management and land use decisions at local, State, regional, 
        national, and international levels;
Whereas geoscientists and researchers in our Nation's labs, universities, 
        research institutions, and Federal agencies, including USGS, NASA, NOAA, 
        NPS, NSF, and DOE, continually push the frontiers of human knowledge of 
        the world around us, help develop and incubate the concepts and programs 
        that keep United States companies and industries at the innovative 
        forefront of the world's economy, and inspire future generations of 
        researchers, scientists, and informed citizens; and
Whereas the earth sciences make vital contributions to our understanding of and 
        respect for nature and our home planet: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Earth Science Week'';
            (2) expresses strong support for the goals and ideals of 
        Earth Science Week and its aims to increase understanding of 
        and interest in earth science at the local, State, national, 
        and international levels;
            (3) recognizes the importance of education and public 
        outreach efforts to ensure the United States public gains a 
        better understanding and appreciation for the impact of the 
        earth sciences on their daily lives;
            (4) encourages K-12 students to participate in local, 
        State, and national events in connection with Earth Science 
        Week and to get involved in the celebration by exploring 
        artistic and academic applications of earth science; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Earth Science Week with appropriate activities to gain a better 
        understanding and appreciation for the earth sciences and to 
        encourage stewardship of the Earth.
