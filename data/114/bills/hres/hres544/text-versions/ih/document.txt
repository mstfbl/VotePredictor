                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
  should submit any binding and universal agreement on climate change 
  adopted at the Conference of the Parties (``COP21'') of the United 
   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to the Senate as a 
   treaty under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution.

Whereas the United States is one of 196 countries that are parties to the United 
        Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (``Convention'');
Whereas from November 30 to December 11, 2015, the United States will be 
        participating in the twenty-first session of the Conference of the 
        Parties (``COP21'') of the Convention in Paris, France;
Whereas, according to the organizing committee of COP21, the objective of COP21 
        is to achieve a binding and universal agreement on climate from all 
        countries of the world;
Whereas statements by United States Special Envoy for Climate Change, Todd 
        Stern, and other United States Government officials indicate that 
        President Obama does not intend to submit the agreement that results 
        from COP21 to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification of 
        the agreement; and
Whereas the Constitution clearly states in article II, section 2, clause 2 that 
        the President is empowered to propose and negotiate agreements between 
        the United States and other countries only with the advice and consent 
        of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President should submit any binding and universal agreement on 
climate change adopted at the Conference of the Parties (``COP21'') of 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to the Senate 
as a treaty under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution.
                                 <all>
