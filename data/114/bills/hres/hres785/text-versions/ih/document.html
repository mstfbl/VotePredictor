                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the Boy Scouts of America for its long history of service 
 on the 100th anniversary of the day it was granted a Federal charter.

Whereas the Boy Scouts of America was founded in Washington, DC, on February 8, 
        1910, by Chicago publisher William D. Boyce after the ``Unknown Scout'' 
        aided Mr. Boyce through a dense London fog and refused a tip for the 
        assistance;
Whereas the birth of the Boy Scouts of America was based on the principles of 
        the scout movement founded by famed British retired General Lord Robert 
        Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell;
Whereas legislation establishing the Federal charter of the Boy Scouts of 
        America was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and, 
        on June 15, 1916, was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson, 
        Honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America;
Whereas the passage of the Federal charter established the Boy Scouts of America 
        as the preeminent scout organization for boys and granted it exclusive 
        use of the name ``Boy Scouts of America'';
Whereas the Boy Scouts of America holds a Federal charter alongside other 
        organizations distinguished for their service to the community, such as 
        the American Red Cross, the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, 
        and the American Legion;
Whereas the Boy Scouts of America continues to prepare young people to make 
        ethical and moral choices by teaching them the values of the Scout Oath 
        and Scout Law and continues its mission of ``patriotism, courage, self-
        reliance, and kindred values'' and its goal of providing ``citizenship, 
        service, and leadership'';
Whereas both youth and adult members strive to fulfill the Scout Motto of ``Be 
        Prepared'' and the Scout Slogan of ``Do a Good Turn Daily'';
Whereas today more than 2,400,000 youths and 1,000,000 adult volunteers are 
        active members of the Boy Scouts of America, and since 1910, over 
        110,000,000 people have been members of the Boy Scouts of America;
Whereas the Cub Scouts was founded in 1930 and is a family-oriented program of 
        the Boy Scouts of America that is designed specifically to address the 
        needs of younger boys;
Whereas youth and adult members of the Cub Scouts strive to fulfill the Cub 
        Scout Motto of ``Do Your Best'';
Whereas the Venturing Program, a co-ed program of the Boy Scouts of America, and 
        the Exploring Program, a career-initiative program of the Boy Scouts of 
        America, continue to serve older youth;
Whereas special programs of the Boy Scouts of America, such as Scoutreach, the 
        History Of Scouting Trail, and the High Adventure Bases, bring scouting 
        to inner-city youth, educate people about the important history of the 
        Boy Scout program, and provide outdoor challenges and experiences for 
        Boy Scouts; and
Whereas Boy Scouts, including Eagle Scouts, provide over 28,000,000 hours of 
        community service each year throughout the United States and its 
        territories: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the Boy Scouts of America for over 100 years 
        of promoting community service and leadership development;
            (2) encourages the Boy Scouts of America to continue to 
        emphasize character building, responsible citizenship, and 
        outdoor stewardship;
            (3) applauds the Boy Scouts of America for instilling the 
        values of the Scout Oath and the Scout Law in young Americans; 
        and
            (4) congratulates the Boy Scouts of America on the 100th 
        anniversary of June 15, 1916, the day it was granted a Federal 
        charter.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
