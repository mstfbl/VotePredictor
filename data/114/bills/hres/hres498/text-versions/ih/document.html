                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of October 2015 as ``National Breast 
                       Cancer Awareness Month''.

Whereas breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide;
Whereas 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer 
        in her lifetime;
Whereas breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in 
        the United States;
Whereas each year it is estimated that over 230,000 women in the United States 
        will be diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 40,000 will die;
Whereas an estimated 2,300 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the 
        United States and more than 400 will die each year;
Whereas in recent years, there has been a gradual reduction in female breast 
        cancer incidence rates among women aged 50 and older;
Whereas death rates from breast cancer have been declining since about 1990, due 
        in part to better screening and early detection, increased awareness, 
        and continually improving treatment options; and
Whereas October 2015 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Breast Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Breast Cancer 
        Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals of that month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the month with appropriate awareness and educational 
        activities, and take steps to reduce their risk of breast 
        cancer, including maintaining a healthy weight, exercising, 
        limiting alcohol intake and menopausal hormones, and 
        breastfeeding, if they can.
