        name in 1999 to Family, Career and Community Leaders of America to 
        better reflect the career focus of the skill preparation of its members;
Whereas, as part of career and technical education Family, Career and Community 
        Leaders of America is a tried and true solution to ensure that 
        competitive skilled workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding 
        jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand career fields, such as 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly known as 
        STEM) disciplines, design, hospitality, early childhood education, and 
        many other fields that are vital to keeping the United States 
        competitive in the global economy;
Whereas Family, Career and Community Leaders of America helps the United States 
        meet the very real and immediate challenges of strong families, economic 
        development, student achievement, and global competitiveness;
Whereas over 10,000,000 students have participated in Family, Career and 
        Community Leaders of America over the last 70 years;
Whereas, as a national career and technical student organization that affords 
        students the opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and credentials 
        needed to secure careers in growing, high-demand fields;
Whereas secondary school students participating in Family Career and Community 
        Leaders of America are significantly more likely to report that they had 
        developed skills during high school in problem solving, project 
        completion, research, applying to colleges, work-related contexts, 
        communication, time management, and critical thinking;
Whereas students at schools with highly integrated rigorous academic, career, 
        and technical education programs have significantly higher achievement 
        in reading, mathematics, and science than students at schools with less 
        integrated programs; and
Whereas Family, Career and Community Leaders of America is celebrating its 70th 
        anniversary: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--

        Community Leaders of America;
            (2) recognizes the importance of career and technical 
        education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce in 
        the United States; and
            (3) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to 
        promote career and technical education as an option for 
        students.
