        credibility and honor to the institution of Congress;

Whereas Lewis was imprisoned for 40 days in the Mississippi State Penitentiary

Whereas Lewis was beaten nearly unconscious at the Greyhound bus station in 
        Montgomery, Alabama, for his participation in the Freedom Rides;

        Lifetime Achievement ever granted by the John F. Kennedy Library 
        Foundation;
Whereas Lewis was elected to Congress in 1987, representing the 5th District of 
        Georgia;
Whereas Lewis' courage and leadership has made him one of the strongest and most 
        revered Members of the United States House of Representatives; and
Whereas once in every biennial Congress, Members of the House should gather to 
        reflect on the lifelong service and dedication these men so willingly 
        give to their country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives commemorates 
Representative Sam Johnson and Representative John Lewis for their 
patriotic service and sacrifice to the country they love and for
