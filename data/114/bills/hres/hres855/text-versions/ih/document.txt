                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to remember and 
  honor the members of the United States Armed Forces, veterans, and 
  military families who served in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.

Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, that 
        killed nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, children, and first responders, 
        the United States launched military operations around the world to 
        protect the Nation and its allies from the threat of terrorism;
Whereas 15 years after the attacks, the United States continues to mourn their 
        loss;
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces and our international partners 
        deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq, and locations around the world to 
        undertake combat, security, and stabilization operations in the fight 
        against terrorism;
Whereas in the 15 years since the September 11 attacks, more than 1,000,000 men 
        and women have responded to the Nation's call to duty and volunteered to 
        serve in the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas more than 6,800 members of the United States Armed Forces have made the 
        ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in service to the Nation since 
        September 11, 2001;
Whereas millions of military families have endured countless hardships at home 
        while their spouses, parents, siblings, and children served abroad;
Whereas over 2,900,000 post 9/11 military veterans have returned to civilian 
        life and continue to serve their communities and the Nation;
Whereas due to their service and sacrifice, the Nation is stronger and safer; 
        and
Whereas more than 2,100,000 members of the United States Armed Forces currently 
        serve on active duty, in the Reserves, and in the National Guard, 
        standing ready to defend the United States from attack: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes September 11 as a day of remembrance and 
        extends its deepest sympathies to the victims, families, 
        friends, and loved ones affected by the September 11, 2001, 
        terrorist attacks;
            (2) honors the service and sacrifice of the men and women 
        who served in the United States Armed Forces in the aftermath 
        of September 11 attacks;
            (3) expresses its deepest sorrow for those members of the 
        United States Armed Forces who gave their lives, paying the 
        ultimate price in service to the United States and extends its 
        deepest sympathies to their families;
            (4) extends its gratitude and thanks to the armed forces of 
        all nations who have served and fought alongside the United 
        States Armed Forces since September 11, 2001;
            (5) honors the sacrifices made by military families and 
        recognizes the unwavering and critical support they provide the 
        members of the United States Armed Forces; and
            (6) reaffirms its duty to understand and honor our post-9/
        11 veterans and faithfully serve the needs of all veterans.
                                 <all>
