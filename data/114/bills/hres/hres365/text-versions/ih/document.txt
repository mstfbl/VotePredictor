 Expressing support for dancing as a form of valuable exercise and of 
    artistic expression, and for the designation of July 25, 2015, 
                        ``National Dance Day''.

Whereas Nigel Lythgoe, executive producer and celebrity judge for the dance-
        themed television show ``So You Think You Can Dance'', in association 
        with the Dizzy Feet Foundation, has encouraged the creation of 
        ``National Dance Day'' in nations around the world, beginning with the 
        first ``National Dance Day'' on the National Mall in 2010;
Whereas the Dizzy Feet foundation and the Kennedy Center, in conjunction with 
        the office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will celebrate 
        ``National Dance Day'' on July 25, 2015, in Washington, DC, at the 
        Kennedy Center;
Whereas ``National Dance Day'' has captured the imagination of people throughout 
        the Nation and around the world and has helped popularize dancing as an 
        art, for fun, and as a form of exercise;
Whereas ``National Dance Day'' encourages many forms of dance expression, 
        representing the Nation's rich artistic, regional, ethnic, and racial 
        diversity;
Whereas ``National Dance Day'' features the spectrum of dance, from classical to 
        popular to line and partner dances;
Whereas dancing helps improve heart health, burn calories, strengthen muscles, 
        and improve flexibility for people of all ages;
Whereas health officials have repeatedly documented an overweight and obesity 
        epidemic among every age group in the United States;
Whereas dancing, in all its variations, is a popular form of physical exercise;
Whereas this year at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, performances by 
        Antoine Hunter, AXIS Dance Company, Baakari Wilder, Culture Shock, Evan 
        Ruggiero, and Season 9 finalist of ``So You Think You Can Dance'' Cyrus 
        ``Glitch'' Spencer will entertain and encourage dancing;
Whereas instructional videos are available on the Dizzy Feet Foundation YouTube 
        channel featuring dance routines for all skill levels and ability in 
        advance of National Dance Day to be performed by audiences on National 
        Dance Day; and
Whereas the last Saturday in July continues an appropriate day to celebrate 
        ``National Dance Day'', as it has been for the past 5 years: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Dance Day'' to 
        celebrate and encourage a national commitment to dance, dance 
        education, and physical fitness;
            (2) acknowledges that dance is making an important 
        contribution to health by encouraging physical fitness and 
        reducing overweight and obesity; and
            (3) commends Nigel Lythgoe for his leadership in promoting 
        ``National Dance Day''.
