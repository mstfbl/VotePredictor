                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designating February 2016 as ``National Spine 
                            Ability Month''.

Whereas spinal impairment is the primary cause of disability in the United 
        States, affecting 14,000,000 people in the Nation;
Whereas the United States spends $253,000,000,000 on costs associated with 
        spine-related impairment;
Whereas the cost of spine-related impairment and associated musculoskeletal 
        disorders over the past 20 years has escalated by nearly 4 times the 
        rate of increase as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP);
Whereas 66 percent of the total costs associated with spine related impairment 
        in the United States is attributed to productivity loss and absenteeism, 
        accounting for annual employer losses of $28,000,000,000;
Whereas back pain was the cause of 671,000,000 bed days and 385,000,000 lost 
        work days in 2008;
Whereas spine impairment is currently the leading cause of disability in 
        veterans of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas millions of children suffer from spinal deformities and conditions 
        reducing quality of life and longevity;
Whereas 94 percent of children with spine-related impairment report some level 
        of associated disability;
Whereas the North American Spine Foundation is a non-profit multistakeholder 
        organization that is cohesively and collaboratively addressing the 
        leading cause of disability in the United States, spinal impairment;
Whereas the North American Spine Foundation has established the Spine 10 x 25 
        Initiative with the stated goal of achieving a 10-percent reduction in 
        spine-related disability in the United States by the year 2025; and
Whereas February 2016 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Spine Ability Month'' to raise awareness for spinal impairment and 
        support the goals of the Spine 10 x 25 Initiative: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Spine Ability 
        Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Spine 
        Ability Month'';
            (3) continues to support research to find better 
        prevention, treatments, and support services for spinal 
        impairment; and
            (4) commends organizations like the North American Spine 
        Foundation for its Spine 10 x 25 Initiative to reduce spine-
        related disability by 10 percent in the United States by 2025.
