                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing concern regarding the preventable loss of life associated 
  with sports-related sudden death of student athletes in the United 
States, and emphasizing the importance of rigorous, evidence-based pre-
       participation physical examinations for student athletes.

Whereas a pre-participation examination is an essential component of ensuring 
        safe and healthy sports participation;
Whereas a pre-participation physical examination may be the sole source of 
        medical evaluation for a significant share of American children and 
        adolescents each year;
Whereas pre-participation physical examinations are important to helping student 
        athletes and their parents understand a student athlete's unique 
        individual risks of potential injury or illness related to their 
        participation in athletics;
Whereas medical, practitioner, and scientific professional society 
        recommendations, as well as the recommendations of Federal and State 
        task forces, represent invaluable contributions to the standard of care 
        provided during pre-participation physical examinations;
Whereas scientific research and innovation in healthcare has led to the 
        development of now-widely available tools, including electrocardiogram 
        (EKG), echocardiogram, positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic 
        resonance imaging (MRI), and next-generation genetic sequencing (NGS), 
        and will continue to advance the development of future technologies, 
        designed to diagnose potential medical problems;
Whereas medical professionals, student athletes, and parents of student athletes 
        must act in partnership to carry out a successful pre-participation 
        physical examination, including sharing concerns and appropriately 
        weighing individualized risk factors;
Whereas local school districts, youth sports associations, and college and 
        university athletic departments have a responsibility to educate student 
        athletes, parents of student athletes, or both such athletes and parents 
        about sports-related health risks, raise awareness about student athlete 
        health, and develop responsible policies and recommendations to 
        encourage healthy sports participation;
Whereas an estimated 120 student athletes passed away during sports-related 
        activities in 2014, and the risk of sudden death for student athletes is 
        estimated at one out of 200,000 per year, though several recent studies 
        indicate that the actual figure may be significantly higher; and
Whereas each and every student athlete's death from a preventable cause during 
        an organized athletic practice or competition is a tragedy with severe 
        emotional, physical, and financial consequences for families, schools, 
        and communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives encourages local school 
districts, youth sports associations, and college and university 
athletic departments to regularly update their pre-participation 
physical examination policies, in accordance with evidence-based best 
practices and with respect for special parental considerations, in the 
following areas--
            (1) medical and family history surveys;
            (2) physical examination practices;
            (3) cardiovascular screenings;
            (4) neurologic screenings;
            (5) orthopaedic screenings;
            (6) general medical screenings;
            (7) medication and supplement use surveys;
            (8) nutritional and dietary assessments;
            (9) heat and hydration-related illness risk assessments;
            (10) mental health considerations;
            (11) the administration of pre-participation physical 
        examinations;
            (12) the referral of cases for further evaluation and 
        intervention; and
            (13) the determination of clearance for, or exclusion from, 
        sports participation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
