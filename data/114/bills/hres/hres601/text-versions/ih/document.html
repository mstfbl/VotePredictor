   Recognizing the 146th anniversary of the ratification of the 15th 
          amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Whereas February 3, 2016, is the 146th anniversary of the ratification of the 
        15th amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas the 15th amendment prohibits the government from denying a citizen the 
        right to vote based on race; and
Whereas it is important to continue to ensure the ability of all United States 
        citizens to participate fully in the electoral process: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 146th anniversary of the ratification of 
        the 15th amendment to the Constitution of the United States; 
        and
            (2) acknowledges the significance of the 15th amendment and 
        continues to support its goals and ideals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
