                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the 250th anniversary of the founding of Rutgers, the State 
                       University of New Jersey.

Whereas, on November 10, 1766, the Royal Governor of New Jersey, William 
        Franklin, granted a charter in the name of King George III for the 
        establishment of Queen's College;
Whereas, in 1825, Queen's College was renamed Rutgers in honor of Colonel Henry 
        Rutgers, a University trustee and Revolutionary War veteran;
Whereas, in 1864, Rutgers was designated as a land-grant college, offering 
        educational access to a wide range of students who would become the new 
        workforce for our Nation's expanding businesses, factories, and farms;
Whereas, in 1869, Rutgers became the birthplace of college football by hosting a 
        game against its rival, Princeton University, which Rutgers won 6 to 4;
Whereas, in 1946, the University of Newark became part of Rutgers, laying the 
        foundation for Rutgers University-Newark;
Whereas, in 1950, the College of South Jersey became part of Rutgers, giving 
        rise to Rutgers University-Camden;
Whereas, in 1945 and 1956, the New Jersey State legislature designated Rutgers 
        as the State University of New Jersey;
Whereas, in 1989, Rutgers became a member of the Association of American 
        Universities, an association of the top research universities in the 
        United States and Canada;
Whereas, in 2013, with the integration of most of the University of Medicine and 
        Dentistry of New Jersey into Rutgers School of Biomedical and Health 
        Sciences, Rutgers undertook the largest merger in the history of higher 
        education in the United States;
Whereas, in 2014, Rutgers joined the Big Ten Conference, bringing the long 
        history of collegiate athletics at Rutgers into the storied conference 
        comprised of highly regarded, research-intensive flagship universities;
Whereas, in 2014, Rutgers joined the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, the 
        Nation's premier consortium of top-tier research institutions;
Whereas Rutgers educates more than 65,000 students at 31 schools, employs more 
        than 22,000 faculty and staff, and records more than 1,700,000 patient 
        visits annually;
Whereas Rutgers has more than 460,000 living alumni worldwide;
Whereas celebration of this major milestone began on November 10, 2015, with 
        Charter Day festivities on the lawn of Old Queens (the university's 
        oldest building) and will continue through its 250th anniversary on 
        November 10, 2016;
Whereas Rutgers is the only university in the United States that is a colonial 
        college, a land-grant college, and a comprehensive public research 
        university; and
Whereas Rutgers exemplifies all of the traditions of American higher education: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives honors Rutgers, the 
State University of New Jersey, as it celebrates 250 years of rich 
history as a colonial college, a land-grant institution, and a great 
State university that has been a source of pride for New Jersey and the 
people of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
