    Recognizing the importance of the United States-Israel economic 
         relationship and encouraging new areas of cooperation.

Whereas the deep bond between the United States and Israel is exemplified by its 
        many facets, including the robust economic and commercial relationship;
Whereas, on April 22, 2015, the United States celebrated the 30th anniversary of 
        its free trade agreement with Israel, which was the first free trade 
        agreement entered into by the United States;
Whereas the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement established the Joint 
        Committee to facilitate the agreement and collaborate on efforts to 
        increase bilateral cooperation and investment;
Whereas since the signing of this agreement, two-way trade has multiplied 
        tenfold to over $40,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas Israel is the third largest importer of United States goods in the 
        Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region after Saudi Arabia and the 
        United Arab Emirates despite representing only 2 percent of the region's 
        population;
Whereas nearly half of all investment into the United States from the MENA 
        region comes from Israel;
Whereas Israel has more companies listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange than any 
        other country except for the United States and China;
Whereas in 1956, the United States-Israel Education Foundation was established 
        to administer the Fulbright Program in Israel, and has facilitated the 
        exchange of nearly 3,300 students between the United States and Israel 
        since its inception;
Whereas in 1972, the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) 
        was established to promote scientific relations between the United 
        States and Israel by supporting collaborative research projects in basic 
        and applied scientific fields, and has generated investments of over 
        $480,000,000 to over 4,000 projects since its inception. Binational 
        Science Foundation grant recipients have included 43 Nobel Laureates, 19 
        winners of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Award, and 38 recipients 
        of the Wolf Prize;
Whereas in 1977, the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and 
        Development Foundation (BIRD) was established to stimulate, promote and 
        support non-defense industrial research and development of mutual 
        benefit to both countries in agriculture, communications, life sciences, 
        electronics, electro-optics, energy, healthcare information technology, 
        homeland security, software, water and other technologies, and has 
        provided over $300,000,000 to over 700 joint projects since its 
        inception;
Whereas recent successful BIRD projects include the ReWalk system that helps 
        paraplegics walk, a medical teaching simulator for Laparoscopic 
        Hysterectomies and a new drug to treat chronic gout;
Whereas in 1978, the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and 
        Development Fund was established as a competitive funding program for 
        mutually beneficial, mission-oriented, strategic and applied research of 
        agricultural problems conducted jointly by American and Israeli 
        scientists, and has provided over $250,000,000 to over 1,000 projects 
        since its inception;
Whereas an independent review of the United States-Israel Binational 
        Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD) estimated that the 
        dollar benefits of just 10 of its projects through 2010 came to 
        $440,000,000 in the United States and $300,000,000 in Israel, far 
        exceeding total investment in the program;
Whereas in 1984, the United States and Israel began convening the Joint Economic 
        Development Group (JEDG) to regularly discuss economic conditions and 
        identify new opportunities for collaboration;
Whereas in 1994, the United States-Israel Science and Technology Foundation 
        (USISTF) was established to promote the advancement of science and 
        technology for mutual economic benefit and has developed joint research 
        and development programs that reach 12 States;
Whereas the United States-Israel Innovation Index (USI3), which was developed by 
        USISTF to track and benchmark innovation relationships, ranks the United 
        States-Israel innovation relationship as top-tier;
Whereas in 2007, the United States-Israel Binational Industrial Research and 
        Development Foundation (BIRD) Energy program was established to provide 
        support for joint United States-Israel research and development of 
        renewable energy and energy efficiency, and has provided $18,000,000 to 
        20 joint projects since its founding;
Whereas since 2011, the United States Department of Energy and the Israeli 
        Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources have 
        led an annual United States-Israel Energy Meeting with participants 
        across government agencies to facilitate bilateral cooperation in that 
        sector;
Whereas in 2012, the United States Congress passed and President Barack Obama 
        signed into law the United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012, which set United States policy to expand bilateral 
        cooperation across the spectrum of civilian sectors including high 
        technology, agriculture, medicine, health, pharmaceuticals, and energy;
Whereas in 2013, President Barack Obama said in reference to Israel's 
        contribution to the global economy, ``That innovation is just as 
        important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as 
        our security cooperation.'';
Whereas in 2014, United States Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew said, ``As 
        one of the most technologically-advanced and innovative economies in the 
        world, Israel is an important economic partner to the United States.'';
Whereas the 2014 Global Venture Capital Confidence Survey ranked the United 
        States and Israel as the two countries with the highest levels of 
        investor confidence in the world;
Whereas in 2014, the United States Congress passed and President Obama signed 
        into law the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014, 
        which deepened cooperation on energy, water, agriculture, trade and 
        defense, and expressed the sense of Congress that Israel is a major 
        strategic partner of the United States; and
Whereas economic cooperation between the United States and Israel has also 
        thrived at the state and local levels through both formal agreements and 
        bilateral organizations in over 30 States that have encouraged new forms 
        of cooperation in fields such as water conservation, cybersecurity, and 
        alternative energy and farming technologies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) affirms that the United States-Israel economic 
        partnership has achieved great tangible and intangible benefits 
        to both countries and is a foundational component of the strong 
        alliance;
            (2) recognizes that science and technology innovation 
        present promising new frontiers for United States-Israel 
        economic cooperation, particularly in light of widespread 
        drought, cybersecurity attacks, and other major challenges 
        impacting the United States;
            (3) encourages the Administration to regularize and expand 
        existing forums of economic dialogue with Israel and foster 
        both public and private sector participation; and
            (4) expresses support for the Administration to explore new 
        agreements with Israel, including in the fields of energy, 
        water, agriculture, medicine, neurotechnology and 
        cybersecurity.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
