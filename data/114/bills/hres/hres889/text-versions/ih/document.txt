                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of October as National Domestic 
   Violence Awareness Month and expressing the sense of the House of 
  Representatives that Congress should continue to raise awareness of 
domestic violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic violence 
                         in the United States.

Whereas domestic violence affects people of all ages as well as racial, ethnic, 
        gender, economic, and religious backgrounds;
Whereas females are disproportionately victims as one in four women will 
        experience domestic violence at some point in her life;
Whereas on average, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or 
        boyfriends in the United States every day;
Whereas women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates, per capita, of 
        intimate partner violence;
Whereas about 1 in 5 women who ever experience rape, physical violence, and/or 
        stalking by an intimate partner, first experienced some form of partner 
        violence between 11 and 17 years of age;
Whereas nearly 1 in 3 college women say they have been in an abusive dating 
        relationship;
Whereas 1 out of 3 Native American women will be raped and 6 out of 10 will be 
        physically assaulted in their lifetimes;
Whereas the cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $5,800,000,000 each year, 
        $4,100,000 of which is for direct medical and mental health care 
        services;
Whereas of females killed with a firearm, almost two-thirds were killed by their 
        intimate partners;
Whereas one-quarter to one-half of domestic violence victims report that they 
        have lost a job due, at least in part, to domestic violence;
Whereas some landlords deny housing to victims of domestic violence who have 
        protection orders or evict victims of domestic violence for seeking help 
        after a domestic violence incident, such as by calling 911, or who have 
        other indications that they are domestic violence victims;
Whereas 92 percent of homeless women experience severe physical or sexual abuse 
        at some point in their lifetimes;
Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by a current or former male partner 
        are also physically abused by that partner;
Whereas 98 percent of abusive relationships include financial abuse, causing the 
        survivors to stay or return to the abusive relationship;
Whereas more than 8,000,000 days of paid work each day is lost due to domestic 
        violence issues;
Whereas 96 percent of employed domestic violence victims experience problems at 
        work due to abuse;
Whereas 1 in 15 children are exposed to intimate partner violence each year and 
        90 percent of these children are eyewitnesses to violence;
Whereas at least 10,000,000 children are exposed to domestic violence each year;
Whereas children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to attempt 
        suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, and become a 
        victim of human trafficking;
Whereas one large study found that men exposed to physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
        and adult domestic violence as children were almost four times more 
        likely than other men to have perpetrated domestic violence as adults;
Whereas nearly 1,500,000 high school students nationwide experienced physical 
        abuse from a dating partner;
Whereas 13 percent of teenage girls who have been in a relationship report being 
        hit or hurt by their partners;
Whereas adolescent girls who reported dating violence were 60 percent more 
        likely to report one or more suicide attempts in the past year;
Whereas there is a need for middle schools, secondary schools, and post-
        secondary schools to educate students about the issues of domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking;
Whereas a recently released multi-State study shows that the Nation's domestic 
        violence shelters are addressing victims' urgent and long-term needs and 
        are helping victims protect themselves and their children;
Whereas a 2015 National Census Survey reported that 71,828 violence victims were 
        served by domestic violence shelters and programs around the Nation in a 
        single day;
Whereas an additional 12,197 people requested help that day, but due to lack of 
        resources, they were unable to be served;
Whereas there is a need to increase funding for programs aimed at intervening 
        and preventing domestic violence in the United States;
Whereas domestic shelters and programs experience increased demands for service, 
        80 percent report cuts in funding; and
Whereas individuals and organizations that are dedicated to preventing and 
        ending domestic violence should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic 
        Violence Awareness Month; and
            (2) expresses the sense of the House of Representatives 
        that Congress should continue to raise awareness of domestic 
        violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
        and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic 
        violence in the United States.
