  Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to preclude the 
 Committee on Rules from reporting a rule or order that would provide

Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:

would provide less than 10 hours of debate (inclusive of debates on 
amendments). Any such rule or order shall also provide that if a motion 
to limit debate is offered, such a motion may only take effect if there 
is an affirmative vote of two-thirds of those voting, a quorum being 
present.''.
