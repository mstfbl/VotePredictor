                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the designation of the week beginning November 14, 2016, as 
                   ``National Apprenticeship Week''.

Whereas a highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in the global economy 
        and to support economic growth;
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system established by the Act of 
        August 16, 1937, (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly known as the 
        ``National Apprenticeship Act'') (referred to in this preamble as the 
        ``national registered apprenticeship system''), which has existed for 
        over 75 years--

    (1) is an important pathway for workers of the United States;

    (2) offers a combination of academic and technical instruction paid, 
on-the-job, training;

    (3) provides workers of the United States credentials that are 
nationally recognized and industry-recognized;

    (4) leads to higher earnings for apprentices; and

    (5) develops a highly skilled workforce for the United States;

Whereas registered apprenticeships--

    (1) are becoming increasingly innovative and diverse in design, 
partnerships, timeframes, and use of emerging educational and training 
concepts; and

    (2) will continue to evolve to meet emerging skill essentials and 
employer requirements and maintain high standards for apprentices;

Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system provides education and 
        training for apprentices in--

    (1) high-growth sectors, including information technology, financial 
services, advanced manufacturing, and health care; and

    (2) traditional industries;

Whereas according to the Department of Labor, the national registered 
        apprenticeship system leverages approximately $1,000,000,000 in private 
        investment, which reflects the strong commitment of the sponsors of the 
        national registered apprenticeship system;
Whereas an evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs in 10 States 
        conducted by Mathematica Policy Research in 2012 found that--

    (1) individuals who completed registered apprenticeship programs earned 
over $300,000 more over their careers than individuals who did not 
participate in registered apprenticeship programs;

    (2) the estimated social benefits of each registered apprenticeship 
program (including additional productivity of apprentices and the reduction 
in governmental expenditures as a result of reduced use of unemployment 
compensation and public assistance) exceeded the costs of each registered 
apprenticeship program by more than $49,000; and

    (3) the tax return on every dollar the Federal Government invested in 
registered apprenticeship programs was $27; and

Whereas the celebration of National Apprenticeship Week--

    (1) honors industries that use the registered apprenticeship model;

    (2) encourages expansion of the registered apprenticeship model to 
prepare highly skilled workers of the United States;

    (3) recognizes the role the national registered apprenticeship system 
has played in preparing workers of the United States for jobs; and

    (4) promotes conversation about ways the national registered 
apprenticeship system can continue to respond to workforce challenges in 
the 21st century: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Apprenticeship 
        Week'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of apprenticeships in 
        developing a well-trained and highly skilled workforce; and
            (3) commends organizations and employers that actively 
        support apprenticeship programs.
                                 <all>
