                               RESOLUTION


 
   Honoring in praise and remembrance the wonderful achievements in 
  academic, athletic and humanitarian distinction of Quincy Williams.

Whereas, on December 3, 2014, 17-year-old Quincy Williams passed away, unable to 
        survive fatal injuries resulting from an automobile accident;
Whereas, Mr. Williams was born February 22, 1997, in Houston, Texas;
Whereas, he remained a native of Houston, Texas;
Whereas, Mr. Williams was a talented young man who was well revered as a beacon 
        of light by his peers;
Whereas, Mr. Williams was affectionately called by his parents a ``Junior'', and 
        was one of the most outgoing, lovable kids that a parent could ever 
        want;
Whereas, his family, the love and strength of Mr. Williams, is very proud of his 
        achievements and commitment to his high school career;
Whereas, he was one of the world's best comedians, and had the ability to make 
        anyone who came into contact with him laugh;
Whereas, his love and compassion was infectious and contagious to all that came 
        into contact with him;
Whereas, although young in body, Mr. Williams was old in song, as he was a 
        profound lover of any and all Motown Performers and would listen to them 
        regularly;
Whereas, Mr. Williams's passion was to play football and run track, and while at 
        Andy DeKaney High School he became branded as the ``Soul Brother'' of 
        his football team;
Whereas, all who knew Mr. Williams admired his prowess for presentation, deeming 
        him one of the ``sharpest'' brothers you'd meet;
Whereas, his family and many admirers genuinely celebrate Mr. Williams's life 
        and outstanding contributions;
Whereas, Mr. Williams cultivated his efforts, positioning himself to 
        successfully matriculate in May of 2016; and, but for his ill-fated 
        passing, would by all accounts have celebrated his well-deserved 
        accomplishments with his family as a milestone achievement in his young 
        life;
Whereas, there is no doubt Mr. Williams would have realized countless ambitions, 
        his family and friends are left to accept that his dreams of 
        immeasurable magnitude now rest with him;
Whereas, this young man worked hard for his successes and accomplishments, and 
        one cannot think of a more solemn manner of celebrating his life than to 
        honor his efforts by recognizing the triumphs for which he so 
        passionately sought and achieved; and
Whereas, the Williams family should be thanked for their dedication in raising 
        their son and his contributions to the future of this Nation: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives does hereby honor in 
        praise, on behalf of the Williams family, Quincy Gemal Williams 
        as a graduate of the Andy DeKaney High School of the Spring 
        Independent School District in Houston, Texas; and
            (2) the House of Representatives does hereby honor in 
        remembrance the wonderful achievements in academic, athletic 
        and humanitarian distinction of Quincy Gemal Williams on behalf 
        of his loving family, dedicated teammates, loyal friends and 
        inspired community.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
