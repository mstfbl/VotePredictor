                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives condemning the 
   recent terrorist attacks in Paris that resulted in the deaths of 
seventeen innocent persons and offering condolences to those personally 
                     affected by this cowardly act.

Whereas, on January 7, 2015, armed radical Islamist terrorists stormed the 
        offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered twelve 
        people, including editorial staff of the paper, a visitor, a security 
        guard, a maintenance worker, and a Muslim police officer;
Whereas terrorists Cherif and Said Kouachi, who carried out the attack, were 
        located and killed by police two days later and their hostages rescued;
Whereas Amedy Coulibaly killed a female police officer on January 8, 2015, and 
        intentionally targeted a kosher supermarket, taking multiple hostages 
        and murdering four Jewish men on January 9, 2015, before French police 
        raided the store, killed Coulibaly, and rescued the surviving hostages;
Whereas Amedy Coulibaly stated that he had worked in coordination with Said and 
        Cherif Kouachi and called them ``brothers from our team'';
Whereas Hayat Boumeddiene, a fourth suspect connected with the attack and the 
        common-law wife of Amedy Coulibaly, remains at large;
Whereas the Kouachi brothers are believed to have traveled to Yemen in 2011 
        where they are reported to have received weapons training and met with 
        Anwar al-Awlaki, a senior member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula;
Whereas al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed credit for the Charlie Hebdo 
        attack;
Whereas Amedy Coulibaly claimed to be a member of the Islamic State of Iraq and 
        Syria;
Whereas radical Islamist terrorist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq 
        and the Levant, al-Qaeda and its affiliates worldwide, the Taliban and 
        Haqqani network in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Ansar al-Sharia in Libya, 
        Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizballah in Lebanon and 
        Syria, Hamas in Gaza, and others, pose a growing threat to international 
        peace and stability;
Whereas these terrorist attacks represent an assault on fundamental principles 
        essential to a democratic society, including the universal right to free 
        expression and freedom of religion;
Whereas the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in France and throughout Europe 
        remains of great concern;
Whereas the United States and France share a longstanding cultural, political, 
        and economic relationship that has greatly benefitted both nations;
Whereas since the founding of our Nation, France has been an ally of the United 
        States, and French soldiers have fought side-by-side with American 
        soldiers throughout history, including during two World Wars;
Whereas security cooperation between the United States and France plays an 
        essential role in combating violent extremism in West and North Africa, 
        the Middle East and around the world; and
Whereas the United States is committed to supporting its oldest ally France in 
        this difficult time: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the recent terrorist attacks in Paris that 
        resulted in the tragic loss of seventeen innocent lives;
            (2) extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by 
        this tragedy;
            (3) supports the efforts of the Government of France to 
        ensure that all of those individuals who committed or supported 
        these attacks are brought to justice;
            (4) remains concerned regarding the flow of foreign 
        fighters to and from the Middle East and West and North Africa 
        and the threat posed by these individuals upon their return to 
        their local communities;
            (5) appreciates and supports France's continuing efforts to 
        combat terrorism and promote stability throughout the Middle 
        East and West and North Africa;
            (6) appreciates France's contributions to the multilateral 
        effort to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant;
            (7) recognizes the growing threat posed by radical Islamist 
        terrorist groups worldwide and reaffirms the commitment of the 
        United States to the multilateral, global fight against such 
        violent extremists;
            (8) calls upon all nations to join a global effort to 
        combat violent extremist ideologies and terrorist groups; and
            (9) remains committed to the defense of free expression, 
        including religious freedom, as well as other universal values 
        that terrorists seek to destroy through a campaign of cowardly 
        threats and reprehensible violence.
