                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the House of Representative in respect to 
promoting a strong national energy policy that supports the innovative 
and hard-working men and women in the oil and gas industry who have led 
            the charge in a United States energy revolution.

Whereas the United States is blessed by an abundance of natural resources and 
        strong entrepreneurial, creative, and industrious spirit;
Whereas pioneering techniques such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic 
        fracturing have sparked an unprecedented boom in oilfields in Texas, 
        Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Ohio, Colorado, and across the country;
Whereas the United States has become a global leader in both oil and natural gas 
        exploration due solely to the tireless and innovative efforts of every 
        wildcatter, roustabout, roughneck, driller, derrickman, toolpusher, 
        landman, company man, and many more;
Whereas the economic impact of the boom created by the technological advances is 
        felt throughout communities and industries outside of the oilfield 
        through job creation and increased market demand;
Whereas the oil and natural gas industry has continued to be a bright spot 
        supporting thousands of jobs in a sluggish economy strapped by 
        burdensome regulatory overreach and antiquated policies of bygone eras;
Whereas the United States depends on their exhaustive hours and dangerous work 
        to power homes, pave roads, fuel cars, farm lands, and everything that 
        keeps the Nation running;
Whereas the United States depends on their exhaustive hours and dangerous work 
        to increase our energy independence, bolster national security, create 
        jobs, and promote economic growth; and
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes that the United States energy 
        policies must be as adaptive and innovative as the hard-working men and 
        women in the oil patch: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports policies 
that--
            (1) cut through bureaucratic red tape to encourage domestic 
        energy resurgence;
            (2) reduce harmful, job-killing regulations; and
            (3) eliminate an obsolete, decades-old crude oil export ban 
        to reduce price volatility, increase market stability, and 
        promote economic growth.
                                 <all>
