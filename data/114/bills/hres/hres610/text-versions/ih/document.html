                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Black History Month and honoring the 
     outstanding contributions of African-American Medal of Honor 
                              recipients.

Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest award for personal acts of valor in 
        action above the call of duty against an enemy force which can be 
        bestowed upon an individual serving in the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas since its first presentation in 1863, 3,496 members of the United States 
        Armed Forces have received the Medal of Honor with just less than half 
        being awarded for actions during the Civil War;
Whereas African-American servicemembers have played vital roles in military 
        operations throughout the history of the Nation;
Whereas 88 African-Americans have been awarded the Medal of Honor for military 
        valor;
Whereas William Harvey Carney, a member of the 54th Massachusetts Colored 
        Infantry's C Company and the first African-American to earn the Medal of 
        Honor after he risked his own life to save the American flag and return 
        it from the front lines of battle, despite being wounded several times 
        as Confederate troops charged;
Whereas William Harvey Carney was not presented with the Medal of Honor until 
        nearly 37 years after his acts of bravery;
Whereas in 1993, a study commissioned by the United States Army described 
        systematic racial discrimination in the criteria for awarding medals 
        during World War II;
Whereas after an exhaustive review, the study recommended seven African-American 
        World War II veterans be awarded the Medal of Honor; and
Whereas African-American men and women who today serve in the United States 
        Armed Forces play a critical role in the defense and security of the 
        Nation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes Black History Month as an important time to 
        acknowledge and reflect on the significant contributions of 
        African-Americans in the Nation's history; and
            (2) honors the outstanding contributions of African-
        American servicemembers, including the 88 African-Americans who 
        have been awarded the Medal of Honor for military bravery, 
        heroism, and valor.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
