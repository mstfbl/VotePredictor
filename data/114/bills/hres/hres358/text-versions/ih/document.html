                               RESOLUTION


 
   Welcoming the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Committee's inscription of the San 
   Antonio Missions to the World Heritage list, recognizing the San 
     Antonio Missions as having universal historical and cultural 
 significance, and congratulating the people of San Antonio for their 
         years of hard work to make this designation a reality.

Whereas, on July 7, 2015, the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations 
        Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) inscribed the 
        San Antonio Missions as a World Heritage site at the 39th Session of the 
        World Heritage Convention in Bonn, Germany;
Whereas San Antonio's 18th century Spanish colonial missions, Mission Espada, 
        Mission San Juan, Mission San Jose, Mission Concepcion, and Mission San 
        Antonio de Valero (the Alamo), are a unique concentration of structures 
        representative of the Spanish colonial influence in the United States;
Whereas the San Antonio Missions World Heritage site includes over 80 
        structures, including a historical ranch (Rancho de las Cabras), 
        granaries, acquilas, and churches;
Whereas the city of San Antonio developed around the Missions, and Mission 
        Espada, Mission San Juan, Mission San Jose, and Mission Concepcion are 
        active Catholic parishes with regular services;
Whereas the San Antonio Missions are a historical and cultural treasure not only 
        for San Antonio and Texas, but for the entire country;
Whereas the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park was established in 
        1978 and began operation in 1983;
Whereas the World Heritage Committee designates places around the world for 
        recognition as having outstanding historical, artistic, scientific, or 
        natural value;
Whereas the United States proposed the World Heritage concept to the 
        international community, and became the first country to sign the United 
        Nations World Heritage Treaty in 1973 when the United States Senate 
        ratified the treaty by a vote of 95-0;
Whereas the World Heritage list includes 1,031 sites globally, including the 
        Egyptian Pyramids, the Great Wall of China, and Australia's Great 
        Barrier Reef;
Whereas the San Antonio Missions are the first World Heritage sites in Texas and 
        the 23rd in the United States, which includes the Statue of Liberty, the 
        Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone National Park;
Whereas a diverse group of local entities supported the San Antonio Mission's 
        designation for years, including the San Antonio Conservation Society, 
        the Archdiocese of San Antonio, the San Antonio River Authority, the 
        National Parks Conservation Association, Los Compadres de San Antonio 
        Missions, Bexar County, the city of San Antonio, and the National Parks 
        Service;
Whereas designation as a World Heritage site fills the people of Texas with 
        pride, and will be a tremendous benefit to the local San Antonio 
        economy;
Whereas an economic impact study on the designation estimated a 10-year impact 
        of $44,000,000 to over $100,000,000 in additional economic activity, and 
        more than 1,000 additional jobs; and
Whereas the city of San Antonio and entire State of Texas embrace and cherish 
        this designation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives welcomes the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
World Heritage Committee's inscription of the San Antonio Missions to 
the World Heritage list, recognizes the San Antonio Missions as having 
universal historical and cultural significance, and congratulates the 
people of San Antonio for their years of hard work to make this 
designation a reality.
