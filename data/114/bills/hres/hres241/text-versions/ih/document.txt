                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing support for designation of April 2015 as ``Alcohol 
     Responsibility Month'' and supporting the goals and ideals of 
                responsible decisions regarding alcohol.

Whereas in 2013, an estimated 10,076 people were killed in the United States in 
        drunk driving crashes involving a driver with a BAC of .08 or greater, 
        impacting countless family members, friends, and communities;
Whereas in 2013, one person died in a drunk driving crash on average every 52 
        minutes;
Whereas in 2013, about 8,700,000 Americans between the ages of 12 to 20, nearly 
        23 percent of the age group for whom alcohol consumption is illegal, 
        reported consuming alcohol in the past 30 days;
Whereas research shows that a lifetime of conversations between parents and 
        their children about alcohol, beginning at an early age, can help 
        prevent underage drinking and alcohol abuse;
Whereas the potential danger for young people to be involved in alcohol-related 
        crashes escalates during prom and graduation season;
Whereas many State attorneys general are launching underage drinking prevention 
        messages and programs in their States and communities; and
Whereas April has been dedicated to alcohol awareness for the last 28 years and 
        more than awareness is needed to further reduce drunk driving and 
        underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Alcohol Responsibility 
        Month'' and supports the goals and ideals of responsible 
        decisions regarding alcohol;
            (2) encourages parents to be responsible role models and to 
        have ongoing conversations about the dangers of alcohol abuse 
        throughout their children's childhood, adolescence, and into 
        adulthood;
            (3) condemns the pervasiveness of alcohol-impaired driving 
        and tragedy; and
            (4) promotes the responsible consumption of alcohol by 
        adults in the United States.
