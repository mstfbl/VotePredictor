                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the life and legacy of Henrietta Lacks in honor of Women's 
                             History Month.

Whereas Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman born on August 1, 1920, in 
        Roanoke, Virginia, was raised by her grandfather on a tobacco farm in 
        Clover, Virginia;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks married David ``Day'' Lacks in 1941 in Halifax County, 
        Virginia, and later moved to the Baltimore County, Maryland community of 
        Turner Station, to build a life for themselves and their five children: 
        Lawrence, Elsie, David, Deborah and Joseph (Zakariyya);
Whereas in 1951 Henrietta Lacks at the age of 31 was diagnosed with cervical 
        cancer, and despite receiving painful radium treatments, passed away on 
        October 4, 1951;
Whereas medical researchers took samples of Henrietta Lacks' tumor during her 
        treatment and the HeLa cell line from her tumor proved remarkably 
        resilient;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks died eight months after her cancer diagnosis, leaving 
        behind her children, husband and her ``immortal cells'' that would 
        change the world;
Whereas HeLa cells were the first immortal line of human cells, doubling every 
        24 hours, dividing and replenishing indefinitely in a laboratory, and 
        successfully growing outside of the human body for longer than 36 hours;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks' cells were unique, growing by the millions, 
        commercialized and distributed worldwide to researchers, resulting in 
        advances in medicine;
Whereas the advances made possible by Henrietta Lacks' cells and the revenues 
        they generated were not known to her family for more than twenty years;
Whereas an estimated 50,000,000 metric tons of HeLa cells have been distributed 
        around the world to become the subject of more than 74,000 studies;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks' prolific cells continue to grow and contribute to 
        remarkable advances in medicine, including the development of the polio 
        vaccine, as well as drugs for treating the effects of cancer, HIV/AIDS, 
        hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson's disease;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks' cells have been used in research that has contributed 
        to our understanding of the effects of radiation and zero gravity on 
        human cells;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks' immortal cells have informed research on chromosomal 
        conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks' legacy has been recognized around the world through 
        memorials, conferences, museum exhibitions, libraries, print and visual 
        media;
Whereas Henrietta Lacks and her family's experience is fundamental to modern 
        bioethics policies and informed consent laws that benefit patients 
        nationwide by building patient trust and protecting research 
        participants;
Whereas the Lacks family entered a groundbreaking, HeLa Genome Data Use 
        Agreement in 2013 with the medical, scientific, and bioethics 
        communities, giving them a role in regulating the HeLa genome sequences 
        and discoveries;
Whereas Women's History Month is celebrated in March to pay tribute to the many 
        contributions women have made to the United States experience; and
Whereas Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells have made a significant 
        contribution to global health, scientific research, quality of life, and 
        patient rights: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives during Women's History 
month--
            (1) celebrates the life of Henrietta Lacks, an African-
        American woman who unknowingly changed the face of medical 
        science, contributing to lasting, worldwide improvements in 
        health;
            (2) honors Henrietta Lacks as a hero of modern medicine for 
        her contributions to the medical discoveries resulting from her 
        HeLa cells, which helped make possible some of the most 
        important medical advances of the last century; and
            (3) recognizes Henrietta Lacks' legacy, which has 
        contributed to developments in bioethics and patient rights 
        that benefit all people in the United States.
                                 <all>
