                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 25th anniversary of Ukraine's act of declaration of 
                  independence from the Soviet Union.

Whereas, on August 24, 1991, the people of Ukraine proclaimed they would no 
        longer be subject to Soviet rule, inspiring the world with their call 
        for democracy and the rule of law;
Whereas the democratically elected Ukraine Parliament declared independence and 
        the creation of an independent and democratic state, reflecting the 
        desire of the people of Ukraine for freedom and sovereignty following 
        years of communist oppression;
Whereas Ukraine, a nation of more than 45,000,000 people, has its own distinct 
        linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions;
Whereas in 1997, Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        signed a declaration to complement the Charter on a Distinctive 
        Partnership, solidifying relations between NATO and Ukraine, greatly 
        contributing to regional and Euro-Atlantic security;
Whereas Ukraine continues its cooperation with NATO and the European Union in 
        order to expedite its entry in those international organizations and 
        integrate into the international community of democratic states;
Whereas in 2004, in the aftermath of unfair and fraudulent election results, the 
        Ukraine people showed their ability to resolve political differences 
        through nonviolent protest by engaging in peaceful demonstrations;
Whereas in 2013, thousands of people gathered on Independence Square in 
        Ukraine's capital, as well as in other parts of the country, to demand 
        change from the corrupt regime of the Yanukovych Administration;
Whereas since the abdication of President Yanukovych, the new administration has 
        reflected the will of its people by strengthening rule of law, 
        modernizing government agencies and legislature, and reforming private 
        sectors;
Whereas in 2014, the Russian Federation forcibly and illegally occupied the 
        Ukraine territory of Crimea, and invaded regions of eastern Ukraine, in 
        gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, deserving condemnation from 
        the international community;
Whereas over 1,000,000 Ukrainian-Americans in the United States work tirelessly 
        towards establishing closer ties between the two nations; and
Whereas the United States Congress has consistently demonstrated strong 
        bipartisan support for an independent, democratic Ukraine: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) observes and congratulates the people of Ukraine on the 
        25th anniversary of Ukraine's independence;
            (2) commends the democratic reforms that have been 
        accomplished and efforts that still must be made; and
            (3) reaffirms the United States commitment to Ukraine's 
        independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
