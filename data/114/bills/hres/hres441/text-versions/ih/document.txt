                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 25, 2015

                         the Committee on Rules

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Amending the Rules of the House of Representatives to require Members 
   to post on their official public websites information on official 
 travel taken by the Member for which reimbursement was provided by a 
                            private source.

Whereas the public deserves access to information on travel taken by Members of 
        the House of Representatives when reimbursement for the travel is 
        provided by an outside source;
Whereas accessible information on public websites will promote transparency 
        between Congress and the public; and
Whereas improving the public's ability to easily gather this information allows 
        the public to better hold Members of Congress accountable: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved,

SECTION 1. REQUIRING MEMBERS TO POST INFORMATION ON REIMBURSED OFFICIAL 
              TRAVEL ON MEMBER WEBSITES.

        Commissioner who took the travel (or, in the case of travel 
        taken by an employee, the Member, Delegate, or Resident 
        Commissioner under whose direct supervision the employee 
        works), who shall then post on the official public website of

        description of the travel, including the names of the 
        individuals who took the travel, the entity that paid for the

        together with a hyperlink to the information with respect to

            (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)
