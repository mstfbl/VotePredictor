                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the commitment of the House of Representatives to work to 
 combat the nationwide problem of invasive species threatening native 
                              ecosystems.

Whereas approximately 50,000 nonnative invasive animal and plant species have 
        been introduced to the United States, resulting in economic costs 
        estimated at more than $100,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas ports in the northeast were the center of international shipping trade 
        and immigration during our Nation's founding and the earliest known 
        record of invasive species in the United States dates back to 1794;
Whereas all 50 States and the United States territories have at least some form 
        of invasive plants and animals;
Whereas invasive species pose a serious threat to native animal and plant 
        communities and may result in extinctions of native species;
Whereas invasive species cause significant disruptions to natural ecosystems as 
        native and nonnative species compete for limited resources, reduce 
        biodiversity, and alter terrestrial or aquatic habitats;
Whereas invasive species can cause damage that spans an enormous range of 
        effects, including: power outages; loss of farmland property value; 
        contamination of grain; spread of human and other diseases; increased 
        operating costs; loss of irrigation water; collapse of buildings; 
        competition with native plants; loss of sport, game, or endangered 
        species; and ecosystem disturbance;
Whereas there exists three major pathways for habitat invasion, including: 
        transportation corridors such as seaways, railroads and highways; 
        intentionally imported nonnative pets, landscaping plants, aquaculture; 
        and nonnative organisms deliberately released for propagation in the 
        wild;
Whereas there is an urgent need for funding to prevent and preempt the 
        introduction and spread of invasive species from key points of entry, 
        and a focus on stopping them at their sources of entry; and
Whereas numerous Federal agencies, operating under a patchwork of laws, 
        regulations, policies, and programs, are tasked with monitoring and 
        controlling the spread of invasive species yet gaps in authorities or 
        shortages of personnel have hampered efforts to limit the entrance of 
        and damage from invasive species: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives commits to working 
constructively to create a comprehensive solution to the threat of 
invasive species throughout the United States by controlling and 
eradicating established invasive species populations, and preventing 
the further introduction, intentional or unintentionally, of nonnative 
species into native ecosystems.
