                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that India should 
     be a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

Whereas there are currently 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security 
        Council;
Whereas India is the second most populous country in the world with over 
        1,200,000,000 citizens;
Whereas the Republic of India is the world's largest democracy;
Whereas India has the third largest standing army in the world and has 
        demonstrated a strong commitment to promoting regional and global peace 
        by providing tens of thousands of troops to United Nations-mandated 
        peacekeeping missions;
Whereas India has been elected 7 times as a nonpermanent member of the United 
        Nations Security Council, and, in 2010, a majority of the United Nations 
        General Assembly elected the Republic of India to be the Asian 
        representative to the United Nations Security Council;
Whereas the United States-India relationship is an essential partnership 
        supporting global economic and strategic policies; and
Whereas in 2010 and in 2015 President Barack Obama expressed support for a 
        reformed United Nations Security Council and India's entry as a 
        permanent member: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports India's inclusion as a permanent member of the 
        United Nations Security Council; and
            (2) supports the Obama administration's continued work with 
        members of the United Nations to effect India's entry as a 
        permanent member of the Security Council.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
