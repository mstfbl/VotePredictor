purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and to consider in the House, 
without intervention of any point of order, a single motion offered by the chair 
of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the 
Senate amendments. The Senate amendments and the motion shall be considered as 
read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The
