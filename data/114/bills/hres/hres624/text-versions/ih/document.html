                               RESOLUTION


 
 Directing the Committee on the Budget to hold a public hearing on the 
 President's fiscal year 2017 budget request with the Director of the 
             Office of Management and Budget as a witness.

Whereas the Committee on the Budget has held a hearing on the President's budget 
        request every year for 40 years;
Whereas the Committee on the Budget has postponed the markup of the fiscal year 
        2017 Republican budget resolution; and
Whereas the Committee on the Budget has ample time to hold a hearing on the 
        President's fiscal year 2017 budget request: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
Representatives shall hold a public hearing on the President's fiscal 
year 2017 budget request with the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget as a witness.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
