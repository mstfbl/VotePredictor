        development and training programs to build cruise industry knowledge;
Whereas cruise travel professionals deliver value to consumers by providing

Whereas 70 percent of United States cruisers use a cruise travel professional to

        businesses and generated $46,000,000,000 in gross outputs due to 
        spending of cruise lines and their crew and passengers, including 
        indirect economic impacts in 2014; and
