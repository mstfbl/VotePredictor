                               RESOLUTION


 
Celebrating 135 years of diplomatic relations between the United States 
                              and Romania.

Whereas the United States marks the significance of 135 years of diplomatic 
        relations with Romania and congratulates Romania on its achievements as 
        a stable and vibrant democracy and their commitment to being a 
        responsible member of the international community;
Whereas the United States and Romania established diplomatic relations in 1880, 
        and the two countries have since been united by shared values and a 
        strong commitment to freedom and prosperity;
Whereas in the past 25 years Romania has made momentous strides towards 
        promoting stability, security, and democratic principles throughout 
        Central and Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, and the Black Sea 
        region;
Whereas Romania continues to be a responsible member of the international 
        community evident by their efforts to combat global terrorism in 
        Afghanistan and Iraq, and their active pursuit of solutions on a host of 
        global and regional challenges such as Euro-Atlantic defense and energy 
        security;
Whereas Romania's substantial commitment to a North Atlantic alliance and their 
        role as a key North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally are evident 
        through the Aegis Ashore site in Devesulu, which serves as an importance 
        milestone for missile defense for both Europe, the United States, and 
        its allies and through the Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base which functions 
        as a hub for United States Armed Forces abroad and is a key participant 
        in military training exercises held by NATO;
Whereas the strong partnership that exists between the two countries, reaffirmed 
        by the 2011 Joint Declaration on Strategic Partnership for the 21st 
        century, has promoted transatlantic and regional security, free market 
        opportunities, and will continue to foster trade and investment 
        opportunities, tourism, and economic and cultural exchanges; and
Whereas the Romanian-American community has played a prominent role in creating 
        a strong and lasting relationship between the two countries and 
        continues to be committed to the further expansion and consolidation of 
        relations between the United States and Romania: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates 135 years of diplomatic relations between 
        the United States and Romania;
            (2) congratulates Romania for their accomplishments as a 
        great nation; and
            (3) expresses appreciation for Romania's unwavering support 
        and friendship.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
