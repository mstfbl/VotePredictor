 Congratulating the Chicago Blackhawks on winning the 2015 Stanley Cup 
                             Championship.

Whereas the historic Chicago Blackhawks, as one of the National Hockey League's 
        ``Original Six'', have made countless contributions to sports;
Whereas the Blackhawks and the National Hockey League have demonstrated a 
        commitment to promoting fitness and leadership skills for youth through 
        support for youth hockey programs and community skating facilities;
Whereas the Blackhawks have demonstrated a commitment to the Nation's veterans 
        and wounded warriors through their support of sled-hockey rehabilitation 
        programs and unique on-ice opportunities;
Whereas the Blackhawks, the entire hockey community, and the City of Chicago 
        united to support the Reif family in their time of need;
Whereas the Blackhawks have earned the honor of Stanley Cup Champions three 
        times in the past six years, thus establishing a modern-day dynasty;
Whereas Blackhawks players Patrick Kane, Patrick Sharp, Jonathan Toews, Marian 
        Hossa, Duncan Keith, Brent Seabrook, and Corey Crawford led all three 
        championship teams, and in so doing, built a family of teammates;
Whereas with more than 280 straight home game sellouts, the Blackhawks are the 
        pride of their hometown of Chicago, Illinois;
Whereas the Blackhawks organization composed of owner Rocky Wirtz, Head Coach 
        Joel Quenneville, President John McDonough, Executive Vice President Jay 
        Blunk, Vice President and General Manager Stan Bowman, and Senior 
        Advisor of Hockey Operations Scotty Bowman have ensured the legacy of 
        the City of Chicago as a hockey town for the 21st century;
Whereas the Blackhawks, through their amazing offense, superb defense, and 
        unmatched goaltending, dominated the regular season and won 48 games and 
        scored 220 goals against their opponents;
Whereas the Blackhawks defeated the Nashville Predators in 6 games, the 
        Minnesota Wild in 4 games, and the Anaheim Ducks in a very intense 7-
        game series to become the Western Conference Champions and advance to 
        the Stanley Cup Final series;
Whereas in the Stanley Cup Final series, the Blackhawks overcame the aggressive 
        play and young talent of the Eastern Conference Champion Tampa Bay 
        Lightning to win the Stanley Cup Championship in an exciting 6-game 
        series; and
Whereas the innumerable contributions from every player, coach, and the entire 
        Blackhawks family have brought the madness back to Madison Street and 
        Lord Stanley's Cup back to where it belongs, sweet home Chicago, 
        Illinois: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the Chicago Blackhawks for their long 
        distinguished history, countless contributions to sports, and 
        their many successes as a franchise;
            (2) congratulates the Blackhawks on an amazing season and 
        for winning the 2015 Stanley Cup Championship;
            (3) recognizes the players, coaches, and leadership of the 
        Blackhawks organization; and
            (4) joins with all people in the United States and hockey 
        fans all over the world in celebrating the return of the 
        Stanley Cup to Chicago, Illinois.
