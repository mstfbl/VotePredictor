    Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take 
from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1314) to amend the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 to provide for a right to an administrative appeal relating to adverse 
determinations of tax-exempt status of certain organizations, with the Senate 
amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention of any 
point of order, a motion offered by the Majority Leader or his designee that the 
House concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment printed in part A of the 
report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution modified by the 
amendment printed in part B of that report. The Senate amendment and the motion 
shall be considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally 
divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their 
respective designees. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on 
the motion to its adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of 
the question.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
