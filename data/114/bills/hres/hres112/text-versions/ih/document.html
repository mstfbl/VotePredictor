                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of the Secondary School Student 
                       Athletes' Bill of Rights.

Whereas over 7,790,000 student athletes participated in secondary school 
        athletics during the 2013 to 2014 academic year;
Whereas it is estimated that in 2013, over 1.24 million children aged 19 and 
        under visited emergency rooms for injuries sustained as a result of 
        participation in 14 of the most commonly played sports, including 
        football, boys' and girls' soccer, girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' 
        basketball, wrestling, baseball, and softball;
Whereas every 3 minutes, a child is treated in an emergency department for a 
        sports-related concussion, accounting for more than 8 percent of all 
        sports-related emergency cases;
Whereas the number of sports-related concussion injuries has doubled in the last 
        15 years among student athletes aged 8 to 19, despite an overall 
        decrease in the number of students participating in sports;
Whereas sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death for youth 
        participating in sports or exercising, with upwards of 80 percent of 
        those suffering from SCA being asymptomatic prior to cardiac arrest;
Whereas instances of heat-related illness have more than doubled since 1997 and 
        affect high school football players at an average rate that is 10 times 
        higher than that of participants in other sports;
Whereas secondary school student athletes with access to certified athletic 
        health care professionals have lower overall injury rates, lower 
        recurrent injury rates, and lower concussion rates than student athletes 
        without access to certified athletic health care professionals;
Whereas in light of the increase in athletic-related injuries to student 
        athletes, schools are encouraged to develop and adopt best practices and 
        standards to prevent and address student athlete injury;
Whereas the Secondary School Student Athletes' Bill of Rights sets forth that 
        secondary school student athletes have the right to--

    (1) be coached by individuals who are well-trained in sport-specific 
safety and to be monitored by athletic health care team members;

    (2) quality, regular pre-participation examinations and each athlete 
has the right to participate under a comprehensive concussion management 
plan;

    (3) participate in sporting activities on safe, clean playing surfaces, 
in both indoor and outdoor facilities;

    (4) utilize equipment and uniforms that are safe, fitted appropriately, 
and routinely maintained, and to appropriate personnel trained in proper 
removal of equipment in case of injury;

    (5) participate safely in all environmental conditions where play 
follows approved guidelines and medical policies and procedures, with a 
hydration plan in place;

    (6) a safe playing environment with venue-specific emergency action 
plans that are coordinated by the athletic health care team and regularly 
rehearsed with local emergency personnel;

    (7) privacy of health information and proper referral for medical, 
psychosocial, and nutritional counseling;

    (8) participate in a culture that finds ``playing through pain'' 
unacceptable unless there has been a medical assessment;

    (9) immediate, on-site injury assessments with decisions made by 
qualified sports medicine professionals; and

    (10) along with their parents, the latest information about the 
benefits and potential risks of participation in competitive sports, 
including access to statistics on fatalities and catastrophic injuries to 
youth athletes; and

Whereas the Secondary School Student Athletes' Bill of Rights, which sets forth 
        goals and ideals to improve the health, well-being, and athletic 
        experience of secondary school students, can serve as a valuable 
        resource to reduce injury, promote athlete safety, and encourage well-
        being: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support for the principles and values set 
        forth in the Secondary School Student Athletes' Bill of Rights;
            (2) recognizes the importance of proper safety measures, 
        timely medical assessments, and appropriate environmental 
        conditions in ensuring the health and well-being of secondary 
        school student athletes;
            (3) recognizes the role that teachers, parents, coaches, 
        and athletic health care team members play in ensuring the 
        safety and well-being of secondary school student athletes;
            (4) expresses support for secondary schools that have 
        successfully implemented programs, policies, and practices to 
        emphasize and encourage student athlete safety and well-being; 
        and
            (5) encourages secondary schools to continue to take all 
        available and reasonable efforts to ensure student athlete 
        safety.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
