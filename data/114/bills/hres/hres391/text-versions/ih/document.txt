  Expressing support for designation of August 22, 2015, as national 
``Chuck Brown Day'' and honoring his contributions to music and to the 
                         District of Columbia.

Whereas Chuck Brown, who was born on August 22, 1936, and passed away on May 16, 
        2012, at the age of 75, was a District of Columbia resident most of his 
        life;
Whereas Chuck Brown, who taught himself to play guitar, became a virtuoso 
        singer, songwriter, guitarist, and band leader;
Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go beat gave the District of Columbia a musical 
        identity of its own and reminds the Nation that Washington, DC, has 
        always been the hometown of talented artists such as Duke Ellington and 
        Marvin Gaye;
Whereas Chuck Brown's musical catalogue spans 22 studio albums over 3 decades;
Whereas Chuck Brown's hit ``Bustin' Loose'' with his group the Soul Searchers 
        was the top song on the Billboard Top 100 R&B Chart for 4 weeks in 1979;
Whereas Chuck Brown earned a Grammy nomination in 2010 for the song ``Love'', 
        from his album entitled ``We Got This'', and was awarded a National 
        Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2005;
Whereas Chuck Brown's go-go has been passed from generation to generation with 
        undiminished popularity;
Whereas Chuck Brown has influenced jazz, rap, and go-go musicians such as the 
        bands Trouble Funk, Rare Essence, and Experience Unlimited (also known 
        as E.U.);
Whereas Chuck Brown was so committed to securing statehood and equal voting 
        rights for the residents of the District of Columbia that he played a 
        concert on a very hot, humid day on the Capitol grounds in 2010;
Whereas the District of Columbia has named a street near the Howard Theatre and 
        a park in Northeast DC for Chuck Brown;
Whereas Chuck Brown is admired for having risen from humble beginnings and 
        overcoming time in prison to become a devoted father and family man;
Whereas Chuck Brown was a great, multi-talented musician who brought joy through 
        his music, never stopping until his death; and
Whereas August 22, 2015, is Chuck Brown's birthday and would be an appropriate 
        date to designate as ``Chuck Brown Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Chuck Brown Day'', and honors Chuck Brown's 
contributions to music and to the District of Columbia.
