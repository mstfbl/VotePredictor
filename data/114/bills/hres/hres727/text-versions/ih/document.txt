                               RESOLUTION


 
     Supporting the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.

Whereas the economic competitiveness and the national security of the United 
        States are integrally tied with the security of its information systems;
Whereas intrusions at private companies have resulted in the loss of personally 
        sensitive information, the exfiltration of valuable intellectual 
        property, and the destruction of computer systems;
Whereas intrusions in Federal networks have resulted in a loss of privacy for 
        millions of Americans and exposed confidential information to malicious 
        actors;
Whereas networks associated with our critical infrastructure have been probed 
        for possibly exploitable weaknesses;
Whereas these systems, public and private, continue to remain vulnerable to 
        attack by criminals, nation states, and terrorists;
Whereas securing these systems requires sustained partnerships between the 
        Government, industry, and security researchers;
Whereas as a new domain, cybersecurity policy requires innovative thinking from 
        across disciplines in order to be effective;
Whereas past cybersecurity commissions such as the CSIS Commission on 
        Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency have provided valuable input and 
        policy recommendations to Government officials;
Whereas Executive Order 13718 of February 9, 2016, established the Commission on 
        Enhancing National Cybersecurity (the ``Commission'');
Whereas the Commission membership shall draw on expertise from a wide variety of 
        topics relevant to cybersecurity policy;
Whereas the Commission shall evaluate ways to improve awareness and adoption of 
        cybersecurity risk management and other best practices across the 
        information system ecosystem;
Whereas the Commission shall make detailed recommendations on how to strengthen 
        cybersecurity of public and private networks over the next decade; and
Whereas the Commission has the potential to guide the Government to implement 
        policies that enhance privacy, ensure public safety, and protect 
        economic and national security: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly supports the purposes and goals of the 
        Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity;
            (2) will work closely with the Commission to identify bold 
        new approaches needed to enable a thriving, secure, and 
        reliable United States digital economy; and
            (3) will recommend members for appointment to the 
        Commission to participate in shaping its important work.
                                 <all>
