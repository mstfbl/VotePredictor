                               RESOLUTION


 
            Condemning and censuring President Barack Obama.

Whereas upon entering the execution of the Office of President of the United 
        States, President Barack Obama affirmed his constitutional oath as 
        follows: ``I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office 
        of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, 
        preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States'';
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to faithfully execute the Office of 
        the President of the United States and has failed to preserve, protect, 
        and defend the Constitution of the United States;
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to fulfill his duty in article II, 
        section 2 of the Constitution of the United States that he ``shall be 
        Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the 
        Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of 
        the United States'';
Whereas President Obama has willfully failed to follow the counsel and expert 
        advice provided by United States military and intelligence advisors by 
        prematurely withdrawing troops from Iraq, thus leading to further 
        destabilization of the Middle East and increased threats to national and 
        global security;
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to fulfill his duty in article II, 
        section 3 of the Constitution of the United States that he ``shall take 
        Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'';
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to ensure a strong national defense 
        beginning on January 20, 2009, through the present, thus endangering the 
        national security of the United States and its citizens both home and 
        abroad;
Whereas the foreign policy of President Barack Obama has led to increased global 
        instability, jeopardizing national securities;
Whereas the dereliction of duty and miscalculations of President Barack Obama 
        have allowed the combined terrorist organizations of the world to 
        control more land, and increase membership, armament, and resources more 
        than during any other time in history;
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to instruct the Department of Justice 
        to take action to end the practices of certain State and local 
        governments that refuse to abide by standing immigration laws;
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to reinforce sanctions on Iran 
        following Iran's ballistic missile tests on November 21, 2015, and 
        October 10, 2015;
Whereas Iran's launching of the missiles is in direct violation of United 
        Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 (2010) and United Nations 
        Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), thus violating the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and President Barack Obama failed 
        to take action against Iran to address these violations;
Whereas President Barack Obama released high-ranking detainees from the 
        detention facility at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 
        without providing advanced notice to Congress, which is required by law;
Whereas not only was such release in defiance of standing law, there is a high 
        rate of recidivism amongst released detainees who have actively engaged 
        in conflict against members of the Armed Forces of the United States and 
        which continues to threaten national security;
Whereas President Barack Obama led the push within the United Nations for the 
        establishment of a no-fly zone within Libya, while lacking a complete 
        strategy, established a hostile environment for United States diplomatic 
        and military personnel; and
Whereas President Barack Obama has failed to eliminate deficiencies within the 
        Department of Homeland Security's vetting process of Syrian refugees, 
        which threatens national security: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) does hereby censure and condemn President Barack Obama 
        for having willfully disregarded the President's constitutional 
        responsibilities as Commander in Chief of the United States 
        through his continued failed lack of foreign affairs strategy, 
        failure to follow the advice of military and intelligence 
        advisors, and failed national security policy; and
            (2) does hereby put President Barack Obama on notice and 
        strongly urges the President to reverse course and begin 
        fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities.
                                 <all>
