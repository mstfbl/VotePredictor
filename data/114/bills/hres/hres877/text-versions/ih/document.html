                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 20, 2016

 Mr. Duncan of Tennessee (for himself, Mr. DesJarlais, Mr. Cohen, and 
  Mr. Roe of Tennessee) submitted the following resolution; which was 
   referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and in 
 addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be 
subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration 
  of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee 
                               concerned

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Encouraging each State to enact legislation that increases the 
  likelihood of survival after sudden cardiac arrest in our Nation's 
                                schools.

Whereas the American Red Cross advocates that improved training and access to 
        automated external defibrillators (AEDs) could save 50,000 lives each 
        year;
Whereas the average response time to a 911 call is 8 to 12 minutes;
Whereas the likelihood of survival is reduced approximately 10 percent for each 
        minute defibrillation is delayed; and
Whereas sudden cardiac arrest is most effectively treated by combining CPR and 
        defibrillation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) encourages public schools in possession of one or more 
        AEDs to schedule annual AED training for all school personnel, 
        for which staff meetings or in-service days allocated under 
        State law for training programs in emergency first aid and 
        cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be used;
            (2) recommends that--
                    (A) the annual AED training may include teaching 
                the use of AEDs and information for school personnel 
                relating to the locations of AEDs, the school's 
                response plan, and the members of the school response 
                team;
                    (B) each public school in possession of one or more 
                AEDs should conduct an annual CPR and AED drill for 
                school personnel to practice the use of these life-
                saving measures and to evaluate the school's 
                preparedness in the event of a sudden cardiac arrest; 
                and
                    (C) when planning the training and drills, local 
                educational agencies (LEAs) and schools should 
                coordinate with other schools operating training 
                programs, any State-issued recommendations as to the 
                development or usage of appropriate programs, and the 
                American Heart Association Guidelines for 
                Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency 
                Cardiovascular Care; and
            (3) congratulates each State, including Tennessee, that has 
        already enacted and implemented such wise and life-saving 
        legislation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
