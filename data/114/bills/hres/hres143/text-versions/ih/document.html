                               RESOLUTION


 
  Urging the Government of Nigeria to move forward expeditiously with 
                      national general elections.

Whereas regularly scheduled elections are one of the hallmarks of a democratic 
        form of government;
Whereas Nigeria, since its independence in 1960, has adhered to democratic 
        political traditions and processes;
Whereas Nigeria is one of the largest and fastest growing free market economies 
        on the African continent;
Whereas the Government of Nigeria has been dealing with challenges relating to 
        the terrorist group, Boko Haram;
Whereas the armed forces of the Government of Nigeria has substantial military 
        expertise and is professional, well-trained and equipped, and capable of 
        maintaining peace and good order throughout the country;
Whereas the people of Nigeria can expect that the national general elections 
        will be conducted in a safe and secure environment and that all persons 
        exercising their right to vote will be protected by the Nigerian 
        Government's military and civilian authorities;
Whereas it would set a bad precedent to reward terrorists by delaying national 
        elections; and
Whereas delaying an election deprives voters of their right to select leaders of 
        their choosing: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls upon the Government of Nigeria to hold its 
        national general election on the date and time now scheduled;
            (2) expresses its solidarity with the people of Nigeria and 
        their aspirations for free and fair elections; and
            (3) supports efforts of the United States Government to 
        provide security assistance and training to the Government of 
        Nigeria to help achieve the international goal of combating, 
        defeating, and eliminating the national security threat 
        presented by the terrorist group, Boko Haram, and other groups 
        that pose threats to the democratic process and the right of 
        Nigerians to cast their votes in a free and fair national 
        general election.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
