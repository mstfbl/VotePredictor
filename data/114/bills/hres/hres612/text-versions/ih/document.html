                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2016 as ``National 
                        No One Eats Alone Day''.

Whereas social isolation in its many forms is far too prevalent in our schools 
        and communities;
Whereas one in four students in America experiences some form of bullying;
Whereas bullying includes harassment that may occur in the workplace, at 
        schools, in families, in social settings, and online;
Whereas feeling socially isolated at school negatively affects the mental 
        health, physical health, and academic outcomes of adolescents;
Whereas the health effects of social isolation include poor self-esteem, 
        anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions, increased risk 
        of substance abuse, and higher risk of poor physical health and 
        increased mortality;
Whereas social isolation, which often underlies bullying, is a more insidious 
        and harder to identify phenomenon, which is pervasively experienced by 
        many students regardless of where they are on the social spectrum;
Whereas the national recognized organization ``Beyond Differences'' empowers 
        students through peer-to-peer student leadership to help all children in 
        middle school and high school feel accepted, respected, and included;
Whereas Beyond Differences' ``National No One Eats Alone Day'' is a fine example 
        of students making a difference on their own school campus by making 
        sure that everyone is included at lunch;
Whereas in 2015, over 400,000 middle school students in over 700 schools in 38 
        States, participated in No One Eats Alone Day events on their campuses 
        with meaningful and lasting results; and
Whereas February 12, 2016, would be an appropriate day to designate as 
        ``National No One Eats Alone Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National No One Eats 
        Alone Day'' in order to acknowledge the positive impact ending 
        social isolation can have on fostering community and empowering 
        students; and
            (2) encourages middle schools across the country to 
        participate in No One Eats Alone events throughout the year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
