                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of a National Stalking Awareness Month.

Whereas 15 percent of women and 6 percent of men in the United States have at 
        some point during their lifetime experienced stalking victimization, 
        during which they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone 
        close to them would be harmed or killed;
Whereas, during a 1-year period, an estimated 7,500,000 persons in the United 
        States reported that they had been victims of stalking, and 61 percent 
        of female victims and 44 percent of male victims of stalking are stalked 
        by a current or former intimate partner, and 25 percent of female 
        victims and 32 percent of male victims are stalked by an acquaintance;
Whereas 11 percent of victims reported having been stalked for more than 5 
        years, and 46 percent of victims reported having been stalked at least 
        once a week;
Whereas 1 in 4 victims reported that stalkers had used email, instant messaging, 
        blogs, bulletin boards, Internet sites, chat rooms, or other forms of 
        electronic monitoring against them, and 1 in 13 victims reported that 
        stalkers had used electronic devices to monitor them;
Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic measures to protect 
        themselves, including changing identity, relocating, changing jobs, and 
        obtaining protection orders;
Whereas 1 in 7 victims reported having relocated in an effort to escape a 
        stalker;
Whereas approximately 1 in 8 employed victims of stalking missed work because 
        they feared for their safety or were taking steps to protect themselves, 
        such as by seeking a restraining order;
Whereas less than 50 percent of victims reported stalking to police, and only 7 
        percent of victims contacted a victim service provider, shelter, or 
        hotline;
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the laws of all 50 
        States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United 
        States;
Whereas stalking affects victims of every race, age, culture, gender, sexual 
        orientation, physical and mental ability, and economic status;
Whereas national organizations, local victim service organizations, campuses, 
        prosecutor's offices, and police departments stand ready to assist 
        stalking victims and are working diligently to develop effective and 
        innovative responses to stalking;
Whereas there is a need to improve the response of the criminal justice system 
        to stalking through more aggressive investigation and prosecution;
Whereas there is a need for increased availability of victim services across the 
        United States, and such services must include programs tailored to meet 
        the needs of stalking victims;
Whereas persons aged 18 to 24 experience the highest rates of stalking 
        victimization, and rates of stalking among college students exceed the 
        prevalence rates found in the general population;
Whereas as many as 75 percent of women in college who experience stalking-
        related behavior experience other forms of victimization, including 
        sexual or physical victimization, or both;
Whereas there is a need for effective responses to stalking on campuses; and
Whereas the House of Representatives finds that National Stalking Awareness 
        Month provides an opportunity to educate the people of the United States 
        about stalking: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National Stalking 
        Awareness Month;
            (2) applauds the efforts of the many stalking victim 
        service providers, police, prosecutors, national and community 
        organizations, campuses, and private sector supporters to 
        promote awareness of stalking;
            (3) encourages policymakers, criminal justice officials, 
        victim service and human service agencies, college campuses and 
        universities, and nonprofit organizations to increase awareness 
        of stalking and the availability of services for stalking 
        victims; and
            (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses 
        in the private sector, and the media to promote awareness of 
        the crime of stalking through National Stalking Awareness 
        Month.
