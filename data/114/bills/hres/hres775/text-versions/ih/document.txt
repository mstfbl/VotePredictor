                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the impact of Sister Cities International and expressing 
   support for the designation of July 15, 2016, as ``Sister Cities 
                          International Day''.

Whereas to facilitate and maintain world peace, cities, their elected officials, 
        and their citizens need to collaborate internationally, through 
        international organizations such as Sister Cities International;
Whereas in 2016 Sister Cities International is celebrating 60 years of global 
        citizen and civic diplomatic action, and helping support a future where 
        the world's cities, communities and its citizens can come together on 
        common ground;
Whereas Sister Cities International Day is a fitting occasion to commemorate the 
        significant impact that the organization has made in building bridges 
        across nations, cities and communities around the globe in order to 
        create and sustain world peace;
Whereas Sister Cities International was founded as a Presidential initiative by 
        President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 11, 1956, at the White House 
        Conference on citizen diplomacy to create more community-led global 
        relationships so that people of different cultures could appreciate 
        their differences and build partnerships that would lessen the chance of 
        new national conflicts;
Whereas since President Eisenhower, every sitting President has been the 
        Honorary Chairman of Sister Cities International;
Whereas Sister Cities International currently has over 570 member cities, 
        counties, and States with relationships with over 2,300 communities in 
        150 countries, spanning 6 continents, and having representation in 
        nearly every district represented in the House of Representatives;
Whereas the impact of Sister Cities International's programs in 2014 has 
        included participation of one million;
Whereas collectively, in 2014 the Sister Cities International network hosted 
        over 2,000 events and engaged over 30,000 volunteers throughout the 
        U.S.;
Whereas countless city, county, and State governments and their leaders have 
        been involved in global relationships due to Sister Cities 
        International;
Whereas these relationships include educational, economic, cultural, municipal 
        and humanitarian assistance exchange programs that are mutually 
        beneficial to each community;
Whereas Sister Cities International Day is a call to action for Americans and 
        citizens of the world to come together to celebrate the importance of 
        communities' continued commitment to supporting a more peaceful and 
        prosperous future through continued people to people exchanges;
Whereas Sister Cities International Day is an opportune time for Americans to 
        come together and show how powerful humanity can be when we unite to 
        promote peace, progress, and prosperity for a better world; and
Whereas July 15, 2016, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Sister 
        Cities International Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the lasting positive impact of Sister Cities 
        International; and
            (2) supports the designation of Sister Cities International 
        Day.
                                 <all>
