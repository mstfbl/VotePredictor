 Honoring Sisters Network Inc. for its work to raise awareness about 
 the tragic impact of breast cancer in the African-American community.

Whereas Sisters Network Inc. was founded in October 1994 by Karen E. Jackson, a 
        two-time breast cancer survivor, and Chief Executive Officer;
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. is a nationally recognized organization among 
        leading medical establishments and breast cancer physicians;
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. is ``committed to increasing local and national 
        attention to the devastating impact that breast cancer has in the 
        African-American community'';
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. has 40 affiliate survivor-run chapters in 22 
        States;
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. affiliate chapters collaborate with organizations 
        and community groups to coordinate the promotion of breast health 
        awareness in the African-American community through the ``Gift for Life 
        Block Walk'', an innovative door-to-door program, which allows the 
        community to meet survivors and hear their stories;
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. has designed ``Teens4Pink'', a national 
        interactive, 3-time award winning multilevel program to educate teen 
        girls, ages 12 to 16 on the importance of breast health and equip them 
        with knowledge to educate their families and communities;
Whereas in 2006, Sisters Network Inc. established the Breast Cancer Assistance 
        Program (BCAP) to provide support to breast cancer survivors, currently 
        in treatment and facing financial hardship;
Whereas in April 2010, Sisters Network Inc., hosted the historic ``Stop the 
        Silence 5KWalk/Run'' in Houston, Texas, the first national African-
        American Breast Cancer 5K/Run, which attracts thousands of participants 
        and has become an annual event;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, breast 
        cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African-American 
        women in 2016;
Whereas in 2016, approximately 30,700 new cases of breast cancer are expected to 
        occur among African-American women;
Whereas while the incidence rate of breast cancer is lower in African-American 
        women than White women, the mortality rate was 39 percent higher in 
        African-American women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013;
Whereas uninsured women have a 30 percent to 50 percent increased risk of dying 
        from breast cancer than those with insurance;
Whereas African-American women are twice as likely to have Triple Negative 
        Breast Cancer, the most aggressive molecular breast cancer sub-type;
Whereas African-American men ages 18 to 64 have a 76 percent higher risk of 
        dying from breast cancer than White men of the same age; and
Whereas Sisters Network Inc. is dedicated to raising awareness about and 
        reducing these troubling statistics: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives honors Sisters Network 
Inc. for raising awareness about the tragic impact that breast cancer 
has in the African-American community.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
