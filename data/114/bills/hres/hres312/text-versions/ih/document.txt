                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting raising awareness and educating the public about upper limb 
                      and lower limb differences.

Whereas April is designated as ``National Upper and Lower Limb Differences 
        Month'' and April 18 is designated as ``Wear Orange Day'' to recognize 
        upper and lower limb differences;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each 
        year 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb 
        reductions and 750 babies are born with lower limb reductions;
Whereas the cause of limb differences at birth is unknown; and
Whereas people with limb differences will face various difficulties, access to 
        information is critical in the determination of best treatment options 
        so that they may live healthy and productive lives: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Upper and Lower Limb Differences Month'' and 
``Wear Orange Day''.
                                 <all>
