                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting a Federal, publically-funded universal school meal and 
                           nutrition program.

Whereas school nutrition programs help end childhood hunger and provide access 
        to healthy, nutritious meals;
Whereas access to school meals has been shown to improve educational outcomes;
Whereas the United States Department of Agriculture's Community Eligibility 
        Provision was established to provide greater access to school meals 
        throughout the Nation;
Whereas the expansion of the Community Eligibility Provision to all schools 
        would increase the availability of school meals for students and reduce 
        childhood hunger;
Whereas the Community Eligibility Provision also eliminates any stigma that 
        accompanies free or reduced meals and students unable to purchase meals 
        due to insufficient account funds; and
Whereas expansion of the Community Eligibility Provision would further allow 
        schools to shift resources from paperwork to providing high quality 
        meals: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports a Federal, 
publically-funded universal school meal and nutrition program.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
