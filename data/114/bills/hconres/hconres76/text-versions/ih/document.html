                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that Taiwan and its people deserve 
                   membership in the United Nations.

Whereas for more than 50 years a close relationship has existed between the 
        United States and Taiwan, which has been of major economic, cultural, 
        and strategic advantage to both countries;
Whereas the people of Taiwan are not represented in the United Nations;
Whereas Taiwan has over the years repeatedly expressed its strong desire to 
        participate in the United Nations;
Whereas Taiwan has much to contribute to the work and funding of the United 
        Nations;
Whereas the world community has reacted positively to Taiwan's desire for 
        international participation, as shown by Taiwan's membership in the 
        Asian Development Bank, Taiwan's admission to the Asia-Pacific Economic 
        Cooperation group as a full member, Taiwan's membership in the World 
        Trade Organization, Taiwan's participation in the World Health 
        Organization, and Taiwan's participation in the International Civil 
        Aviation Organization; and
Whereas section 4(d) of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3303(d)) declares, 
        ``Nothing in this Act may be construed as a basis for supporting the 
        exclusion or expulsion of Taiwan from continued membership in any 
        international financial institution or any other international 
        organization.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that Taiwan and its people deserve 
membership in the United Nations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
