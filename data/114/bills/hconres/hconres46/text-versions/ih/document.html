 Expressing the sense of the Congress that the National Institutes of 
Health should encourage a global pediatric clinical trial network, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the National Institutes of Health should encourage a 
        global pediatric clinical trial network through the allocation 
        of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to supplement 
        the salaries of new and early investigators who participate in 
        the global pediatric clinical trial network;
            (2) National Institutes of Health grants, contracts, or 
        cooperative agreements should be awarded, solely for the 
        purpose of supplementing the salaries of new and early 
        investigators, to entities that participate in the global 
        pediatric clinical trial network;
            (3) the Food and Drug Administration should engage the 
        European Medicines Agency and other foreign regulatory entities 
        during the formation of the global pediatric clinical trials 
        network to encourage their participation; and
            (4) once a global pediatric clinical trial network is 
        established and becomes operational, the Food and Drug 
        Administration should continue to engage the European Medicines 
        Agency and other foreign regulatory entities to encourage and 
        facilitate their participation in the network with the goal of 
        enhancing the global reach of the network.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
