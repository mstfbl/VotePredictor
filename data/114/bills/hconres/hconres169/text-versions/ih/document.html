                    (A) 6 to be appointed by the Speaker; and
                    (B) 6 to be appointed by the minority leader.
    (b) Ex Officio Members.--The majority leader and the minority 
leader of the Senate and the majority leader and the minority leader of 
the House of Representatives shall be ex officio, voting members of the 
Committee, but shall not be counted for the purpose of ascertaining the 
presence of a quorum of the Committee.
    (c) Organization of Committee.--(1) A chairman from each House 
shall be designated from among the members of the Committee by the 
majority leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives.
    (2) A vice chairman from each House shall be designated from among 
the members of the Committee by the minority leader of the Senate and 
the minority leader of the House of Representatives.
    (3) The Committee may establish subcommittees comprised of only 
members from one House, who may consider only matters related solely to 
that House.
    (4)(A) No recommendation shall be made by the Committee except upon 
a majority vote of the members representing each House, respectively.
    (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any recommendation with 
respect to the rules and procedures of one House which only affects 
matters related solely to that House may only be made and voted on by 
the members of the committee from that House, and upon its adoption by 
a majority of such members shall be considered to have been adopted by 
the full Committee as a recommendation of the Committee. Once such 
recommendation is adopted, the full Committee may vote to make an 
interim or final report containing any such recommendation.

SEC. 2. STUDY OF ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE CONGRESS.

    (a) In General.--The Committee shall make a full and complete study 
of the organization, operations, functions, and relevant interactions

            (5) Improving the orderly, timely, and effective 
        consideration and disposal of legislation.
            (6) Improving the relationships among both elected Members 
        of the Congress and the staff of those Members, particularly 
        relating to relationships between the minority and majority 
        Members.
            (7) Improving the relationship between members and the 
        citizens they serve, especially in the opportunities citizens 
        have to participate in the process of governing.
    (b) Additional Matter To Be Studied.--The Committee shall also

committees and their effectiveness in addressing legislative 
responsibilities, particularly those involving the authorization of 
Federal programs and agencies and the future fiscal impact of 
entitlement programs.

information, facilities, and personnel of other agencies of the 
legislative branch.
    (c) Witnesses.--Witnesses requested to appear before the Committee 
shall be reimbursed for travel, subsistence, and other necessary 
expenses incurred in traveling to and from Committee proceedings.
    (d) Expenses.--There shall be paid out of the applicable accounts 
of the House of Representatives such sums as may be necessary for one-
half of the expenses of the Committee. Such payments shall be made on
