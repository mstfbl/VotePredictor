H. CON. RES. 103

Expressing the sense of the Congress that it runs contrary to America's

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that it runs contrary to America's 
  values to take away the constitutional rights of American citizens 
without due process, and that any legislation that would do so would be 
             unconstitutional and should not be considered.

Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the Second 
        Amendment of the United States Constitution grants individuals the right 
        to keep and bear arms;
Whereas, under current law, there are already sufficient and robust safeguards 
        that prevent terrorists from purchasing firearms in the United States;
Whereas the ``Terrorist Watch List'' is a tool for law enforcement, and not a 
        list of criminals or terrorists that have been afforded any due process;
Whereas the ``Terrorist Watch List'' sometimes includes American citizens that 
        have not been accused of any crime; and
Whereas categorically denying the right to purchase a firearm to anyone on the 
        ``Terrorist Watch List'' would include these citizens: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) it runs contrary to America's values to take away the 
        constitutional rights of American citizens without due process; 
        and
            (2) any legislation that would do so would be 
        unconstitutional and should not be considered.
                                 <all>
