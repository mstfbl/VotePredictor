                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that the President in consultation 
  with the Department of the Treasury should apply economic sanctions 
  against Chinese businesses and state-owned enterprises that can be 
         linked to cyberattacks against United States entities.

Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China and the People's 
        Liberation Army have used cyberweapons against the United States in a 
        deliberate, government-developed strategy to steal intellectual property 
        and gain a strategic advantage;
Whereas in 2009, China's People's Liberation Army siphoned sensitive details on 
        the F-35 fighter jet by compromising Lockheed Martin's computer network;
Whereas in December 2011, Chinese hackers compromised computer networks of the 
        United States Chamber of Commerce;
Whereas a 2012 Defense Science Board report identified dozens of critical system 
        designs compromised by Chinese cyber actors, including the Patriot 
        Advanced Capability-3 air defense system, the F-35 and the F/A-18 
        fighter aircraft, the P-8A reconnaissance aircraft, the Global Hawk UAV, 
        the Black Hawk helicopter, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, 
        and the Littoral Combat Ship;
Whereas the report also revealed Chinese cyber actors have obtained information 
        on various Department of Defense technologies, including directed 
        energy, the UAV video system, tactical data links, satellite 
        communications, electronic warfare systems, and the electromagnetic 
        aircraft launch system;
Whereas in January 2013, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New 
        York Times, and Twitter reported that Chinese hackers repeatedly 
        penetrated their computer systems over the preceding months beginning at 
        least in September 2012;
Whereas, on May 19, 2014, the Department of Justice indicted 5 Chinese military 
        hackers for computer hacking, economic espionage and other offenses 
        directed at 6 United States victims in the United States nuclear power, 
        metals, and solar products industries;
Whereas in March 2014, Chinese hackers breached the United States Office of 
        Personnel Management obtaining extensive information relating to 
        security clearances of 22,000,000 United States military and civilian 
        personnel across the country; and
Whereas, on April 1, 2015, the President of the United States signed an 
        Executive order finding that ``the increasing prevalence and severity of 
        malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by 
        persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United 
        States constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
        security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'', declaring 
        ``a national emergency to deal with this threat'', and sanctioning the 
        property and interests of those determined ``to be responsible for or 
        complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, cyber-
        enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in 
        whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that are 
        reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a 
        significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic 
        health or financial stability of the United States.'': Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the President should apply 
punitive economic sanctions to Chinese businesses and state-owned 
enterprises as a result of documented Chinese cyberattacks against 
United States entities in order to punish and deter such actions and 
strengthen the United States cybersecurity.
