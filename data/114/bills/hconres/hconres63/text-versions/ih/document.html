H. CON. RES. 63

  To express the sense of the Congress that any Executive order that 
  infringes on the powers and duties of the Congress under article I, 
section 8 of the Constitution, or that would require the expenditure of 
  Federal funds not specifically appropriated for the purpose of the 
  Executive order, is advisory only and has no force or effect unless 
                            enacted as law.

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  To express the sense of the Congress that any Executive order that 
  infringes on the powers and duties of the Congress under article I, 
section 8 of the Constitution, or that would require the expenditure of 
  Federal funds not specifically appropriated for the purpose of the 
  Executive order, is advisory only and has no force or effect unless 
                            enacted as law.

Whereas some Executive orders have infringed on the prerogatives of the Congress 
        and resulted in the expenditure of Federal funds not appropriated for 
        the specific purposes of those Executive orders: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that any Executive order issued by 
the President before, on, or after the date of the approval of this 
resolution that infringes on the powers and duties of the Congress 
under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, or that would require 
the expenditure of Federal funds not specifically appropriated for the 
purpose of the Executive order, is advisory only and has no force or 
effect unless enacted as law.
