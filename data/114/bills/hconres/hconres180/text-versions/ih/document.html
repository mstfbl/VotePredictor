                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that rates for inmate calling service 
should not exceed the affordable modified rates adopted by the Federal 
                       Communications Commission.

Whereas an estimated 5,000,000 United States children have, or have had, a 
        parent in prison or jail;
Whereas phone calls make it easier for families of incarcerated people to 
        maintain positive relationships with their loved ones behind bars;
Whereas phone calls help to reduce recidivism and promote child well-being;
Whereas a reduction in recidivism rates by just 1 percent would save taxpayers 
        $250,000,000 per year in correctional costs;
Whereas families of people who are incarcerated frequently experience financial 
        hardship because of the loss of a key wage earner;
Whereas the cost of maintaining contact with incarcerated loved ones through in-
        person visits is prohibitive;
Whereas written correspondence, especially with small children and those who are 
        disabled, is inadequate in maintaining communication; and
Whereas the Federal Communications Commission has been steadfast in its efforts 
        to bring about a compromise on inmate calling service rates and to 
        ensure that such rates are just and reasonable, in accordance with its 
        authority under the Communications Act of 1934: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) rates for inmate calling service should not exceed the 
        affordable modified rates adopted by the Federal Communications 
        Commission as of the date of the adoption of this resolution; 
        and
            (2) reduced inmate calling service rates should be 
        implemented as soon as possible because of the importance of 
        this rehabilitative means of communication.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
