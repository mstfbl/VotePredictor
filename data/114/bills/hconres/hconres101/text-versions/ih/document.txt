                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges 
   (AAVMC) and recognizing 50 years of organized academic veterinary 
                     medicine in the United States.

Whereas the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) is an 
        international academic association that represents all of the accredited 
        schools and colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States and 
        many around the world;
Whereas the profession of veterinary medicine plays a critical role in the 
        health and well-being of society, provides human-quality healthcare for 
        more than 180,000,000 beloved family pets in the United States, fosters 
        the abundance and safety of the Nation's food supply by promoting the 
        health and productivity of the Nation's herds and flocks, makes 
        important contributions to the protection of public health through food 
        safety and infectious disease control, and advances human and animal 
        well-being through biomedical research;
Whereas the schools and colleges of veterinary medicine serve as the foundation 
        of the profession, training and preparing future generations of 
        veterinarians for professional service, developing new and improved 
        diagnostic and therapeutic protocols, providing advanced support for 
        veterinarians practicing in communities around the Nation, and 
        conducting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of scientific research 
        every year;
Whereas the AAVMC helps advance the standards of excellence in academic 
        veterinary medicine, and makes critical and lasting contributions to the 
        quality of our schools and colleges of veterinary medicine;
Whereas the AAVMC is observing 50 years of public service in 2016 through a 
        broad-based celebration of academic veterinary medicine, an anniversary 
        year designed to celebrate and highlight the critical role our schools 
        and colleges of veterinary medicine play in the well-being of the 
        agricultural, companion animal and organized veterinary medical 
        communities; and
Whereas because the people and animals of the United States benefit 
        substantially as a result of the presence and the contributions of the 
        AAVMC, this anniversary celebration is a timely reminder of the 
        important contributions made by veterinarians in the promotion of human 
        and animal health and well-being in the United States: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes 50 years of organized academic veterinary 
        medicine; and
            (2) expresses its sincere and enduring gratitude and 
        support for all accredited schools and colleges of veterinary 
        medicine, which have grown and prospered as a result of the 
        work of the Association of American Veterinary Medical 
        Colleges.
                                 <all>
