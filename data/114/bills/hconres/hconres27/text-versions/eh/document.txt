SEC. 202. RECONCILIATION PROCEDURES.

    (a) Estimating Assumptions.--
            (1) Assumptions.--In the House, for purposes of titles III 
        and IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the chair of 
        the Committee on the Budget shall use the baseline underlying 
        the Congressional Budget Office's Budget and Economic Outlook: 
        2015 to 2025 (January 2015) when making estimates of any bill 
        or joint resolution, or any amendment thereto or conference 
        report thereon. If adjustments to the baseline are made 
        subsequent to the adoption of this concurrent resolution, then 
        such chair shall determine whether to use any of these 
        adjustments when making such estimates.
            (2) Intent.--The authority set forth in paragraph (1) 
        should only be exercised if the estimates used to determine the 
        compliance of such measures with the budgetary requirements 
        included in the concurrent resolution are inaccurate because 
        adjustments made to the baseline are inconsistent with the 
        assumptions underlying the budgetary levels set forth in this 
        concurrent resolution. Such inaccurate adjustments made after 
        the adoption of this concurrent resolution may include selected 
        adjustments for rulemaking, judicial actions, adjudication, and 
        interpretative rules that have major budgetary effects and are 
        inconsistent with the assumptions underlying the budgetary 
        levels set forth in this concurrent resolution.
            (3) Congressional budget office estimates.--Upon the 
        request of the chair of the Committee on the Budget of the 
        House for any measure, the Congressional Budget Office shall 
        prepare an estimate based on the baseline determination made by 
        such chair pursuant to paragraph (1).
    (b) Repeal of the President's Health Care Law Through 
Reconciliation.--In preparing their submissions under section 201(a) to 
the Committee on the Budget, the committees named in section 201(b) 
shall--
            (1) note the policies described in the report accompanying 
        this concurrent resolution on the budget that repeal the 
        Affordable Care Act and the health care-related provisions of 
        the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; and
            (2) determine the most effective methods by which the 
        health care laws referred to in paragraph (1) shall be repealed 
        in their entirety.
    (c) Revision of Budgetary Levels.--
            (1) Submission.--Upon the submission to the Committee on 
        the Budget of the House of a recommendation that has complied 
        with its reconciliation instructions solely by virtue of 
        section 310(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
        chair of the Committee on the Budget may file with the House 
        appropriately revised allocations under section 302(a) of such 
        Act and revised functional levels and aggregates.
            (2) Conference report.--Upon the submission to the House of 
        a conference report recommending a reconciliation bill or 
        resolution in which a committee has complied with its 
        reconciliation instructions solely by virtue of this section, 
        the chair of the Committee on the Budget of the House may file 
        with the House appropriately revised allocations under section 
        302(a) of such Act and revised functional levels and 
        aggregates.
            (3) Revision.--Allocations and aggregates revised pursuant 
        to this subsection shall be considered to be allocations and 
        aggregates established by the concurrent resolution on the 
        budget pursuant to section 301 of such Act.

SEC. 203. ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR RECONCILIATION.

    (a) Guidance.--In the House, the chair of the Committee on the 
Budget may develop additional guidelines providing further information,

forth in section 201.
    (b) Publication.--In the House, the chair of the Committee on the 
Budget may cause the material prepared pursuant to subsection (a) to be 
printed in the Congressional Record on the appropriate date, but not 
later than the date set forth in this title on which committees must 
submit their recommendations to the Committee on the Budget in order to

                 TITLE VI--ESTIMATES OF DIRECT SPENDING

SEC. 601. DIRECT SPENDING.

    (a) Means-Tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of 
        growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period 
        preceding fiscal year 2016 is 6.8 percent.
            (2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average 
        rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period beginning with fiscal year 2016 is 4.6 percent under 
        current law.
            (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent 
        resolution for means-tested direct spending:
                    (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic 
                president reformed welfare by limiting the duration of 
                benefits, giving States more control over the program, 
                and helping recipients find work. In the five years 
                following passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare 
                caseloads fell, and workers' wages increased. This 
                budget applies the lessons of welfare reform to both 
                the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and 
                Medicaid.
                    (B) For Medicaid, this budget assumes the 
                conversion of the Federal share of Medicaid spending 
                into flexible State allotments, which States will be 
                able to tailor to meet their unique needs. Such a 
                reform would end the misguided one-size-fits-all 
                approach that ties the hands of State governments and 
                would provide States with the freedom and flexibility 
                they have long requested in the Medicaid program. 
                Moreover, this budget assumes the repeal of the 
                Medicaid expansions in the President's health care law, 
                relieving State governments of the crippling one-size-
                fits-all enrollment mandates, as well as the 
                overwhelming pressure the law's Medicaid expansion puts 
                on an already-strained system.
                    (C) For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
                Program, this budget assumes the conversion of the 
                program into a flexible State allotment tailored to 
                meet each State's needs. The allotment would increase 
                based on the Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food 
                Plan index and beneficiary growth. Such a reform would 
                provide incentives for States to ensure dollars will go 
                towards those who need them most.
    (b) Nonmeans-Tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate 
        of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period preceding fiscal year 2016 is 5.4 percent.
            (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated 
        average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 
        10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2016 is 5.5 percent 
        under current law.
            (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent 
        resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:
                    (A) For Medicare, this budget advances policies to 
                put seniors, not the Federal Government, in control of 
                their health care decisions. Future retirees would be 
                able to choose from a range of guaranteed coverage 
                options, with private plans competing alongside the 
                traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. Medicare 
                would provide a premium-support payment either to pay 
                for or offset the premium of the plan chosen by the 
                senior, depending on the plan's cost. The Medicare 
                premium-support payment would be adjusted so that the 
                sick would receive higher payments if their conditions 
                worsened; lower-income seniors would receive additional 
                assistance to help cover out-of-pocket costs; and 
                wealthier seniors would assume responsibility for a 
                greater share of their premiums. Putting seniors in 
                charge of how their health care dollars are spent will 
                force providers to compete against each other on price 
                and quality. This market competition will act as a real 
                check on widespread waste and skyrocketing health care 
                costs. As with previous budgets, this program will 
                begin in 2024 and makes no changes to those in or near 
                retirement.
                    (B) In keeping with a recommendation from the 
                National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and 
                Reform, this budget calls for Federal employees--
                including Members of Congress and congressional staff--
                to make greater contributions toward their own 
                retirement.

                TITLE VII--RECOMMENDED LONG-TERM LEVELS

SEC. 701. LONG-TERM BUDGETING.

                     TITLE VIII--POLICY STATEMENTS

SEC. 801. POLICY STATEMENT ON BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government collects approximately $3 
        trillion annually in taxes, but spends more than $3.5 trillion 
        to maintain the operations of government. The Federal 
        Government must borrow 14 cents of every Federal dollar spent.
            (2) At the end of the year 2014, the national debt of the 
        United States was more than $18.1 trillion.
            (3) A majority of States have petitioned the Federal 
        Government to hold a Constitutional Convention for the 
        consideration of adopting a Balanced Budget Amendment to the 
        United States Constitution.
            (4) Forty-nine States have fiscal limitations in their 
        State Constitutions, including the requirement to annually 
        balance the budget.
            (5) H.J. Res. 2, sponsored by Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte (R-
        VA), was considered by the House of Representatives on November 
        18, 2011, though it received 262 aye votes, it did not receive 
        the two-thirds required for passage.
            (6) Numerous balanced budget amendment proposals have been 
        introduced on a bipartisan basis in the House. Twelve were 
        introduced in the 113th Congress alone, including H.J. Res. 4 
        by Democratic Representative John J. Barrow of Georgia, and 
        H.J. Res. 38 by Republican Representative Jackie Walorski of 
        Indiana.
            (7) The joint resolution providing for a balanced budget 
        amendment to the United States Constitution referred to in 
        paragraph (5) prohibited outlays for a fiscal year (except 
        those for repayment of debt principal) from exceeding total 
        receipts for that fiscal year (except those derived from 
        borrowing) unless Congress, by a three-fifths roll call vote of 
        each chamber, authorizes a specific excess of outlays over 
        receipts.
            (8) In 1995, a balanced budget amendment to the United 
        States Constitution passed the House with bipartisan support, 
        but failed of passage by one vote in the United States Senate.
    (b) Policy Statement.--It is the policy of this resolution that 
Congress should pass a joint resolution incorporating the provisions 
set forth in subsection (b), and send such joint resolution to the 
States for their approval, to amend the Constitution of the United 
States to require an annual balanced budget.

SEC. 802. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET PROCESS AND BASELINE REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) In 1974, after more than 50 years of executive 
        dominance over fiscal policy, Congress acted to reassert its 
        ``power of the purse'', and passed the Congressional Budget and 
        Impoundment Control Act.
            (2) The measure explicitly sought to establish 
        congressional control over the budget process, to provide for 
        annual congressional determination of the appropriate level of 
        taxes and spending, to set important national budget 
        priorities, and to find ways in which Members of Congress could 
        have access to the most accurate, objective, and highest 
        quality information to assist them in discharging their duties.
            (3) Far from achieving its intended purpose, however, the 
        process has instituted a bias toward higher spending and larger 
        government. The behemoth of the Federal Government has largely 
        been financed through either borrowing or taking ever greater 
        amounts of the national income through high taxation.
            (4) The process does not treat programs and policies 
        consistently and shows a bias toward higher spending and higher 
        taxes.
            (5) It assumes extension of spending programs (of more than 
        $50 million per year) scheduled to expire.
            (6) Yet it does not assume the extension of tax policies in 
        the same way. consequently, extending existing tax policies 
        that may be scheduled to expire is characterized as a new tax 
        reduction, requiring offsets to ``pay for'' merely keeping tax 
        policy the same even though estimating conventions would not 
        require similar treatment of spending programs.
            (7) The original goals set for the congressional process 
        are admirable in their intent, but because the essential 
        mechanisms of the process have remained the same, and 
        ``reforms'' enacted over the past 40 years have largely taken 
        the form of layering greater levels of legal complexity without 
        reforming or reassessing the very fundamental nature of the 
        process.
    (b) Policy Statement.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution on the budget that as the primary branch of Government, 
Congress must:
            (1) Restructure the fundamental procedures of budget 
        decision making.
            (2) Reassert Congress's ``power of the purse'', and 
        reinforce the balance of powers between Congress and the 
        President, as the 1974 Act intended.
            (3) Create greater incentives for lawmakers to do budgeting 
        as intended by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, especially 
        adopting a budget resolution every year.
            (4) Encourage more effective control over spending, 
        especially currently uncontrolled direct spending.
            (5) Consider innovative fiscal tools such as: zero based 
        budgeting, which would require a department or agency to 
        justify its budget as if it were a new expenditure; and direct 
        spending caps to enhance oversight of automatic pilot spending 
        that increases each year without congressional approval.
            (6) Promote efficient and timely budget actions, so that 
        lawmakers complete their budget actions by the time the new 
        fiscal year begins.
            (7) Provide access to the best analysis of economic 
        conditions available and increase awareness of how fiscal 
        policy directly impacts overall economic growth and job 
        creation.
            (8) Remove layers of complexity that have complicated the 
        procedures designed in 1974, and made budgeting more arcane and 
        opaque.
            (9) Remove existing biases that favor higher spending.
            (10) Include procedures by which current tax laws may be 
        extended and treated on a basis that is not different from the 
        extension of entitlement programs.
    (c) Budget Process Reform.--Comprehensive budget process reform 
should also remove the bias in the baseline against the extension of 
current tax laws in the following ways:
            (1) Permanent extension of tax laws should not be used as a 
        means to increase taxes on other taxpayers.
            (2) For those expiring tax provisions that are proposed to 
        be permanently extended, Congress should use a more realistic 
        baseline that does not require them to be offset.
            (3) Tax-reform legislation should not include tax increases 
        just to offset the extension of current tax laws.
    (d) Legislation.--The Committee on the Budget intends to draft 
legislation during the 114th Congress that will rewrite the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to fulfill the 
goals of making the congressional budget process more effective in 
ensuring taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and efficiently.

SEC. 803. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Although the United States economy technically emerged 
        from recession more than 5 years ago, the subsequent recovery 
        has felt more like a malaise than a rebound. Real gross 
        domestic product GDP growth over the past 5 years has averaged 
        slightly more than 2 percent, well below the 3.2 percent 
        historical trend rate of growth in the United States. Although 
        the economy has shown some welcome signs of improvement of 
        late, the Nation remains in the midst of the weakest economic 
        recovery of the modern era.
            (2) Looking ahead, CBO expects the economy to grow by an 
        average of just 2.3 percent over the next 10 years. That level 
        of economic growth is simply unacceptable and insufficient to 
        expand opportunities and the incomes of millions of middle-
        income Americans.
            (3) Sluggish economic growth has also contributed to the 
        country's fiscal woes. Subpar growth means that revenue levels 
        are lower than they would otherwise be while government 
        spending (e.g. welfare and income-support programs) is higher. 
        Clearly, there is a dire need for policies that will spark 
        higher rates of economic growth and greater, higher-quality job 
        opportunities.
            (4) Although job gains have been trending up of late, other 
        aspects of the labor market remain weak. The labor force 
        participation rate, for instance, is hovering just under 63 
        percent, close to the lowest level since 1978. Long-term 
        unemployment also remains a problem. Of the roughly 8.7 million 
        people who are currently unemployed, 2.7 million (more than 30 
        percent) have been unemployed for more than 6 months. Long-term 
        unemployment erodes an individual's job skills and detaches 
        them from job opportunities. It also undermines the long-term 
        productive capacity of the economy.
            (5) Perhaps most important, wage gains and income growth 
        have been subpar for middle-class Americans. Average hourly 
        earnings of private-sector workers have increased by just 1.6 
        percent over the past year. Prior to the recession, average 
        hourly earnings were tracking close to 4 percent. Likewise, 
        average income levels have remained flat in recent years. Real 
        median household income is just under $52,000, one of the 
        lowest levels since 1995.
            (6) The unsustainable fiscal trajectory has cast a shadow 
        on the country's economic outlook. investors and businesses 
        make decisions on a forward-looking basis. they know that 
        today's large debt levels are simply tomorrow's tax hikes, 
        interest rate increases, or inflation and they act accordingly. 
        This debt overhang, and the uncertainty it generates, can weigh 
        on growth, investment, and job creation.
            (7) Nearly all economists, including those at the CBO, 
        conclude that reducing budget deficits (thereby bending the 
        curve on debt levels is a net positive for economic growth over 
        time. The logic is that deficit reduction creates long-term 
        economic benefits because it increases the pool of national 
        savings and boosts investment, thereby raising economic growth 
        and job creation.
            (8) CBO analyzed the House Republican fiscal year 2016 
        budget resolution and found it would increase real output per 
        capita (a proxy for a country's standard of living) by about 
        $1,000 in 2025 and roughly $5,000 by 2040 relative to the 
        baseline path. That means more income and greater prosperity 
        for all Americans.
            (9) In contrast, if the Government remains on the current 
        fiscal path, future generations will face ever-higher debt 
        service costs, a decline in national savings, and a ``crowding 
        out'' of private investment. This dynamic will eventually lead 
        to a decline in economic output and a diminution in our 
        country's standard of living.
            (10) The key economic challenge is determining how to 
        expand the economic pie, not how best to divide up and re-
        distribute a shrinking pie.
            (11) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels 
        and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if 
        annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over 
        the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $326 billion.
            (12) This budget resolution therefore embraces pro-growth 
        policies, such as fundamental tax reform, that will help foster 
        a stronger economy, greater opportunities and more job 
        creation.
    (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--It is the policy 
of this resolution to promote faster economic growth and job creation. 
By putting the budget on a sustainable path, this resolution ends the 
debt-fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax 
code will put American businesses and workers in a better position to 
compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This resolution 
targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in 
favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve 
as means to the larger end of helping the economy grow and expanding 
opportunity for all Americans.

SEC. 804. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and 
        promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States 
        tax code fails on all three counts: It is notoriously complex, 
        patently unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code's 
        complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, which 
        leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job 
        creation.
            (2) Over the past decade alone, there have been 4,107 
        changes to the tax code, more than one per day. Many of the 
        major changes over the years have involved carving out special 
        preferences, exclusions, or deductions for various activities 
        or groups. These loopholes add up to more than $1 trillion per 
        year and make the code unfair, inefficient, and highly complex.
            (3) In addition, these tax preferences are 
        disproportionately used by upper-income individuals.
            (4) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the 
        code end up narrowing the tax base. A narrow tax base, in turn, 
        requires much higher tax rates to raise a given amount of 
        revenue.
            (5) It is estimated that American taxpayers end up spending 
        $160 billion and roughly 6 billion hours a year complying with 
        the tax code waste of time and resources that could be used in 
        more productive activities.
            (6) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax 
        rates dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which 
        reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic 
        output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher 
        marginal tax rates.
            (7) Roughly half of United States active business income 
        and half of private sector employment are derived from business 
        entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole 
        proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, 
        meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the 
        individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure 
        rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses, in 
        particular, tend to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, 
        and the top Federal rate on such small business income can 
        reach nearly 45 percent. For these reasons, sound economic 
        policy requires lowering marginal rates on these pass-through 
        entities.
            (8) The United States corporate income tax rate (including 
        Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to slightly more than 39 
        percent, the highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax 
        rates this high suppress wages and discourage investment and 
        job creation, distort business activity, and put American 
        businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign 
        competitors.
            (9) By deterring potential investment, the United States 
        corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The 
        United States tax rate differential with other countries also 
        fosters a variety of complicated multinational corporate 
        behaviors intended to avoid the tax, which have the effect of 
        moving the tax base offshore, destroying American jobs, and 
        decreasing corporate revenue.
            (10) The ``worldwide'' structure of United States 
        international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United 
        States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive 
        disadvantage with competitors with more competitive 
        international tax systems.
            (11) Reforming the United States tax code to a more 
        competitive international system would boost the 
        competitiveness of United States companies operating abroad and 
        it would also greatly reduce tax avoidance.
            (12) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through 
        lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors in 
        diminished returns.
            (13) Revenues have averaged about 17.4 percent of the 
        economy throughout modern American history. Revenues rise above 
        this level under current law to 18.3 percent of the economy by 
        the end of the 10-year budget window.
            (14) Attempting to raise revenue through new tax increases 
        to meet out-of-control spending would sink the economy and 
        Americans' ability to save for their retirement and their 
        children's education.
            (15) This resolution also rejects the idea of instituting a 
        carbon tax in the United States, which some have offered as a 
        new source of revenue. Such a plan would damage the economy, 
        cost jobs, and raise prices on American consumers.
            (16) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not 
        constitute fundamental tax reform.
            (17) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate 
        loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the 
        board not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Washington 
        has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.
            (18) Many economists believe that fundamental tax reform 
        (i.e. a broader tax base and lower tax rates) would lead to 
        greater labor supply and increased investment, which, over 
        time, would have a positive impact on total national output.
            (19) Heretofore, the congressional scorekeepers the 
        Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on 
        Taxation (JCT).
            (20) Static scoring implicitly assumes that the size of the 
        economy (and therefore key economic variables such as labor 
        supply and investment) remains fixed throughout the considered 
        budget horizon. This is an abstraction from reality.
            (21) A new House rule was adopted at the beginning of the 
        114th Congress to help correct this problem. This rule requires 
        CBO and JCT to incorporate the macroeconomic effects of major 
        legislation into their official cost estimates.
            (22) This rule seeks to bridge the divide between static 
        estimates and scoring that incorporates economic feedback 
        effects by providing policymakers with a greater amount of 
        information about the likely economic impact of policies under 
        their consideration while at the same time preserving 
        traditional scoring methods and reporting conventions.
    (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution that 
Congress should enact legislation that provides for a comprehensive 
reform of the United States tax code to promote economic growth, create 
American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, 
investors, and workers through fundamental tax reform that--
            (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American 
        families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and 
        resources necessary to comply with tax laws;
            (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals and 
        consolidates the current seven individual income tax brackets 
        into fewer brackets;
            (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;
            (4) reduces the corporate tax rate; and
            (5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system 
        of international taxation in a manner that does not 
        discriminate against any particular type of income or industry.

SEC. 805. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to 
        the United States economy and beneficial to American workers 
        and consumers. The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 
        billion of United States exports supports more than 5,000 jobs 
        here at home.
            (2) The United States can increase economic opportunities 
        for American workers and businesses through the expansion of 
        trade, adherence to trade agreement rules by the United States 
        and its trading partners, and the elimination of foreign trade 
        barriers to United States goods and services.
            (3) Trade Promotion Authority is a bipartisan and bicameral 
        effort to strengthen the role of Congress in setting 
        negotiating objectives for trade agreements, to improve 
        consultation with Congress by the Administration, and to 
        provide a clear framework for congressional consideration and 
        implementation of trade agreements.
            (4) Global trade and commerce is not a zero-sum game. The 
        idea that global expansion tends to ``hollow out'' United 
        States operations is incorrect. Foreign-affiliate activity 
        tends to complement, not substitute for, key parent activities 
        in the United States such as employment, worker compensation, 
        and capital investment. When United States headquartered 
        multinationals invest and expand operations abroad it often 
        leads to more jobs and economic growth at home.
            (5) Trade agreements have saved the average American family 
        of four more than $10,000 per year, as a result of lower 
        duties. Trade agreements also lower the cost of manufacturing 
        inputs by removing duties.
            (6) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a 
        level playing field, they can excel and surpass the 
        international competition.
            (7) When negotiating trade agreements, United States laws 
        on Intellectual Property (IP) protection should be used as a 
        benchmark for establishing global IP frameworks. Strong IP 
        protections have contributed significantly to the United States 
        status as a world leader in innovation across sectors, 
        including in the development of life-saving biologic medicines. 
        The data protections afforded to biologics in United States 
        law, including 12 years of data protection, allow continued 
        development of pioneering medicines to benefit patients both in 
        the United States and abroad. To maintain the cycle of 
        innovation and achieve truly 21st century trade agreements, it 
        is vital that our negotiators insist on the highest standards 
        for IP protections.
            (8) The status quo of the current tax code also undermines 
        the competitiveness of United States businesses and costs the 
        United States economy investment and jobs.
            (9) The United States currently has an antiquated system of 
        international taxation whereby United States multinationals 
        operating abroad pay both the foreign-country tax and United 
        States corporate taxes. They are essentially taxed twice. This 
        puts them at an obvious competitive disadvantage. A modern and 
        competitive international tax system would facilitate global 
        commerce for United States multinational companies and would 
        encourage foreign business investment and job creation in the 
        United States.
            (10) The ability to defer United States taxes on their 
        foreign operations, which some erroneously refer to as a ``tax 
        loophole,'' cushions this disadvantage to a certain extent. 
        Eliminating or restricting this provision (and others like it) 
        would harm United States competitiveness.
            (11) This budget resolution advocates fundamental tax 
        reform that would lower the United States corporate rate, now 
        the highest in the industrialized world, and switch to a more 
        competitive system of international taxation. This would make 
        the United States a much more attractive place to invest and 
        station business activity and would chip away at the incentives 
        for United States companies to keep their profits overseas 
        (because the United States corporate rate is so high).
    (b) Policy on Trade.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution to pursue international trade, global commerce, and a modern 
and competitive United States international tax system to promote job 
creation in the United States. The United States should continue to 
seek increased economic opportunities for American workers and 
businesses through the expansion of trade opportunities, adherence to 
trade agreements and rules by the United States and its trading 
partners, and the elimination of foreign trade barriers to United 
States goods and services by opening new markets and by enforcing 
United States rights. To that end, Congress should pass Trade Promotion 
Authority to strengthen the role of Congress in setting negotiating 
objectives for trade agreements, to improve consultation with Congress 
by the Administration, and to provide a clear framework for 
congressional consideration and implementation of trade agreements.

SEC. 806. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with 
        disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since 
        enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the 
        ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes 
        employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.
            (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly 
        recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
        challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the 
        financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious 
        and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security 
        disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
                    (A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
                will be exhausted and program revenues will be unable 
                to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and 
                Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program 
                revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2033, 
                benefits will be cut nearly 23 percent across the 
                board, devastating those currently in or near 
                retirement and those who rely on Social Security the 
                most.
            (3) The recession and continued low economic growth have 
        exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. 
        The most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections 
        find that Social Security will run cash deficits of more than 
        $2 trillion over the next 10 years.
            (4) Lower income Americans rely on Social Security for a 
        larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, 
        reforms should take into consideration the need to protect 
        lower income Americans' retirement security.
            (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential 
        income safety net for those with disabilities and their 
        families. According to the CBO, between 1970 and 2012, the 
        number of people receiving disability benefits (both disabled 
        workers and their dependent family members) has increased by 
        more than 300 percent from 2.7 million to over 10.9 million. 
        This increase is not due strictly to population growth or 
        decreases in health. David Autor and Mark Duggan have found 
        that the increase in individuals on disability does not reflect 
        a decrease in self-reported health. CBO attributes program 
        growth to changes in demographics, changes in the composition 
        of the labor force and compensation, as well as Federal 
        policies.
            (6) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on 
        the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face benefit 
        cuts of up to 20 percent in 2016, devastating individuals who 
        need assistance the most.
            (7) In the past, Social Security has been reformed on a 
        bipartisan basis, most notably by the ``Greenspan Commission'' 
        which helped to address Social Security shortfalls for more 
        than a generation.
            (8) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, 
        and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It 
        is critical that bipartisan action be taken to address the 
        looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this 
        resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions 
        by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security 
        remains a critical part of the safety net.
    (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this resolution 
that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security 
sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law 
trigger, such that:
            (1) If in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal 
        Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal 
        Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report 
        determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social 
        Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of 
        the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, 
        the Board of Trustees should, no later than September 30 of the 
        same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations for 
        statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year 
        actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th 
        year. Recommendations provided to the President must be agreed 
        upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of Trustees.
            (2) Not later than 1 December of the same calendar year in 
        which the Board of Trustees submit their recommendations, the 
        President should promptly submit implementing legislation to 
        both Houses of Congress including his recommendations necessary 
        to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive 
        annual balance in the 75th year. The Majority Leader of the 
        Senate and the Majority Leader of the House should introduce 
        the President's legislation upon receipt.
            (3) Within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, 
        the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has 
        been referred should report a bill, which should be considered 
        by the full House or Senate under expedited procedures.
            (4) Legislation submitted by the President should--
                    (A) protect those in or near retirement;
                    (B) preserve the safety net for those who count on 
                Social Security the most, including those with 
                disabilities and survivors;
                    (C) improve fairness for participants;
                    (D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty 
                for, future generations; and
                    (E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance 
                program while addressing the needs of those with 
                disabilities today and improving the determination 
                process.
    (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of this 
resolution that Congress and the President should enact legislation on 
a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability Insurance program prior to 
its insolvency in 2016 and should not raid the Social Security 
retirement system without reforms to the Disability Insurance system. 
This resolution assumes reform that--
            (1) ensure benefits continue to be paid to individuals with 
        disabilities and their family members who rely on them;
            (2) prevents a 20 percent across-the-board benefit cut;
            (3) makes the Disability Insurance program work better; and
            (4) promotes opportunity for those trying to return to 
        work.
    (d) Policy on Social Security Solvency.--Any legislation that 
Congress considers to improve the solvency of the Disability Insurance 
trust fund also must improve the long-term solvency of the combined Old 
Age and Survivors Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust fund.

SEC. 807. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPEALING THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW 
              AND PROMOTING REAL HEALTH CARE REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The President's health care law put Washington's 
        priorities first, and not patients'. The Affordable Care Act 
        (ACA) has failed to reduce health care premiums as promised; 
        instead, the law mandated benefits and coverage levels, denying 
        patients the opportunity to choose the type of coverage that 
        best suits their health needs and driving up health coverage 
        costs. A typical family's health care premiums were supposed to 
        decline by $2,500 a year; instead, according to the 2014 
        Employer Health Benefits Survey, health care premiums have 
        increased by 7 percent for individuals and families since 2012.
            (2) The President pledged ``If you like your health care 
        plan, you can keep your health care plan.'' Instead, the 
        nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates 9 million 
        Americans with employment-based health coverage will lose those 
        plans due to the President's health care law, further limiting 
        patient choice.
            (3) Then-Speaker of the House, Pelosi, said that the 
        President's health care law would create 4 million jobs over 
        the life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. 
        Instead, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the 
        reduction in hours worked due to Obamacare represents a decline 
        of about 2.0 to 2.5 million full-time equivalent workers, 
        compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the 
        law. The full impact on labor represents a reduction in 
        employment by 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent, while additional 
        studies show less modest results. A recent study by the 
        Mercatus Center at George Mason University estimates that 
        Obamacare will reduce employment by up to 3 percent, or about 4 
        million full-time equivalent workers.
            (4) The President has charged the Independent Payment 
        Advisory Board, a panel of unelected bureaucrats, with cutting 
        Medicare by an additional $20.9 billion over the next ten 
        years, according to the President's most recent budget.
            (5) Since ACA was signed into law, the administration has 
        repeatedly failed to implement it as written. The President has 
        unilaterally acted to make a total of 28 changes, delays, and 
        exemptions. The President has signed into law another 17 
        changes made by Congress. The Supreme Court struck down the 
        forced expansion of Medicaid; ruled the individual ``mandate'' 
        could only be characterized as a tax to remain constitutional; 
        and rejected the requirement that closely held companies 
        provide health insurance to their employees if doing so 
        violates these companies' religious beliefs. Even now, almost 
        five years after enactment, the Supreme Court continues to 
        evaluate the legality of how the President's administration has 
        implemented the law. All of these changes prove the folly 
        underlying the entire program health care in the United States 
        cannot be run from a centralized bureaucracy.
            (6) The President's health care law is unaffordable, 
        intrusive, overreaching, destructive, and unworkable. The law 
        should be fully repealed, allowing for real, patient-centered 
        health care reform: the development of real health care reforms 
        that puts patients first, that make affordable, quality health 
        care available to all Americans, and that build on the 
        innovation and creativity of all the participants in the health 
        care sector.
    (b) Policy on Promoting Real Health Care Reform.--It is the policy 
of this resolution that the President's health care law should be fully 
repealed and real health care reform promoted in accordance with the 
following principles:
            (1) In general.--Health care reform should enhance 
        affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation, choices and 
        responsiveness in health care coverage for all Americans, 
        putting patients, families, and doctors in charge, not 
        Washington, DC. These reforms should encourage increased 
        competition and transparency. Under the President's health care 
        law, government controls Americans' health care choices. Under 
        true, patient-centered reform, Americans would.
            (2) Affordability.--Real reform should be centered on 
        ensuring that all Americans, no matter their age, income, or 
        health status, have the ability to afford health care coverage. 
        The health care delivery structure should be improved, and 
        individuals should not be priced out of the health insurance 
        market due to pre-existing conditions, but nationalized health 
        care is not only unnecessary to accomplish this, it undermines 
        the goal. Individuals should be allowed to join together 
        voluntarily to pool risk through mechanisms such as Individual 
        Membership Associations and Small Employer Membership 
        Associations.
            (3) Accessability.--Instead of Washington outlining for 
        Americans the ways they cannot use their health insurance, 
        reforms should make health coverage more portable. Individuals 
        should be able to own their insurance and have it follow them 
        in and out of jobs throughout their career. Small business 
        owners should be permitted to band together across State lines 
        through their membership in bona fide trade or professional 
        associations to purchase health coverage for their families and 
        employees at a low cost. This will increase small businesses' 
        bargaining power, volume discounts, and administrative 
        efficiencies while giving them freedom from State-mandated 
        benefit packages. Also, insurers licensed to sell policies in 
        one State should be permitted to offer them to residents in any 
        other State, and consumers should be permitted to shop for 
        health insurance across State lines, as they are with other 
        insurance products online, by mail, by phone, or in 
        consultation with an insurance agent.
            (4) Quality.--Incentives for providers to deliver high-
        quality, responsive, and coordinated care will promote patient 
        outcomes and drive down health care costs. likewise, reforms 
        that work to restore the patient-physician relationship by 
        reducing administrative burdens and allowing physicians to do 
        what they do best--care for patients.
            (5) Choices.--Individuals and families should be free to 
        secure the health care coverage that best meets their needs, 
        rather than instituting one-size-fits-all directives from 
        Federal bureaucracies such as the Internal Revenue Service, the 
        Department of Health and Human Services, and the Independent 
        Payment Advisory Board.
            (6) Innovation.--Instead of stifling innovation in health 
        care technologies, treatments, medications, and therapies with 
        Federal mandates, taxes, and price controls, a reformed health 
        care system should encourage research, development and 
        innovation.
            (7) Responsiveness.--Reform should return authority to 
        States wherever possible to make the system more responsive to 
        patients and their needs. Instead of tying States' hands with 
        Federal requirements for their Medicaid programs, the Federal 
        Government should return control of this program to the States. 
        Not only does the current Medicaid program drive up Federal 
        debt and threaten to bankrupt State budgets, but States are 
        better positioned to provide quality, affordable care to those 
        who are eligible for the program and to track down and weed out 
        waste, fraud and abuse. Beneficiary choices in the State 
        Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid should 
        be improved. States should make available the purchase of 
        private insurance as an option to their Medicaid and SCHIP 
        populations (though they should not require enrollment).
            (8) Reforms.--Reforms should be made to prevent lawsuit 
        abuse and curb the practice of defensive medicine, which are 
        significant drivers increasing health care costs. The burden of 
        proof in medical malpractice cases should be based on 
        compliance with best practice guidelines, and States should be 
        free to implement those policies to best suit their needs.

SEC. 808. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
        their health security.
            (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
        that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed 
        soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of 
        Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in or 
        near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the 
        Medicare Trustees Report--
                    (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted in 2030 and unable to pay scheduled benefits;
                    (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to increase by 
                over 50 percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 baby 
                boomers reach retirement age each day;
                    (C) enrollees remain in Medicare three times longer 
                than at the outset of the program;
                    (D) current workers' payroll contributions pay for 
                current beneficiaries;
                    (E) in 2013, the ratio was 3.2 workers per 
                beneficiary, but this falls to 2.3 in 2030 and 
                continues to decrease over time;
                    (F) most Medicare beneficiaries receive about three 
                dollars in Medicare benefits for every one dollar paid 
                into the program; and
                    (G) Medicare spending is growing faster than the 
                economy and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a 
                rate of 6.5 percent per year over the next 10 years. 
                According to the Congressional Budget Office's 2014 
                Long-Term Budget Outlook, spending on Medicare is 
                projected to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product 
                (GDP) by 2043 and 9.3 percent of GDP by 2089.
            (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
        American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
        generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending 
        levels that cannot be sustained.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution 
to preserve the program for those in or near retirement and strengthen 
Medicare for future beneficiaries.
    (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare 
program such that--
            (1) current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or 
        near retirement;
            (2) permanent reform of the sustainable growth rate is 
        responsibly accounted for to ensure physicians continue to 
        participate in the Medicare program and provide quality health 
        care for beneficiaries;
            (3) when future generations reach eligibility, Medicare is 
        reformed to provide a premium support payment and a selection 
        of guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can 
        choose a plan that best suits their needs;
            (4) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as a 
        plan option;
            (5) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower 
        income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks; and
            (6) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
        Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.

SEC. 809. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAL DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, DELIVERY 
              AND INNOVATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) For decades, the Nation's commitment to the discovery, 
        development, and delivery of new treatments and cures has made 
        the United States the biomedical innovation capital of the 
        world, bringing life-saving drugs and devices to patients and 
        well over a million high-paying jobs to local communities.
            (2) Thanks to the visionary and determined leadership of 
        innovators throughout America, including industry, academic 
        medical centers, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
        the United States has led the way in early discovery. The 
        United States leadership role is being threatened, however, as 
        other countries contribute more to basic research from both 
        public and private sources.
            (3) The Organisation for Economic Development and 
        Cooperation predicts that China, for example, will outspend the 
        United States in total research and development by the end of 
        the decade.
            (4) Federal policies should foster innovation in health 
        care, not stifle it. America should maintain its world 
        leadership in medical science by encouraging competitive forces 
        to work through the marketplace in delivering cures and 
        therapies to patients.
            (5) Too often the bureaucracy and red-tape in Washington 
        hold back medical innovation and prevent new lifesaving 
        treatments from reaching patients. This resolution recognizes 
        the valuable role of the NIH and the indispensable 
        contributions to medical research coming from outside 
        Washington.
            (6) America is the greatest, most innovative Nation on 
        Earth. Her people are innovators, entrepreneurs, visionaries, 
        and relentless builders of the future. Americans were 
        responsible for the first telephone, the first airplane, the 
        first computer, for putting the first man on the moon, for 
        creating the first vaccine for polio and for legions of other 
        scientific and medical breakthroughs that have improved and 
        prolonged human health and life for countless people in America 
        and around the world.
    (b) Policy on Medical Innovation.--
            (1) It is the policy of this resolution to support the 
        important work of medical innovators throughout the country, 
        including private-sector innovators, medical centers and the 
        National Institutes of Health.
            (2) At the same time, the budget calls for continued strong 
        funding for the agencies that engage in valuable research and 
        development, while also urging Washington to get out of the way 
        of researchers, discoverers and innovators all over the 
        country.

SEC. 810. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Excessive regulation at the Federal level has hurt job 
        creation and dampened the economy, slowing the Nation's 
        recovery from the economic recession.
            (2) Since President Obama's inauguration in 2009, the 
        administration has issued more than 468,500 pages of 
        regulations in the Federal Register including 70,066 pages in 
        2014.
            (3) The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the 
        total cost of regulations is as high as $2.03 trillion per 
        year. Since 2009, the White House has generated more than $494 
        billion in regulatory activity, with an additional $87.6 
        billion in regulatory costs currently pending.
            (4) The Dodd-Frank financial services legislation (Public 
        Law 111-203) has resulted in more than $32 billion in 
        compliance costs and saddled job creators with more than 63 
        million hours of compliance paperwork.
            (5) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act to date has 
        added 132.9 million annual hours of compliance paperwork, 
        imposing $24.3 billion of compliance costs on the private 
        sector and an $8 billion cost burden on the States.
            (6) The highest regulatory costs come from rules issued by 
        the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); these regulations 
        are primarily targeted at the coal industry. In June 2014, the 
        EPA proposed a rule to cut carbon pollution from the Nation's 
        power plants. The proposed standards are unachievable with 
        current commercially available technology, resulting in a de-
        facto ban on new coal-fired power plants.
            (7) Coal-fired power plants provide roughly 40 percent of 
        the United States electricity at a low cost. Unfairly targeting 
        the coal industry with costly and unachievable regulations will 
        increase energy prices, disproportionately disadvantaging 
        energy-intensive industries like manufacturing and 
        construction, and will make life more difficult for millions of 
        low-income and middle class families already struggling to pay 
        their bills.
            (8) Three hundred and thirty coal units are being retired 
        or converted as a result of EPA regulations. Combined with the 
        de-facto prohibition on new plants, these retirements and 
        conversions may further increase the cost of electricity.
            (9) A recent study by the energy market analysis group 
        Energy Ventures Analysis Inc. estimates the average energy bill 
        in West Virginia will rise $750 per household by 2020, due in 
        part to EPA regulations. West Virginia receives 95 percent of 
        its electricity from coal.
            (10) The Heritage Foundation found that a phase-out of coal 
        would cost 600,000 jobs by the end of 2023, resulting in an 
        aggregate gross domestic product decrease of $2.23 trillion 
        over the entire period and reducing the income of a family of 
        four by $1,200 per year. Of these jobs, 330,000 will come from 
        the manufacturing sector, with California, Texas, Ohio, 
        Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Indiana, North 
        Carolina, Wisconsin, and Georgia seeing the highest job losses.
    (b) Policy on Federal Regulatory Reform.--It is the policy of this 
resolution that Congress should, in consultation with the public 
burdened by excessive regulation, enact legislation that--
            (1) promotes economic growth and job creation by 
        eliminating unnecessary red tape and streamlining and 
        simplifying Federal regulations;
            (2) requires the implementation of a regulatory budget to 
        be allocated amongst Government agencies, which would require 
        congressional approval and limit the maximum costs of 
        regulations in a given year;
            (3) requires congressional approval of all new major 
        regulations (those with an impact of $100 million or more) 
        before enactment as opposed to current law in which Congress 
        must expressly disapprove of regulation to prevent it from 
        becoming law, which would keep Congress engaged as to pending 
        regulatory policy and prevent costly and unsound policies from 
        being implemented and becoming effective;
            (4) requires a three year retrospective cost-benefit 
        analysis of all new major regulations, to ensure that 
        regulations operate as intended;
            (5) reinforces the requirement of regulatory impact 
        analysis for regulations proposed by executive branch agencies 
        but also expands the requirement to independent agencies so 
        that by law they consider the costs and benefits of proposed 
        regulations rather than merely being encouraged to do so as is 
        current practice; and
            (6) requires a formal rulemaking process for all major 
        regulations, which would increase transparency over the process 
        and allow interested parties to communicate their views on 
        proposed legislation to agency officials.

SEC. 811. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE 
              DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY.

    (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, 
        and wage growth.
            (2) Roughly 20 million students are enrolled in American 
        colleges and universities.
            (3) Over the past decade, tuition and fees have been 
        growing at an unsustainable rate. Between the 2004-2005 
        Academic Year and the 2014-2015 Academic Year--
                    (A) published tuition and fees at public 4-year 
                colleges and universities increased at an average rate 
                of 3.5 percent per year above the rate of inflation;
                    (B) published tuition and fees at public two-year 
                colleges and universities increased at an average rate 
                of 2.5 percent per year above the rate of inflation; 
                and
                    (C) published tuition and fees at private nonprofit 
                4-year colleges and universities increased at an 
                average rate of 2.2 percent per year above the rate of 
                inflation.
            (4) Federal financial aid for higher education has also 
        seen a dramatic increase. The portion of the Federal student 
        aid portfolio composed of Direct Loans, Federal Family 
        Education Loans, and Perkins Loans with outstanding balances 
        grew by 119 percent between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 
        2014.
            (5) This spending has failed to make college more 
        affordable.
            (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama 
        noted: ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; 
        we'll run out of money''.
            (7) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition 
        with ever-increasing debt. According to the Federal Reserve 
        Bank of New York, student debt now stands at nearly $1.2 
        trillion. This makes student loans the second largest balance 
        of consumer debt, after mortgage debt.
            (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and too many 
        fail to complete college or end up defaulting on these loans 
        due to their debt burden and a weak economy and job market.
            (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget 
        Office, the Pell Grant Program will face a fiscal shortfall 
        beginning in fiscal year 2017 and continuing in each subsequent 
        year in the current budget window.
            (10) Failing to address these problems will jeopardize 
        access and affordability to higher education for America's 
        young people.
    (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--It is the policy of 
this resolution to address the root drivers of tuition inflation, by--
            (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need;
            (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to make them 
        more effective;
            (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level at 
        $5,775 in each year of the budget window; and
            (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that 
        act to restrict flexibility and innovative teaching, 
        particularly as it relates to non-traditional models such as 
        online coursework and competency-based learning.
    (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House finds the 
following:
            (1) 8.7 million Americans are currently unemployed.
            (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking 
        for work are stymied by a broken workforce development system 
        that fails to connect workers with assistance and employers 
        with trained personnel.
            (3) The House Education and Workforce Committee 
        successfully consolidated 15 job training programs in the 
        recently enacted Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
    (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--It is the policy of this 
resolution to address the failings in the current workforce development 
system, by--
            (1) further streamlining and consolidating Federal job 
        training programs; and
            (2) empowering states with the flexibility to tailor 
        funding and programs to the specific needs of their workforce, 
        including the development of career scholarships.

SEC. 812. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) For years, there has been serious concern regarding the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) bureaucratic mismanagement 
        and continuous failure to provide veterans timely access to 
        health care and benefits.
            (2) In 2014, reports started breaking across the Nation 
        that VA medical centers were manipulating wait-list documents 
        to hide long delays veterans were facing to receive health 
        care. The VA hospital scandal led to the immediate resignation 
        of then-Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki.
            (3) In 2015, for the first time ever, VA health care was 
        added to the ``high-risk'' list of the Government 
        Accountability Office (GAO), due to management and oversight 
        failures that have directly resulted in risks to the 
        timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and quality of health care.
            (4) In response to the scandal, the House Committee on 
        Veterans' Affairs held several oversight hearings and 
        ultimately enacted the Veterans' Access, Choice and 
        Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) (Public Law 113-146) to 
        address these problems. VACAA provided $15 billion in emergency 
        resources to fund internal health care needs within the 
        department and provided veterans enhanced access to private-
        sector health care under the new Veterans Choice Program.
    (b) Policy on the Department of Veterans Affairs.--This budget 
supports the continued oversight efforts by the House Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs to ensure the VA is not only transparent and 
accountable, but also successful in achieving its goals in providing 
timely health care and benefits to America's veterans. The Budget 
Committee will continue to closely monitor the VA's progress to ensure 
resources provided by Congress are sufficient and efficiently used to 
provide needed benefits and services to veterans.

SEC. 813. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Given the thousands of Federal programs and trillions 
        of dollars the Federal Government spends each year, assessing 
        and accounting for Federal fiscal activities and liabilities is 
        a complex undertaking.
            (2) Current methods of accounting leave much to be desired 
        in capturing the full scope of government and in presenting 
        information in a clear and compelling way that illuminates the 
        best options going forward.
            (3) Most fiscal analysis produced by the Congressional 
        Budget Office (CBO) is conducted over a relatively short time 
        horizon: 10 or 25 years. While this time frame is useful for 
        most purposes, it fails to consider the fiscal consequences 
        over the longer term.
            (4) Additionally, current accounting methodology does not 
        provide an analysis of how the Federal Government's fiscal 
        situation over the long run affects Americans of various age 
        cohorts.
            (5) Another consideration is how Federal programs should be 
        accounted for. The ``accrual method'' of accounting records 
        revenue when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred, 
        while the ``cash method'' records revenue and expenses when 
        cash is actually paid or received.
            (6) The Federal budget accounts for most programs using 
        cash accounting. Some programs, however, particularly loan and 
        loan guarantee programs, are accounted for using accrual 
        methods.
            (7) GAO has indicated that accrual accounting may provide a 
        more accurate estimation of the Federal Government's 
        liabilities than cash accounting for some programs specifically 
        those that provide some form of insurance.
            (8) Where accrual accounting is used, it is almost 
        exclusively calculated by CBO according to the methodology 
        outlined in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). CBO 
        uses fair value methodology instead of FCRA to measure the cost 
        of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example.
            (9) FCRA methodology, however, understates the risk and 
        thus the true cost of Federal programs. An alternative is fair 
        value methodology, which uses discount rates that incorporate 
        the risk inherent to the type of liability being estimated in 
        addition to Treasury discount rates of the proper maturity 
        length.
            (10) The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that 
        ``adopting a fair-value approach would provide a more 
        comprehensive way to measure the costs of Federal credit 
        programs and would permit more level comparisons between those 
        costs and the costs of other forms of federal assistance'' than 
        the current approach under FCRA.
    (b) Policy on Federal Accounting Methodologies.--It is the policy 
of this resolution that Congress should, in consultation with the 
Congressional Budget Office and the public affected by Federal 
budgetary choices, adopt Government-wide reforms of budget and 
accounting practices so the American people and their representatives 
can more readily understand the fiscal situation of the Government of 
the United States and the options best suited to improving it. Such 
reforms may include but should not be limited to the following:
            (1) Providing additional metrics to enhance our current 
        analysis by considering our fiscal situation comprehensively, 
        over an extended time horizon, and as it affects Americans of 
        various age cohorts.
            (2) Expanding the use of accrual accounting where 
        appropriate.
            (3) Accounting for certain Federal credit programs using 
        fair value accounting as opposed to the current approach under 
        the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.

SEC. 814. POLICY STATEMENT ON SCOREKEEPING FOR OUTYEAR BUDGETARY 
              EFFECTS IN APPROPRIATION ACTS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
        directs the Committee on the Budget to provide an allocation of 
        budgetary resources to the Committee on Appropriations for the 
        budget year covered by a concurrent resolution on the budget.
            (2) The allocation of budgetary resources provided by the 
        Committee on the Budget to the Committee on Appropriations 
        covers a period of one fiscal year only, which is effective for 
        the budget year.
            (3) An appropriation Act, joint resolution, amendment 
        thereto or conference report thereon may contain changes to 
        programs that result in direct budgetary effects that occur 
        beyond the budget year and beyond the period for which the 
        allocation of budgetary resources provided by the Committee on 
        the Budget is effective.
            (4) The allocation of budgetary resources provided to the 
        Committee on Appropriations does not currently anticipate or 
        capture direct outyear budgetary effects to programs.
            (5) Budget enforcement could be improved by capturing the 
        direct outyear budgetary effects caused by appropriation Acts 
        and using this information to determine the appropriate 
        allocations of budgetary resources to the Committee on 
        Appropriations when considering future concurrent resolutions 
        on the budget.
    (b) Policy Statement.--It is the policy of the House of 
Representatives to more effectively allocate budgetary resources and 
accurately enforce budget targets by agreeing to a procedure by which 
the Committee on the Budget should consider the direct outyear 
budgetary effects of changes to mandatory programs enacted in 
appropriations bills, joint resolutions, amendments thereto or 
conference reports thereon when setting the allocation of budgetary 
resources for the Committee on Appropriations in a concurrent 
resolution on the budget. The relevant committees of jurisdiction are 
directed to consult on a procedure during fiscal year 2016 and include 
recommendations for implementing such procedure in the fiscal year 2017 
concurrent resolution on the budget.

SEC. 815. POLICY STATEMENT ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY, WASTEFUL, AND 
              UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required 
        by law to identify examples of waste, duplication, and overlap 
        in Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of such 
        examples.
            (2) In its report to Congress on Government Efficiency and 
        Effectiveness, the Comptroller General has stated that 
        addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in 
        Federal programs could ``lead to tens of billions of dollars of 
        additional savings.''.
            (3) In 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 the GAO issued reports 
        showing excessive duplication and redundancy in Federal 
        programs including--
                    (A) two hundred nine Science, Technology, 
                Engineering, and Mathematics education programs in 13 
                different Federal agencies at a cost of $3 billion 
                annually;
                    (B) two hundred separate Department of Justice 
                crime prevention and victim services grant programs 
                with an annual cost of $3.9 billion in 2010;
                    (C) twenty different Federal entities administer 
                160 housing programs and other forms of Federal 
                assistance for housing with a total cost of $170 
                billion in 2010;
                    (D) seventeen separate Homeland Security 
                preparedness grant programs that spent $37 billion 
                between fiscal years 2011 and 2012;
                    (E) fourteen grant and loan programs, and three tax 
                benefits to reduce diesel emissions;
                    (F) ninety-four different initiatives run by 11 
                different agencies to encourage ``green building'' in 
                the private sector; and
                    (G) twenty-three agencies implemented approximately 
                670 renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010 at 
                a cost of nearly $15 billion.
            (4) The Federal Government spends more than $80 billion 
        each year for approximately 1,400 information technology 
        investments. GAO has identified broad acquisition failures, 
        waste, and unnecessary duplication in the Government's 
        information technology infrastructure. experts have estimated 
        that eliminating these problems could save 25 percent or $20 
        billion.
            (5) GAO has identified strategic sourcing as a potential 
        source of spending reductions. In 2011 GAO estimated that 
        saving 10 percent of the total or all Federal procurement could 
        generate more than $50 billion in savings annually.
            (6) Federal agencies reported an estimated $106 billion in 
        improper payments in fiscal year 2013.
            (7) Under clause 2 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least one 
        hearing during each 120 day period following its establishment 
        on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government 
        programs.
            (8) According to the Congressional Budget Office, by fiscal 
        year 2015, 32 laws will expire, possibly resulting in $693 
        billion in unauthorized appropriations. Timely reauthorizations 
        of these laws would ensure assessments of program justification 
        and effectiveness.
            (9) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of 
        Federal Government programs should result in programmatic 
        changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding 
        levels.
    (b) Policy on Reducing Unnecessary, Wasteful, and Unauthorized 
Spending.--
            (1) Each authorizing committee annually should include in 
        its Views and Estimates letter required under section 301(d) of 
        the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 recommendations to the 
        Committee on the Budget of programs within the jurisdiction of 
        such committee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated.
            (2) Committees of jurisdiction should review all 
        unauthorized programs funded through annual appropriations to 
        determine if the programs are operating efficiently and 
        effectively.
            (3) Committees should reauthorize those programs that in 
        the committees' judgment should continue to receive funding.
            (4) For those programs not reauthorized by committees, the 
        House of Representatives should enforce the limitations on 
        funding such unauthorized programs in the House rules. If the 
        strictures of the rules are deemed to be too rapid in 
        prohibiting spending on unauthorized programs, then milder 
        measures should be adopted and enforced until a return to the 
        full prohibition of clause 2(a)(1) of rule XXI of the Rules of 
        the House.

SEC. 816. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
              CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office 
        of Management and Budget, Federal agencies were expected to 
        hold $844 billion in unobligated balances at the close of 
        fiscal year 2015.
            (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending 
        previously made available by Congress that remains available 
        for expenditure.
            (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it 
        remains available for obligation indefinitely.
            (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
        1974 requires the Office of Management and Budget to make funds 
        available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the 
        Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds 
        unless approved by an Act of Congress.
            (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review 
        and identify potential savings from canceling unobligated 
        balances of funds that are no longer needed.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
Unobligated Balances.--Congressional committees should through their 
oversight activities identify and achieve savings through the 
cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that neither 
abrogate contractual obligations of the Government nor reduce or 
disrupt Federal commitments under programs such as Social Security, 
veterans' affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance 
the national debt.
    (c) Deficit Reduction.--Congress, with the assistance of the 
Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and other 
appropriate agencies should continue to make it a high priority to 
review unobligated balances and identify savings for deficit reduction.

SEC. 817. POLICY STATEMENT ON AGENCY FEES AND SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) A number of Federal agencies and organizations have 
        permanent authority to collect fees and other offsetting 
        collections and to spend these collected funds.
            (2) The total amount of offsetting fees and offsetting 
        collections is estimated by the Office of Management and Budget 
        to be $525 billion in fiscal year 2016.
            (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not 
        fully transparent about the amount of program activity funded 
        through offsetting collections or fees. This lack of 
        transparency prevents effective and accountable government.
    (b) Policy on Agency Fees and Spending.--It is the policy of this 
resolution that Congress must reassert its constitutional prerogative 
to control spending and conduct oversight. To do so, Congress should 
enact legislation requiring programs that are funded through fees, 
offsetting receipts, or offsetting collections to be allocated new 
budget authority annually. Such allocation may arise from--
            (1) legislation originating from the authorizing committee 
        of jurisdiction for the agency or program; or
            (2) fee and account specific allocations included in annual 
        appropriation Acts.

SEC. 818. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER 
              DOLLARS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The budget for the House of Representatives is $188 
        million less than it was when Republicans became the majority 
        in 2011.
            (2) The House of Representatives has achieved significant 
        savings by consolidating operations and renegotiating 
        contracts.
    (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.--It is 
the policy of this resolution that:
            (1) The House of Representatives must be a model for the 
        responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources and therefore 
        must identify any savings that can be achieved through greater 
        productivity and efficiency gains in the operation and 
        maintenance of House services and resources like printing, 
        conferences, utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds 
        maintenance, postage, and rent. This should include a review of 
        policies and procedures for acquisition of goods and services 
        to eliminate any unnecessary spending. The Committee on House 
        Administration should review the policies pertaining to the 
        services provided to Members and committees of the House, and 
        should identify ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the 
        operation of the House gym, barber shop, salon, and the House 
        dining room.
            (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class 
        airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.
            (3) Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not 
        include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.

SEC. 819. POLICY STATEMENT ON ``NO BUDGET, NO PAY''.

    It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should agree to a 
concurrent resolution on the budget every year pursuant to section 301 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. If by April 15, a House of 
Congress has not agreed to a concurrent resolution on the budget, the 
payroll administrator of that House should carry out this policy in the 
same manner as the provisions of Public Law 113-3, the No Budget, No 
Pay Act of 2013, and should place in an escrow account all compensation 
otherwise required to be made for Members of that House of Congress. 
Withheld compensation should be released to Members of that House of 
Congress the earlier of the day on which that House of Congress agrees 
to a concurrent resolution on the budget, pursuant to section 301 of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, or the last day of that Congress.

SEC. 820. POLICY STATEMENT ON NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Russian aggression, the growing threats of the Islamic 
        State of Iraq and the Levant in the Middle East, North Korean 
        and Iranian nuclear and missile programs, and continued Chinese 
        investments in high-end military capabilities and cyber warfare 
        shape the parameters of an increasingly complex and challenging 
        security environment.
            (2) All four current service chiefs testified that the 
        National Military Strategy could not be executed at 
        sequestration levels.
            (3) The independent and bipartisan National Defense Panel 
        conducted risk assessments of force structure changes triggered 
        by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) and concluded that in 
        addition to previous cuts to defense dating back to 2009, the 
        sequestration of defense discretionary spending has ``caused 
        significant shortfalls in U.S. military readiness and both 
        present and future capabilities''.
            (4) The President's fiscal year 2016 budget irresponsibly 
        ignores current law and requests a defense budget $38 billion 
        above the caps for rhetorical gain. By creating an expectation 
        of spending without a plan to avoid the BCA's guaranteed 
        sequester upon breaching of its caps, the White House's 
        proposal compounds the fiscal uncertainty that has affected the 
        military's ability to adequately plan for future contingencies 
        and make investments crucial for the Nation's defense.
            (5) The President's budget proposes $1.8 trillion in tax 
        increases, in addition to the $1.7 trillion in tax hikes the 
        Administration has already imposed. The President's tax 
        increases would further burden economic growth and is not a 
        realistic source for offsets to fund defense sequester 
        replacement.
    (b) Policy on Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Funding.--In fiscal 
year 2015, the House-passed budget resolution anticipated $566 billion 
for national defense in the discretionary base budget for fiscal year 
2016. With no necessary statutory change yet provided by Congress, the 
BCA statute would require limiting national defense discretionary base 
funding to $523 billion in fiscal year 2016. However, in total with $90 
billion, the House Budget estimate for Overseas Contingency Operations 
funding for the Department of Defense, the fiscal year 2016 budget 
provides over $613 billion total for defense spending that is higher 
than the President's budget request for the fiscal year. This 
concurrent resolution provides $22 billion above the President's Five 
Year Defense Plan and $151 billion above the 10-year totals. This would 
also be $387 billion above the 10-year total for current levels.
    (c) Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund.--(1) The budget 
resolution recognizes the need to ensure robust funding for national 
defense while maintaining overall fiscal discipline. The budget 
resolution prioritizes our national defense and the needs of the 
warfighter by providing needed dollars through the creation of the 
``Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund''.
    (2) The Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund provides the 
mechanism for Congress to responsibly allocate in a deficit-neutral way 
the resources the military needs to secure the safety and liberty of 
United States citizens from threats at home and abroad. The Defense 
Readiness and Modernization Fund will provide the chair of the 
Committee on the Budget of the House the ability to increase 
allocations to support legislation that would provide for the 
Department of Defense warfighting capabilities, modernization, a 
temporary increase in end strength, training and maintenance associated 
with combat readiness, activities to reach full auditability of the 
Department of Defense's financial statements, and implementation of 
military and compensation reforms.
    (d) Sequester Replacement for National Defense.--This concurrent 
resolution encourages an immediate reevaluation of Federal Government 
priorities to maintain the strength of America's national security 
posture. In identifying policies to restructure and stabilize the 
Government's major entitlement programs which, along with net interest, 
will consume all Federal revenue in less than 20 years. The budget also 
charts a course that can ensure the availability of needed national 
security resources.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 25, 2015.
