                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that public health professionals 
 should be commended for their dedication and continued service to the 
  United States on ``Public Health Thank You Day'', November 21, 2016.

Whereas the health and safety of all people in the United States is the 
        foundation of a functioning democracy and strong economy;
Whereas emerging and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases pose an 
        ongoing threat to the health of people in the United States;
Whereas natural disasters and biological threats present a constant threat to 
        the life, health, and safety of all people in the United States;
Whereas poor air quality, poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, social 
        determinants, and behavioral factors exacerbate disease;
Whereas smoking rates have been nearly halved over the past 50 years, but 
        smoking still takes 480,000 lives each year in the United States;
Whereas obesity is one of the primary reasons only one-fourth of young people 
        between the ages of 17 and 24 are eligible for military service;
Whereas racial, ethnic, and geographical disparities in health and health care 
        pose a significant challenge to the Nation's strength, prosperity, and 
        productivity;
Whereas through research, surveillance and monitoring, prevention, health 
        promotion, and other strategies, tools, disciplines and programs, public 
        health professionals work tirelessly to reduce the burden of disease, 
        and in so doing play a crucial role in enhancing quality of life and 
        extending life expectancy;
Whereas public health professionals work diligently to prevent infectious 
        disease spillover and transmission, stem anti-microbial resistance, and 
        address other persistent and emerging global health threats;
Whereas first responders who put themselves in harm's way to defend the public 
        health are an invaluable resource to the United States and its citizens; 
        and
Whereas public health professionals have routinely proven their value in 
        reducing and abating environmental threats such as lead poisoning, 
        tracing and addressing food-borne illnesses, MRSA, and other disease 
        outbreaks, and increasing awareness of healthy lifestyle choices: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that public health professionals in 
the United States are to be celebrated, commended, and thanked for 
their profoundly important contributions to the Nation on Public Health 
Thank You Day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
