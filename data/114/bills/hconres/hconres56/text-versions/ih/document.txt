                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress that all trade agreements the United 
States enters into, should provide reasonable access and collaboration 
of each nation involved in such an agreement, for the purpose of search 
and recovery activities relating to members of the United States Armed 
    Forces missing in action from prior wars or military conflicts.

Whereas the Department of Defense Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) 
        Accounting Agency must currently approach MIA recovery operations on a 
        country by country basis via diplomatic, civil, and military 
        negotiations;
Whereas countries utilizing mutually beneficial trade agreements with the United 
        States should provide a transparent and efficient process to aid in the 
        recovery of United States POW/MIA operations;
Whereas the Department of Defense estimates approximately 1,627 United States 
        citizens who served during the Vietnam War are still unaccounted for in 
        Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia despite quarterly Joint Field Activity 
        excavation and recovery efforts;
Whereas some 73,000 members of the United States Armed Forces remain unaccounted 
        for throughout Europe, China, and Japan after sacrificing their lives 
        during World War II; and
Whereas nearly 8,000 members of the United States Armed Forces are still missing 
        on the Korean Peninsula after bravely serving during the Korean War: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that all trade agreements the United 
States enters into, should provide reasonable access and collaboration 
of each nation involved in such an agreement, for the purpose of search 
and recovery activities relating to members of the United States Armed 
Forces missing in action from prior wars or military conflicts.
