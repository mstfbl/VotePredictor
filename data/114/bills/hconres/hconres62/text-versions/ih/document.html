                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that Jerusalem is the capital of 
  Israel and therefore, consistent with the location of other United 
States embassies, the United States embassy in Israel should be located 
                             in Jerusalem.

Whereas the city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's Government, including its 
        President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and is the site of numerous 
        government ministries and social and cultural institutions;
Whereas since June 7, 1967, the city of Jerusalem has been an undivided city;
Whereas since 1995, it has been Federal law to recognize Jerusalem as the 
        capital of Israel and to relocate to Jerusalem the United States Embassy 
        in Israel, and this law has not been superseded;
Whereas this sense of Congress has no bearing on the final status of Jerusalem 
        as the United States is not a party to the Israel-Palestinian conflict;
Whereas the United States maintains its embassy in the functioning capital of 
        every country except in the case of the United States democratic friend 
        and strategic ally, the State of Israel; and
Whereas the United States maintains a consulate in the city of Jerusalem that 
        conducts the official business of the United States Government: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Government should officially 
        recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; and
            (2) the United States embassy in Israel should be located 
        in the city of Jerusalem.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
