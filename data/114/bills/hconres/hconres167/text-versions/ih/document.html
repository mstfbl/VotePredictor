has magnificently served as the play-by-play announcer for the Brooklyn 
  and Los Angeles Dodgers for 67 Major League Baseball seasons since 
                                 1950.

Whereas Vincent Edward ``Vin'' Scully was born in the Bronx, New York, on 
        November 29, 1927;
Whereas Vin Scully was raised in the Washington Heights neighborhood of 
        Manhattan, New York;
Whereas when Vin Scully was 8 years old he decided he wanted to become a sports 
        announcer;
Whereas, in 1950, at the age of 22, Vin Scully joined the radio and television 
        broadcast team for the Brooklyn Dodgers;
Whereas, in 1953, at the age of 25, Vin Scully became the youngest individual to 
        announce the broadcast of a World Series game;

        he moved with the Dodgers to Los Angeles as the first team in Major

        Angeles;

        played;
Whereas Vin Scully has announced numerous iconic moments in baseball history, 
        including--

    (1) on September 9, 1965, Vin Scully announced Los Angeles Dodgers' 
pitcher Sandy Koufax's perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, concluding, 
``Sandy Koufax, whose name will always remind you of strikeouts, did it 
with a flourish. He struck out the last 6 consecutive batters. So when he 
wrote his name in capital letters in the record book, that `K' stands out 
more than the `oufax'.'';

    (2) on April 8, 1974, Vin Scully called the 715th homerun by Hank Aaron 
to break Babe Ruth's longstanding homerun record, stating, ``What a 
marvelous moment for baseball, what a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the 
State of Georgia, what a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A 
black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a 
record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of 
us, and particularly for Henry Aaron.''; and

    (3) on October 15, 1988, during Game 1 of the 1988 World Series at 
Dodger Stadium, Vin Scully announced a game-winning, pinch hit homerun by

Dennis Eckersley, declaring, ``High fly ball into right field, she is gone! 
. . . In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has 
happened.'';

Whereas Vin Scully has described the exploits of some of baseball's all-time 
        greats, including Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Sandy Koufax, Don

Whereas Vin Scully will announce his final game on October 2, 2016, when the Los 
        Angeles Dodgers visit the San Francisco Giants: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors the life and legendary career of Vincent Edward 
        ``Vin'' Scully, whose character, artistry, and storytelling as 
        an announcer for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers has set 
        the standard for sports announcing; and
            (2) wishes Vin Scully a fulfilling retirement as he bids
