                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Condemning North Korea's February 6, 2016, long-range rocket launch and 
    North Korea's February 9, 2016, restart of a plutonium reactor.

Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1695 also required all Member 
        States, in accordance with their national legal authorities and 
        legislation and consistent with international law, to exercise vigilance 
        and prevent missile and missile-related items, materials, goods, and 
        technology being transferred to North Korea's missile or weapons of mass 
        destruction (WMD) programmes, and to prevent the procurement of missiles 
        or missile related-items, materials, goods, and technology from North 
        Korea, and the transfer of any financial resources in relation to North 
        Korea's missile or WMD programmes;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, adopted on October 14, 
        2006, decided that North Korea shall suspend all activities related to 
        its ballistic missile programme and in this context re-establish its 
        pre-existing commitments to a moratorium on missile launching;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 also imposed a ban on 
        the sales of military equipment and luxury goods to North Korea as well 
        as a ban on technology transfers;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 further required Member 
        States to prevent the travel of North Korean officials connected to the 
        ballistic missile or nuclear programs, the inspection of cargo from 
        North Korea to assure it was not missile, WMD, or nuclear-related, and 
        the immediate freezing of funds, other financial assets, and economic 
        resources that support these illicit North Korean activities;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, adopted on June 12, 
        2009, called upon Member States to inspect, seize, and dispose of 
        proscribed illicit North Korea items related to its missile, nuclear, 
        and WMD programmes and to prevent the provision of financial services or 
        the transfer to, through, or from their territory of any financial or 
        other assets or resources that could contribute to North Korea's 
        nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or other WMD-related 
        programmes or activities, and by denying fuel or supplies to service the 
        vessels carrying them;
Whereas, on October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test 
        in violation of previous United Nations Security Council resolutions;
Whereas, on May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test in 
        violation of previous United Nations Security Council resolutions;
Whereas, on December 12, 2012, North Korea launched a three-stage, long-range 
        missile in violation of previous United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions;
Whereas, on February 12, 2013, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test 
        in violation of previous United Nations Security Council resolutions;
Whereas, on January 6, 2015, North Korea claimed to have detonated a hydrogen 
        bomb in clear violation of previous United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions;
Whereas North Korea stated the purpose of testing this bomb was a claim of self-
        defense against the United States;
Whereas scientific consensus doubts the validity of this claim because 
        monitoring stations showed it not consistent with a test of hydrogen 
        bomb;
Whereas what is known is that North Korea has detonated a large-scale weapons 
        systems in violation of the United Nations sanctions;
Whereas North Korea's most recent detonation of a large-scale weapon represents 
        a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions 825 
        (1993), 1540 (2004), 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), and 1874 (2009), that 
        North Korea continues to defy the United Nations, its Six-Party 
        partners, and the international community, and that the Member States 
        should immediately impose sanctions covered by these resolutions and 
        censure North Korea;
Whereas North Korea tested a nuclear bomb on January 6, 2016;
Whereas the January 6, 2016, nuclear test was the fourth nuclear device North 
        Korea has tested;
Whereas United States Commanders of the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
        determined North Korea has the ability to launch rockets that have a 
        range to reach the United States, and that North Korea possesses the 
        technology to launch a nuclear weapon from a rocket;
Whereas the North Korea launch of a long-range rocket is a test of 
        internationally banned missile technology;
Whereas, on February 9, 2016, shortly after the February 6, 2016, rocket launch, 
        North Korea restarted a plutonium rector which was shut down in 2007; 
        and
Whereas the United States Congress has condemned North Korea's nuclear test on 
        January 6, 2016: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress condemns North Korea's February 6, 2016, long-range 
rocket launch and North Korea's February 9, 2016, restart of a 
plutonium reactor.
