  Mr. Kelly of Mississippi, Mr. Palazzo, and Mrs. Roby) submitted the

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress opposing the President's proposed 
                  Coastal Climate Resilience Program.

Whereas the Obama administration's climate regulations and carbon tax proposals 
        have been rejected by the Congress multiple times;
Whereas the President has advocated for, and implemented through executive 
        action, excessive and expensive regulations on the energy, agricultural, 
        and industrial sectors resulting in costs that are ultimately shouldered 
        by hard-working Americans;
Whereas the Obama administration's proposed Coastal Climate Resilience Program 
        would cost $2,000,000,000 and would divert funds already obligated by 
        law in the Gulf of Mexico Energy and Security Act of 2008 (43 U.S.C. 
        1331 note) and redistribute those monies to the Obama administration's 
        pet projects;
Whereas more than 300 groups oppose the proposed Coastal Climate Resilience 
        Program, including major environmental organizations, local governments, 
        civic groups, and businesses, for diverting funds from well-established 
        and science-based restoration and flood control projects in order to pay 
        for the President's politically motivated climate-related activities; 
        and
Whereas the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates that as of May 
        6, 2016, the Obama administration has spent $96,900,000,000 of direct 
        Federal funding on climate change-related activities: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Coastal Climate Resilience Program is not in the 
        best interest of American families, businesses, local 
        governments, wildlife, or public safety; and
            (2) Federal funds should not be made available for the 
        Coastal Climate Resilience Fund, the Coastal Climate Resilience 
        Program, or any substantially similar successor Federal 
        program.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
