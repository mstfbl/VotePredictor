                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances as the 
             cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations.

Whereas for more than 50 years, a close relationship has existed between the 
        United States and Taiwan, which has been of major economic, cultural, 
        and strategic advantage to both countries;
Whereas over the past two decades, the people of Taiwan have worked hard to 
        establish a vibrant and pluralistic democracy in their country and 
        conducted 5 successful Presidential elections, successive elections for 
        members of their national legislature, numerous local elections, and 2 
        national referendums;
Whereas the United States has vital security and strategic interests in the 
        Taiwan Strait, with United States troops stationed in countries within 
        the Taiwan Strait region;
Whereas April 10, 2015, marked the 36th anniversary of the enactment of the 
        Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8), codifying into law the basis for 
        continued commercial, cultural, and other relations between the United 
        States and Taiwan;
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act has been instrumental in maintaining peace, 
        security, and stability in the Taiwan Strait since its enactment in 
        1979;
Whereas when the Taiwan Relations Act was enacted, it affirmed that the United 
        States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's 
        Republic of China was based on the expectation that the future of Taiwan 
        would be determined by peaceful means;
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act declares that peace and stability in the area 
        are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United 
        States, and are matters of international concern;
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act states that it is the policy of the United 
        States to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character to maintain 
        the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion 
        that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of 
        the people on Taiwan;
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act also states that ``it is the policy of the 
        United States to preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly 
        commercial, cultural and other relations between the people on Taiwan, 
        as well as the people on the China mainland'';
Whereas in 1982, President Ronald Reagan wanted to reinforce United States 
        support for Taiwan and therefore issued the Six Assurances; and
Whereas the Six Assurances are guidelines to conduct relations between the 
        United States and Taiwan and stipulate that the United States would 
        not--

    (1) set a date for termination of arms sales to Taiwan;

    (2) alter the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act;

    (3) consult with China in advance before making decisions about United 
States arms sales to Taiwan;

    (4) mediate between Taiwan and China;

    (5) alter its position about the sovereignty of Taiwan which was, that 
the question was one to be decided peacefully by the Chinese themselves, 
and would not pressure Taiwan to enter into negotiations with China; and

    (6) formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan: Now, therefore, 
be it

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the United States hereby affirm 
that the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances together form the 
cornerstone of United States relations with Taiwan.
                                 <all>
