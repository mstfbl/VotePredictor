                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the challenges and burdens associated with the rising costs 
                        of a college education.

Whereas a college education is inextricably linked to economic opportunity in 
        the United States and the American Dream;
Whereas a college education is integral to the vibrancy and potency of the 
        American workforce;
Whereas an estimated 30 percent of job openings will require an associate's 
        degree or some college by 2020;
Whereas the rising costs of higher education are an obstacle to college 
        matriculation and completion;
Whereas the Federal student loan debt for all borrowers exceeds $1 trillion;
Whereas Federal, State, and local governments are pursuing strategies and 
        innovations which will make higher education more affordable and 
        accessible;
Whereas better utilizing our community colleges to address the rising costs of 
        higher education is one such strategy;
Whereas there are 1,100 or more community colleges in the United States;
Whereas approximately 40 percent of undergraduate students attend a community 
        college;
Whereas community colleges provide a cost-effective option to pursuing a college 
        degree;
Whereas community colleges offer open admission;
Whereas the cost of community college is approximately 50 percent lower than 
        traditional colleges and universities;
Whereas the Administration recently highlighted the importance of community 
        colleges through the America's College Promise proposal and made a 
        significant step in addressing the costs of higher education;
Whereas this proposal would provide two years of community college free for 
        hardworking students who are enrolled at least half-time in a community 
        college and maintain a good GPA;
Whereas this proposal could benefit approximately 9,000,000 students if all 
        States participate;
Whereas an average of $3,800 in tuition per year could be saved for full-time 
        community college students through this proposal;
Whereas Congress has a significant role in making college more affordable and 
        accessible; and
Whereas Congress can pass legislation which will reduce the rising costs of a 
        college education making college more accessible for all students: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the challenges and burdens associated with 
        the rising costs of a college education;
            (2) acknowledges the benefits of community colleges in 
        providing an affordable and cost effective way to obtain a 
        college degree;
            (3) supports the goals and ideals of the America's College 
        Promise proposal; and
            (4) commits to pursuing strategies in the 114th Congress 
        which will make college more affordable and accessible for all 
        students.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
