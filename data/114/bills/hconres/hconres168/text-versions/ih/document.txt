                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the United States Capitol 
Police and their role in securing the United States Capitol complex and 
  protecting Members of Congress, their staff, and the general public.

Whereas the United States Capitol Police (USCP) has provided protection for 
        Congress since 1828;
Whereas the USCP is governed by the Capitol Police Board and comprised of USCP 
        Chief of Police Matthew Verderosa and more than 2,200 officers and 
        civilian personnel;
Whereas the USCP has exclusive jurisdiction within all buildings and grounds of 
        the United States Capitol complex, including the Library of Congress, 
        and shares concurrent jurisdiction in an established area around the 
        Capitol complex;
Whereas USCP officers work tirelessly to protect life and property in and around 
        the Capitol complex;
Whereas the dynamic nature of threats and dangers posed to Congress and our 
        society in the 21st century present new obstacles for USCP to overcome;
Whereas the USCP has demonstrated its commitment to the institution of Congress 
        by quickly and effectively responding to such obstacles and threats 
        while minimizing loss to life and property; and
Whereas recent attacks targeting law enforcement across the United States 
        further exemplify the risks faced by USCP officers each and every day: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Capitol Police is an invaluable asset 
        to Congress and the community;
            (2) the United States Capitol Police deserve utmost 
        appreciation and respect; and
            (3) the Congressional community is expressly grateful for 
        the innumerable contributions and sacrifices made by the United 
        States Capitol Police to secure the United States Capitol 
        complex and protect Members of Congress, their staff, and the 
        general public.
                                 <all>
