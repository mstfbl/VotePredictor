                        Telecommunicators Week.

Whereas the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials (APCO)

Whereas there are over 6,000 public safety call centers, known as public safety 
        answering points, in the United States;
Whereas public safety communications professionals dedicate their lives to 
        helping others;
Whereas public safety communications professionals work under challenging and 
        stressful circumstances;
Whereas public safety communications professionals are an important part of the 
        first responder community, providing critical support to the Nation's 
        law enforcement, fire, and rescue personnel; and
Whereas public safety communications professionals are critical to helping 
        preserve public safety and the general welfare: Now, therefore, be it

That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Safety 
        Telecommunicators Week;
            (2) honors and recognizes the importance and contributions
