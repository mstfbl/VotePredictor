                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the President's executive amnesty 
   is illegal notwithstanding passage of H.R. 240, the Department of 
             Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2015.

Whereas on February 27th, 2015, the Senate passed H.R. 240, the Department of 
        Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2015 with no provisions to 
        address the President's executive amnesty;
Whereas on March 3rd, 2015, the House concurred in the Senate's amendments by a 
        vote of 257-167, despite opposition to the President's executive amnesty 
        even by those who supported the funding measure;
Whereas on March 4th, 2015, this bill was signed by the President and became 
        law;
Whereas Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States gives 
        Congress the power ``to establish a uniform rule of naturalization,'';
Whereas only Congress has the constitutional authority to legislate which 
        classes of aliens may be granted legal status and work authorization; 
        and
Whereas the passage of H.R. 240 to fund the Department of Homeland Security and 
        protect against ongoing terrorist threats could be misconstrued as the 
        consent of Congress to the President's illegal and unconstitutional 
        executive amnesty: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress affirms that the actions taken by the President to 
implement executive amnesty exceed his constitutional authority, and 
thus are unlawful. As used in this resolution, executive amnesty 
includes the following:
            (1) The memoranda issued by the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security on November 20, 2014, on any of the following 
        subjects:
                    (A) Southern border and approaches campaign.
                    (B) Policies for the apprehension, detention, and 
                removal of undocumented immigrants.
                    (C) Secure Communities.
                    (D) Personnel reform for Immigration and Customs 
                Enforcement officers.
                    (E) Exercising prosecutorial discretion with 
                respect to individuals who came to the United States as 
                children and with respect to certain individuals who 
                are the parents of citizens or permanent residents.
                    (F) Expansion of the Provisional Waiver Program.
                    (G) Policies supporting high skilled businesses and 
                workers.
                    (H) Families of Armed Forces members and enlistees.
                    (I) Directive to provide consistency regarding 
                advanced parole.
                    (J) Policies to promote and increase access to 
                citizenship.
            (2) The memoranda issued by the President on November 21, 
        2014, on any of the following subjects:
                    (A) Creating welcoming communities and fully 
                integrating immigrants and refugees.
                    (B) Modernizing and streamlining the immigrant visa 
                system for the 21st century.
            (3) Any substantially similar memorandum issued after 
        November 21, 2014.
            (4) The memorandum issued by the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security dated June 15, 2012, and effective on August 15, 2012 
        (or any substantially similar policy changes issued or taken on 
        or after January 9, 2015, whether set forth in memorandum, 
        Executive order, regulation, directive, or by other action).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
