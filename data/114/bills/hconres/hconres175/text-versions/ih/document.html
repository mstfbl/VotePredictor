  Mr. Lipinski (for himself and Mr. Brooks of Alabama) submitted the

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that Congress and the President should 
 prioritize the reduction and elimination, over a reasonable period of 
        time, of the overall trade deficit of the United States.

Whereas the United States has run 40 consecutive years of trade deficits;
Whereas the trade deficit of the United States has substantially increased in 
        the last 25 years;
Whereas the overall trade deficit of the United States in 2015 was $532 billion, 
        including a deficit of $758 billion in trade in goods;
Whereas the manufacturing sector of the United States has suffered a 
        disproportionate impact from such trade deficits, resulting in 
        substantial losses of jobs and industries;
Whereas a robust manufacturing capability is essential for national security;
Whereas trade imbalances are unhealthy for the global economy and stagnate 
        economic growth in deficit countries such as the United States and 
        especially in the manufacturing sectors of such countries;
Whereas certain foreign trading partners of the United States are running 
        persistent trade surpluses against the United States as an economic 
        growth alternative to fostering the domestic consumption of their 
        manufacturers;
Whereas persistent trade deficits hinder the ability of the United States to 
        reach full employment and increase underemployment and reliance on low-
        wage and often part-time service sector jobs; and
Whereas the United States national interest in trade policy lies in 
        strategically reducing and eliminating its currently massive trade 
        deficit, including a deficit in trade in goods, and reducing and 
        eliminating dependency of foreign countries on United States demand for 
        goods of such countries: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that Congress and the President should 
prioritize the reduction and elimination, over a reasonable period of 
time, of the overall trade deficit of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
