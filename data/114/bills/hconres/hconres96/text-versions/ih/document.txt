                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Condemning Palestinian incitement of violence and reaffirming the 
           special bond between Israel and the United States.

Whereas the recent wave of violence in Israel is a direct result of incitement 
        by radical Islamist elements under the false pretext of an impending 
        change in the status quo on the Temple Mount;
Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has repeatedly reiterated that 
        Israel has no intention of changing the status quo on the Temple Mount;
Whereas the intention of Palestinian incitement is to provoke violence and the 
        murder of Jews;
Whereas Palestinian terrorist attacks are part of the Palestinian Authority's 
        strategy of ``popular resistance'' that was formally adopted by the 
        Palestinian Authority and Fatah at the Sixth Fatah conference in August 
        2009;
Whereas Palestinian violence is driven by anti-Jewish incitement and 
        delegitimization of Israel's right to exist;

        October 31, 2015, 11 Israelis were killed and 146 wounded;

Whereas the Government of Israel meets acts of Jewish Israeli terrorism with a 
        firm action and clear condemnation;
Whereas the Palestinian Government praises Palestinian terrorists as heroes to 
        be commended and emulated;
Whereas the policy of the Government of Israel to keep holy sites of all 
        religions open for all to peacefully worship;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said on July 30, 2013, 
        that ``In a final resolution, [the Palestinian Authority] would not see 
        the presence of a single Israeli'' in the state of Palestine;
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas stated on a September 16, 
        2015, television broadcast that ``We welcome every drop of blood spilled 
        in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way to 
        Allah. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in heaven, and every 
        wounded will get his reward'';
Whereas the Palestinian Authority-appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh 
        Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, attempted to discredit and eliminate Israeli 
        claims to the Temple Mount by erroneously stating on an October 25, 
        2015, television broadcast that ``the Al-Aqsa Mosque was an Islamic 
        mosque since the world was created . . . it was never anything other 
        than a mosque'';
Whereas, on October 14, 2015, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 
        falsely accused the Government of Israel of executing a Palestinian boy, 
        who is alive and recovering in an Israeli hospital after he stabbed an 
        innocent Israeli citizen and was hit by an automobile, thus continuing 
        to incite violence against innocent Israelis;
Whereas, on September 30, 2015, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 
        said during a speech to the United Nations that the Palestinian 
        Authority is no longer bound to the 1995 Oslo Accords which established 
        the 2-state solution for peace;
Whereas in June 2013, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas referenced 
        Israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and dangerous plot to destroy Al-
        Aqsa and build the alleged temple'';
Whereas this month, a Palestinian family chose to name their newborn baby 
        ``Knife of Jerusalem'' in order to show solidarity with young 
        Palestinians involved in terrorist attacks against Israelis;
Whereas in a November 2014 address commemorating the 10th anniversary of Yasser 
        Arafat's death, President Abbas said that as Israel has no claim to 
        Jerusalem, he will not allow the Temple Mount to be ``contaminated by 
        Jews'', and threatened that Jewish prayer at the site would cause a 
        ``devastating religious war'';
Whereas Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated on October 19, 2015, following 
        an attack by Israeli civilians on a wrongfully suspected terrorist that 
        Israel is ``a country of law'' and that ``no one will take the law into 
        his own hands'';
Whereas Israelis and Palestinians alike have the right to live in safety and 
        dignity;
Whereas Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alternatively stated during an October 
        1, 2015, speech to the United Nations General Assembly that ``I am 
        prepared to immediately resume direct peace negotiations with the 
        Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever''; and
Whereas Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has not responded in kind: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the United States--
            (1) condemns each and every one of these acts of violence 
        against Israeli citizens in the strongest of terms;
            (2) believes that any chance at lasting peace can only 
        happen through peaceful, bilateral, discussions and sound 
        consultation with peaceful allies, not calls for bloodshed;
            (3) expresses support for individuals and organizations 
        working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and 
        Palestinians and the many activists within Israel and Palestine 
        working to bring an end to the conflict;
            (4) calls on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 
        and the international community to join us in condemning the 
        current wave of terrorism in Israel; and
            (5) reaffirms the friendship between Israel and the United 
        States.
