                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the United States Army Reserve 
                       Officers' Training Corps.

Whereas, June 3, 2016, marks the 100th anniversary of the United States Army 
        Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC);
Whereas Congress established the United States Army Reserve Officers' Training 
        Corps program in the National Defense Act of 1916;
Whereas Army ROTC has commissioned more than 500,000 second lieutenants;
Whereas Army ROTC serves as a critical component for the training of men and 
        women to take command, protecting our national security and way of life;
Whereas Army ROTC provides the next generation of innovative and adaptive 
        leaders while providing them with essential collegiate educational 
        opportunities;
Whereas Army ROTC commissioned 5,536 officers in 2014;
Whereas Army ROTC has produced 21 4-star generals since 2000;
Whereas Army ROTC is available at over 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 
        States and territories;
Whereas the Army has included programs like Green to Gold and Simultaneous 
        Membership program to allow enlisted servicemembers to gain a college 
        education and become an officer;
Whereas women have been an integral part of Army ROTC since the academic year of 
        1972-1973; and
Whereas Army ROTC serves as a way for individuals to gain college education and 
        serve the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps continues to 
        train the next generation of military leaders who are well 
        equipped to defeat the enemies of today and those that may 
        emerge;
            (2) Congress is encouraged by the quality of leaders that 
        Army ROTC has and will continue to produce; and
            (3) Army ROTC produces more Army officers than any other 
        source.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
