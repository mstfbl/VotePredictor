                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the members of the United States Air Force who were casualties 
  of the June 25, 1996, terrorist bombing of the United States Sector 
      Khobar Towers military housing complex on Dhahran Air Base.

Whereas June 25, 2016, marks the twentieth anniversary of the terrorist bombing 
        of the United States Sector Khobar Towers military housing complex on 
        Dhahran Air Base, also known as King Abdul Aziz Royal Saudi Air Base, 
        near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on June 25, 1996;
Whereas 19 members of the United States Air Force were killed, more than 500 
        other members of the Armed Forces of the United States were wounded, and 
        approximately 297 innocent Saudi and Bangladeshi civilians were 
        casualties in this terrorist attack;
Whereas the 19 members of the United States Air Force killed in this terrorist 
        attack while serving their country were Captain Christopher J. Adams, 
        Technical Sergeant Daniel B. Cafourek, Sergeant Millard D. Campbell, 
        Senior Airmen Earl F. Cartrette, Jr., Technical Sergeant Patrick P. 
        Fennig, Captain Leland T. Haun, Master Sergeant Michael G. Heiser, Staff 
        Sergeant Kevin J. Johnson, Staff Sergeant Ronald L. King, Master 
        Sergeant Kendall K. Kitson, Jr., Airman First Class Christopher B. 
        Lester, Airman First Class Brent E. Marthaler, Airman First Class Brian

        Jeremy A. Taylor, Airman First Class Justin R. Wood, and Airman First 
        Class Joshua E. Woody;
Whereas the families and friends of these brave servicemembers and the survivors 
        of this attack still mourn their loss;
Whereas the survivors of this terrorist attack suffer still, whether their 
        suffering be through physical injury, mental anguish, or through the 
        remembrance of their fallen compatriots;
Whereas the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia 
        indicted Ahmed Ibrahim al-Mughassil and 13 others on the count, among 
        others, of conspiracy to kill United States nationals;
Whereas Ahmed Ibrahim al-Mughassil is the former military chief of Hezbollah Al-
        Hejaz, also known as Saudi Hezbollah, a militant group known to be 
        supported by the terrorist group Hezbollah and the Islamic Republic of 
        Iran;
Whereas the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in a 
        civil action, found the Islamic Republic of Iran liable for the bombing 
        and ordered restitution to be paid to the servicemembers' families that 
        were party to the complaint;
Whereas, on or about August 26, 2015, Ahmed Ibrahim al-Mughassil was detained in 
        Beirut, Lebanon, and turned over to authorities of Saudi Arabia;
Whereas Ahmed Ibrahim al-Mughassil remains listed on the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation's most wanted terrorist list;
Whereas those guilty of carrying out this terrorist attack have yet to be 
        brought to justice; and
Whereas terrorism remains an ever-present threat which members of the United 
        States Armed Forces and other agents of the United States stand ready to 
        combat throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the terrorist bombing 
of the United States Sector Khobar Towers military housing complex on 
Dhahran Air Base, Congress--
            (1) recognizes the service and sacrifice of the 19 members 
        of the United States Air Force who were killed in that attack;
            (2) calls upon every citizen of the United States to pause 
        and pay tribute to those brave servicemembers;
            (3) extends its continued sympathies to the families and 
        friends of those who were killed;
            (4) acknowledges the anguish and resilience of the 
        survivors of that attack;
            (5) assures the members of the United States Armed Forces 
        and other agents of the United States serving in harm's way 
        throughout the world that their well-being and interests will 
        at all times be given the highest priority; and
            (6) declares that any perpetrators of terrorist acts 
        against members of the Armed Forces, other agents of the United 
        States, or United States citizens will be vigorously pursued 
        and finally brought to justice.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
