                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the designation of the week of September 11 to September 17 
                          as ``Patriot Week''.

Whereas Congress recognizes that understanding United States history and the 
        Nation's first principles are indispensable to the survival of our 
        republic as a free people;
Whereas in great reverence to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, 
        Congress acknowledges that United States citizens should take time to 
        honor the first principles, founders, documents, and symbols of their 
        history;
Whereas the events that led to the signing of the Constitution of the United 
        States by the delegates of the Constitutional Convention on September 
        17, 1787, have significance for every United States citizen and are 
        honored in public schools across the Nation on September 17 of each year 
        as Constitution Day;
Whereas the revolution, the rule of law, social compact, equality, unalienable 
        rights, and limited government are the first principles upon which the 
        Nation was founded and flourishes;
Whereas exceptional, visionary, and indispensable Americans such as Thomas 
        Paine, Patrick Henry, John Adams, John Marshall, George Washington, 
        Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick 
        Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison 
        founded or advanced the United States;
Whereas the Declaration of Independence, Marbury v. Madison, the resolution of 
        Congress of September 28, 1787, submitting the Constitution to the 
        several States, the Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments and 
        Resolutions, the 19th amendment to the United States Constitution, the 
        Gettysburg Address, the Emancipation Proclamation, the ``I Have a 
        Dream'' speech, the Bill of Rights, the original unamended Constitution, 
        and the 9th and 10th amendments to the United States Constitution are 
        key documents that embody the first principles and have advanced United 
        States liberty; and
Whereas the Bennington ('76) Flag, the Betsy Ross Flag, the current United 
        States Flag, the Suffragist Flag, the Union (Fort Sumter) Flag, the 
        Gadsden Flag, and the flags of the several States are fundamental 
        physical symbols of United States history and freedom that should be 
        studied and remembered by each citizen: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Patriot Week'';
            (2) recognizes that each generation ought to renew the 
        spirit of the Nation based on the first principles, historical 
        figures, founding documents, and symbols of the United States; 
        and
            (3) encourages citizens, schools and other educational 
        institutions, and Federal, State, and local governments and 
        their agencies, to recognize and participate in ``Patriot 
        Week'' by honoring and celebrating so that all may offer the 
        reverence that is due to the free republic.
                                 <all>
