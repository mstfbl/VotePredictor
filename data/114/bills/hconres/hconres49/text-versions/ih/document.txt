      Recognizing the daisy as the flower for military caregivers.

Whereas military caregivers are nameless, courageous, giving individuals whose 
        determination and sacrifices are rarely acknowledged and little known 
        outside of the military community;
Whereas a military caregiver can be identified as a father, mother, spouse, 
        sibling, family member, or loved one of a member of the uniformed 
        services or veteran who provides medical care to the member or veteran 
        suffering from a physical, mental, or emotional wound or injury;
Whereas since the first armed conflict of the United States, uniformed service 
        members have gone home after combat to be cared for by family members 
        and loved-ones;
Whereas the United States has always had caregivers since the War of 
        Independence to the Civil War and now attending to veterans as they 
        recover from seen and unseen wounds from combat operations;
Whereas military caregivers have shown time and time again, regardless of the 
        conflict, that caring for those who return home is a part of the 
        character of the United States;
Whereas many of the members and veterans who served in Operation Enduring 
        Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom suffered such wounds or injuries and 
        require assistance from a caregiver to complete activities of daily 
        living such as bathing, dressing, and feeding, or instrumental 
        activities such as transportation, meal preparation, and health 
        management;
Whereas, as many as 1,000,000 spouses, parents, and children of veterans have 
        served or are currently serving as family caregivers to veterans who 
        served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
        according to a study of military caregivers conducted by the RAND 
        Corporation;
Whereas section 1672 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2008 (Public Law 110-181; 10 U.S.C. 1071 note) introduced an expansion 
        of medical care available to family caregivers, and the Caregivers and 
        Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-163) 
        facilitated a new program for access to health insurance, mental health 
        services, caregiver training, and respite care by family caregivers of 
        veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom;
Whereas the love and loyalty of military caregivers endures through the 
        hardships of extended hospital stays, multiple surgeries, and lifetimes 
        of care and helps create a fresh start that is hopeful even during 
        difficult times;
Whereas the daisy is a flower that symbolizes both loyalty to love and new 
        beginnings; and
Whereas there is no more appropriate representation of the devotion and 
        determination to overcome obstacles shown every day by military 
        caregivers than the daisy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors military caregivers of members of the Armed 
        Forces and veterans for their service and sacrifice to the 
        United States;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to show 
        support to military families and the sacrifices endured by 
        those families in service to the United States; and
            (3) recognizes the daisy as the flower for military 
        caregivers.
