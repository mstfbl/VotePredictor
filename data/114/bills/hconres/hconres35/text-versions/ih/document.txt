                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the significance of Equal Pay Day to illustrate the 
             disparity between wages paid to men and women.

Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
        206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in compensation for equal work on 
        the basis of sex;
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) 
        prohibits discrimination in compensation because of race, color, 
        religion, national origin, or sex;
Whereas 5 decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 
        note), Census Bureau data shows that women working full time, year round 
        are paid an overall average of 78 cents for every dollar paid to men, 
        while Asian-American women working full time, year round are paid 79 
        cents, African-American women working full time, year round are paid 64 
        cents, Hispanic women working full time, year round are paid 56 cents, 
        and Native American women working full time, year round are paid 59 
        cents compared to White, non-Hispanic men;
Whereas the wage gap costs women who are employed full time in the United 
        States, as a group, more than $490 billion every year. These lost wages 
        mean families have less money to spend on goods and services that help 
        drive economic growth;
Whereas sex discrimination in education, hiring, and promotion has played a role 
        in maintaining a work force segregated by sex;
Whereas sex-based wage differentials--

    (1) depress employee wages and living standards necessary for their 
health and well-being;

    (2) reduce family incomes and contribute to the higher poverty rates 
among women and female-headed households;

    (3) prevent the effective and maximum utilization of the available 
labor resources; and

    (4) constitute an unfair method of competition;

Whereas opening traditionally male jobs to women and reducing occupational 
        segregation by sex increases earnings for women;
Whereas when women are paid fairly, families are stronger, business prospers, 
        and American values and the economy are strengthened;
Whereas fair pay strengthens the economic security of families and enhances 
        retirement savings;
Whereas nearly \2/3\ of workers paid the minimum wage or less are women and the 
        concentration of women in low-wage jobs is a significant contributor to 
        the wage gap;
Whereas nearly 50 percent of workers report that their employers either prohibit 
        or discourage them from discussing their pay, which keeps women from 
        learning when they are the victims of pay discrimination and remedying 
        that discrimination;
Whereas April 14, 2015, is Equal Pay Day, marking the day that symbolizes how 
        far into 2015 women must work until their pay from 2014 equals what men 
        were paid in 2014 alone; and
Whereas numerous national organizations have designated Tuesday, April 14, 2015, 
        as Equal Pay Day to represent the additional time that women must work 
        to compensate for the average 22 percent lower wages paid to women last 
        year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress recognizes the significance of Equal Pay Day to 
illustrate the disparity between wages paid to men and women, and its 
impact on women, families, and the Nation.
