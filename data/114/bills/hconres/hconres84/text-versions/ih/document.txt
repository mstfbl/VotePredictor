Recognizing former United States Federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson, Jr. 
               for his role in the civil rights movement.

Whereas Judge Johnson served bravely in the armed forces during World War II 
        before pursuing a legal career;
Whereas Judge Johnson served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 
        U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and the U.S. District 
        Court for the Middle District of Alabama;
Whereas in each capacity he courageously worked to advance the constitutional 
        principles of freedom and equality;
Whereas in 1956, in his decision in Browder v. Gayle, Judge Johnson struck down 
        the Alabama bus segregation laws, assisting the leaders of the civil 
        rights movement engaged in the Montgomery Bus Boycott;
Whereas in 1961, in his decision in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, Judge Johnson 
        invalidated as a violation of the 15th amendment an electoral plan 
        setting the boundaries for the city of Tuskegee, Alabama, that 
        systematically excluded Black voters;
Whereas in 1961, in his decision in U.S. v. Alabama, Judge Johnson ordered that 
        African-American registration be evaluated as equally as the least 
        qualified White applicant approved for the voting rolls;
Whereas in 1961, in his decision in Lewis v. Greyhound, Judge Johnson ordered 
        the desegregation of the bus facilities in the city of Montgomery, 
        Alabama;
Whereas in 1961, in his decision in U.S. v. City of Montgomery, Judge Johnson 
        required the city of Montgomery, Alabama, to surrender its voting 
        registration records to the Department of Justice so that they could 
        determine African-American voter registration;
Whereas in 1962, in his decision in Sim v. Frink, Judge Johnson required the 
        State of Alabama to reapportion State legislative districts to abide by 
        the ``one man, one vote'' principle;
Whereas in 1963, in his decision in Lee v. Macon County Board of Education, 
        Judge Johnson ordered the desegregation of public schools in Alabama, 
        the first statewide desegregation order of public schools in the Nation;
Whereas in 1965, in his decision in Williams v. Wallace, Judge Johnson blocked 
        Governor George Wallace's prohibition in Alabama of the Southern 
        Christian Leadership Conference's Selma to Montgomery march for voting 
        rights;
Whereas in 1966, in his decision in White v. Crook, Judge Johnson ruled that the 
        State of Alabama must grant African-Americans the right to serve on 
        juries;
Whereas in 1970, in his decision in Smith v. YMCA of Montgomery, Judge Johnson 
        ordered the desegregation of the Montgomery chapter of the YMCA;
Whereas in 1974, in his decision in U.S. v. Dothard, Judge Johnson ordered that 
        the Alabama Department of Public Safety stop systematically excluding 
        African-Americans from employment within its agency;
Whereas in 1974, in his decision in Doe v. Plyler, Judge Johnson struck down a 
        law that imposed a tuition of $1,000 on the children of undocumented 
        immigrants;
Whereas in 1995, Judge Johnson, in recognition of his decisions and service in 
        pursuit of justice and equality for all, was awarded the Presidential 
        Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton;
Whereas the insight and constitutional judgment of Judge Johnson was invaluable 
        and aided the Supreme Court as it recognized the violations and 
        injustices in the Nation during the civil rights movement;
Whereas the Supreme Court upheld and utilized the wisdom from many of Judge 
        Johnson's decisions; and
Whereas it is evident that the civil rights movement would have been at a great 
        disadvantage if someone without Judge Johnson's judicious temperament, 
        constitutional mindset, and dedication to rule of law had served in his 
        stead: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress recognizes former United States Federal Judge Frank Minis 
Johnson, Jr., for his role in the civil rights movement.
