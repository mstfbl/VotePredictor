                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress that the radical Islamic movement in 
 Afghanistan known as the Taliban should be recognized officially as a 
    foreign terrorist organization by the United States Government.

Whereas under section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1189(a)) an organization is defined as a foreign terrorist organization 
        if the organization is a foreign organization, is engaged in terrorist 
        activity, and its terrorist activity threatens the security of United 
        States nationals or the national security of the United States;
Whereas the Taliban is recognized as a terrorist organization by the Department 
        of the Treasury and the National Counterterrorism Center;
Whereas the Taliban does not appear on the Department of State's list of foreign 
        terrorist organizations;
Whereas the Taliban provided a safe haven for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to 
        conduct planning, training, and operations for the September 11, 2001, 
        attacks, resulting in the deaths of 2,977 innocent persons;
Whereas over 1,800 United States service personnel have been killed in action 
        and over 19,000 wounded in action combating the Taliban during Operation 
        Enduring Freedom;
Whereas the Taliban remains a proven national security threat to the United 
        States;
Whereas the Taliban continues its domestic reign of terror in Afghanistan, being 
        responsible for three-quarters of the civilian casualties in Afghanistan 
        in 2014; and
Whereas the Taliban continue to kill United States citizens, murdering three 
        Americans in Kabul on January 29, 2015: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) calls on the Department of State and the Administration 
        to recognize officially the Taliban as a foreign terrorist 
        organization; and
            (2) requests the Secretary of State to designate the 
        Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization under section 
        219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1189(a)) and impose any and all restrictions and sanctions that 
        apply with respect to such designation.
                                 <all>
