                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing a commitment by Congress to never forget the service of 
                      aviation's first responders.

Whereas the events of September 11, 2001, forever changed the United States as 
        the people of the United States faced unspeakable grief and destruction 
        that touched millions of lives;
Whereas 4 commercial aircraft were turned into weapons of mass destruction, 
        killing nearly 3,000 innocent people at the World Trade Center, the 
        Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania;
Whereas the crewmembers of United Flight 175, American Flight 11, American 
        Flight 77, and United Flight 93 acted as first responders, reporting the 
        first intelligence of a war the United States did not know it was 
        fighting and sacrificing their own lives to protect the United States 
        and the lives of countless others;
Whereas ever since 9/11, pilots and flight attendants in the United States 
        report to work with heightened responsibilities as first responders and 
        as the last line of defense in aviation security; and
Whereas the bravery of the crewmembers 15 years ago and our crewmember heroes 
        are prominent in the hearts and minds of the people of the United 
        States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) commits to never forget the service of aviation's first 
        responders on that fateful day; and
            (2) will always seek to honor the sacrifice of those first 
        responders.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
