                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas the Republic of Korea (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as 
        ``South Korea'') and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
        (hereinafter in this resolution referred to as ``North Korea'') remain 
        divided since the armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953;
Whereas the United States, which as a signatory to the armistice agreement as 
        representing the United

              

 Nations Forces Command, and with 28,500 of its troops currently stationed 
in South Korea, has a stake in peace on the Korean Peninsula and is home to 
more than 1,700,000 Americans of Korean descent;

Whereas the division on the Korean Peninsula separated more than 10,000,000 
        Korean family members, including some who are now citizens of the United 
        States;
Whereas there have been 19 rounds of family reunions between South Koreans and 
        North Koreans along the border since 2000;
Whereas Congress signaled its interest in family reunions between United States 
        Citizens and their relatives in North Korea in section 1265 of the 
        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-
        181), signed into law by President George W. Bush on January 28, 2008;
Whereas the number of more than 100,000 estimated divided family members in the 
        United States last identified in 2001 has been significantly dwindling 
        as many of them have passed away;
Whereas many Korean Americans are waiting for a chance to meet their relatives 
        in North Korea for the first time in more than 60 years; and
Whereas peace on the Korean Peninsula remains a long-term goal for the 
        Governments of South Korea and the United States, and would mean greater 
        security and stability for the region and the world: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) encourages North Korea to allow Korean Americans to 
        meet with their family members from North Korea; and
            (2) calls on North Korea to take concrete steps to build 
        goodwill that is conducive to peace on the Korean Peninsula.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 29, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
