                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the designation of the year of 2015 as the International 
      Year of Soils and supporting locally led soil conservation.

Whereas many of our international partners are designating 2015 as the 
        International Year of Soils;
Whereas soil is vitally important for food security and essential ecosystem 
        functions;
Whereas soil conservation efforts in the United States are often locally led;
Whereas 2015 also marks the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Soil 
        Conservation Act on April 27, 1935;
Whereas soils, as the foundation for agricultural production, essential 
        ecosystem functions, and food security, are key to sustaining life on 
        Earth;
Whereas soils and the science of soils contribute to improved water quality, 
        food safety and security, healthy ecosystems, and human health; and
Whereas soil, plant, animal, and human health are intricately linked: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the designation of an International Year of 
        Soils;
            (2) encourages the public to participate in activities that 
        celebrate the importance of soils to our current and future 
        well-being; and
            (3) supports conservation of the Nation's soils, through 
        landowner participation in the Conservation Reserve Program, 
        the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, the Conservation 
        Stewardship Program, the Agricultural Conservation Easement 
        Program, and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program as 
        authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985 as amended (16 
        U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), and the Small Watershed Rehabilitation 
        Program as authorized by the Watershed Protection and Flood 
        Prevention Act as amended (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), delivered 
        in partnership with local soil and water conservation 
        districts.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
