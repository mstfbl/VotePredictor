                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
             Honoring American veterans disabled for life.

Whereas the men and women serving in the United States Armed Forces have been 
        integral in shaping and developing American liberty;
Whereas the members of the Armed Forces make great sacrifices to preserve our 
        ideals and perpetuate freedom and democracy at home and abroad;
Whereas many members of the Armed Forces incurred permanent wounds, illnesses, 
        and injuries as a direct consequence of their service in the Armed 
        Forces;
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes 3,600,000 veterans 
        currently living with service-connected disabilities;
Whereas many veterans are permanently disabled throughout their lives and, in 
        many cases, must rely on the support of their families and friends when 
        these visible and invisible burdens become too much to bear alone;
Whereas in recognition of the service and sacrifice of the Nation's veterans, 
        Congress approved the construction of the American Veterans Disabled for 
        Life Memorial in the District of Columbia; and
Whereas the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial was dedicated on 
        October 5, 2014, to serve as a permanent reminder of those who were not 
        lost to war, but were left with permanent disabilities as a result of 
        their military service: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress honors American veterans disabled for life and expresses 
appreciation to the men and women left permanently wounded, ill, or 
injured as a result of their service in the Armed Forces.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
