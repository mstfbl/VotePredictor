                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           November 18, 2015

 Mr. Meadows submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was 
  referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and in addition to the 
   Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, for a period to be 
subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration 
  of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Congress regarding the treatment of State 
    Governors who have made a determination with respect to Syrian 
                               refugees.

Whereas a Governor is the chief executive officer of their State; and
Whereas the Federal Government should not be able to override a Governor's 
        decision with respect to refugees: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That in the case of a Governor requesting that Syrian refugees not be 
resettled in their State (whether temporarily or permanently), no 
Federal official should take any adverse action against, or withhold 
funds from, the State, and no Federal official should take any other 
action designed to persuade or entice the Governor to reverse such a 
request.
