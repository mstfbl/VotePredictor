                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that female athletes be paid the same 
 as their male counterparts and organizers of world class competitions 
             actively take part in combating the wage gap.

Whereas the 2015 Women's World Cup final was the most-watched soccer game in the 
        history of the United States;
Whereas with the United States victory, the women's national team became the 
        first three-time champions of the Women's World Cup; and
Whereas the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) awarded 
        $2,000,000 to the United States women for winning the 2015 Women's World 
        Cup and $35,000,000 to the 2014 Men's World Cup winners, Germany, 18 
        times larger than the women's award: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that female athletes should be paid 
the same as their male counterparts and organizers of world class 
competitions actively take part in combating the wage gap.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
