  Recognizing the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the United 
                                Nations.

Whereas June 26, 2015, marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the 
        United Nations;
Whereas, on June 26, 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was signed in San 
        Francisco at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on 
        International Organization, and came into force on October 24, 1945;
Whereas, on September 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the cornerstone for 
        modern day human rights;
Whereas in September 1960, 17 newly independent states, including 16 from 
        Africa, joined the United Nations, marking the biggest increase in 
        membership in any one year;
Whereas the United Nations has greatly contributed to international peace and 
        security;
Whereas the United Nations has provided a forum for the achievement of 
        international cooperation to address international economic, social, 
        cultural, and humanitarian problems, including promoting cooperation on 
        climate change, supporting human rights, and combating human 
        trafficking;
Whereas since 1948, the United Nations has deployed 71 peacekeeping and 
        observation missions in some of the world's most complex regions and 
        countries, including in Cambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, 
        Liberia, Kosovo, Mozambique, Namibia, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste;
Whereas United Nations peacekeeping missions have been charged with mandates 
        such as preventing the outbreak of conflict or the spill-over of 
        conflict across borders, stabilizing conflict situations after a cease-
        fire, assisting in the implementation of comprehensive peace agreements, 
        and leading countries or territories through a transition to stable 
        government;
Whereas in 2006, under the leadership of the United Nations, member states 
        adopted the first-ever global strategy to counter terrorism and 
        subsequently other global agreements, including treaties against 
        hostage-taking, aircraft hijacking, terrorism bombings, and terrorism 
        financing;
Whereas the United Nations has provided electoral assistance to more than 100 
        countries and helped facilitate the transition to democracy in these 
        countries, observing landmark elections in Cambodia, El Salvador, South 
        Africa, Mozambique, Timor-Leste, Liberia, Iraq, Nepal, and Sierra Leone;
Whereas the United Nations has made significant progress towards achieving the 
        eight Millennium Development Goals that were established following the 
        Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000, and is on track to 
        adopt the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 that 
        require member states to commit to eradicating extreme poverty, fighting 
        inequality, empowering women and girls, protecting natural resources, 
        improving governance, and encouraging sustainable and inclusive economic 
        growth;
Whereas the United Nations has played a critical role in improving global public 
        health, including through the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/
        AIDS;
Whereas the United Nations World Food Program reaches more than 80,000,000 
        people in 75 countries annually;
Whereas today, with global population displacement at the highest level recorded 
        since World War II, the World Food Program, together with the United 
        Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other United Nations 
        agencies, is feeding, clothing, and sheltering millions from Syria to 
        Iraq to the Central African Republic and beyond;
Whereas United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has implemented key 
        reforms, and continues to be committed to instituting necessary reforms 
        to improve the effectiveness of the United Nations and strengthen 
        oversight;
Whereas the United Nations remains an indispensable partner for the United 
        States as the United States Congress works to protect our national 
        security and foreign policy interests around the world;
Whereas the United Nations conducts business with numerous United States 
        corporations and organizations and in 2014 awarded United States 
        businesses with $555,500,000 in contracts;
Whereas these contracts were executed in 30 States and more than 100 cities and 
        communities, benefitting hundreds of Americans who work to provide the 
        United Nations a range of critical goods and services, including 
        telecommunications, construction, food production, and military 
        supplies; and
Whereas United States participation and leadership in the United Nations is 
        essential to securing United States interests in international peace and 
        security: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the establishment of 
        the United Nations;
            (2) recognizes the United Nations for the critical role it 
        plays in maintaining international peace and security;
            (3) applauds the United Nations for its leadership and 
        ongoing efforts in addressing global health crises, including 
        the global fight against HIV/AIDS;
            (4) applauds the United Nations for its response to 
        unprecedented humanitarian crises, which resulted in staggering 
        escalation of displacements in countries such as Syria, Iraq, 
        South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, Liberia, and Cote d'Ivoire;
            (5) commends the United Nations for its commitment to 
        eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; and
            (6) urges the President to issue a proclamation calling on 
        the people of the United States to observe the 70th anniversary 
        of the establishment of the United Nations with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities.
