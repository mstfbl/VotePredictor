 TITLE V--ESTIMATES OF DIRECT SPENDING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

SEC. 501. DIRECT SPENDING.

    (a) Means-Tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the 
        following:
                    (A) For means-tested direct spending, the average 
                rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 
                10-year period preceding fiscal year 2017 is 7.3 
                percent.
                    (B) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated 
                average rate of growth in the total level of outlays 
                during the 10-year period beginning with fiscal year 
                2017 is 4.3 percent under current law.
            (2) Proposed reforms.--The following reforms are proposed 
        under this concurrent resolution by the House of 
        Representatives for means-tested direct spending:
                    (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic 
                President reformed welfare by limiting the duration of 
                benefits, giving States more control over the program, 
                and helping recipients find work. In the 5 years 
                following passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare 
                caseloads fell, and workers' wages increased. This 
                concurrent resolution assumes the enactment of 
                proposals to reduce poverty and increase opportunity 
                and upward mobility for struggling Americans on the 
                road to personal and financial independence. Based on 
                the successful welfare reforms of the 1990s, these 
                proposals would improve work requirements and provide 
                flexible funding for States to help those most in need 
                find gainful employment, escape poverty, and move up 
                the economic ladder.
                    (B) For Medicaid, this concurrent resolution is 
                predicated on a framework proposed by the chairs of the 
                committees of jurisdiction of the House of 
                Representatives, to modernize and improve the program 
                while increasing State flexibility and protecting the 
                most vulnerable populations. This concurrent resolution 
                also assumes the repeal of the Medicaid expansions in 
                the President's health care law.
    (b) Nonmeans-Tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the 
        following:
                    (A) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the 
                average rate of growth in the total level of outlays 
                during the 10-year period preceding fiscal year 2017 is 
                5.1 percent.
                    (B) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the 
                estimated average rate of growth in the total level of 
                outlays during the 10-year period beginning with fiscal 
                year 2017 is 5.5 percent under current law.
            (2) Proposed reforms.--For Medicare, this concurrent 
        resolution advances policies to put seniors, not the Federal 
        Government, in control of their health care decisions. Putting 
        seniors in charge of how their health care dollars are spent 
        will encourage providers to compete against each other on price 
        and quality. Improvements to Medicare are necessary to extend 
        the life of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and 
        protect the program for future generations.

      TITLE VI--POLICY STATEMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

SEC. 601. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEVELOPING A BOLD AGENDA.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Speaker 
        of the House of Representatives, has called for a bold, pro-
        growth agenda to reestablish a confident America.
            (2) Today's challenges require solutions based on the 
        principles that have served as the cornerstone of American 
        strength, free enterprise, compassion, and exceptionalism.
            (3) On February 4, 2016, the Speaker announced the 
        formation of 6 task forces. Each task force will submit 
        recommendations in the following areas:
                    (A) National security.--This task force is 
                responsible for developing an overarching strategy and 
                the required military capabilities to confront 21st 
                century national security threats.
                    (B) Tax reform.--This task force will seek to 
                create jobs, grow the economy, and raise wages by 
                reducing tax rates, removing special interest 
                exceptions, and making the tax code simpler and fairer.
                    (C) Reducing regulatory burdens.--This task force 
                is charged with reducing bureaucracy in the regulatory 
                system, facilitating investment and productivity, 
                constructing infrastructure, and removing regulatory 
                obstacles on small businesses and employers. These 
                goals will be achieved while retaining protections for 
                the environment, public safety, and consumer interests.
                    (D) Health care reform.--This task force will 
                review appropriate methods to repeal and replace 
                Obamacare with a patient-centered system giving 
                patients more choice and control, increasing quality, 
                and reducing costs.
                    (E) Poverty, opportunity, and upward mobility.--
                This task force will identify ways to strengthen the 
                safety net and reform educational programs to make them 
                more effective and accountable, help people move from 
                welfare to work, and empower productive lives.
                    (F) Restoring constitutional authority.--This task 
                force will strive to reclaim power ceded to the 
                executive branch by reforming the rulemaking process, 
                checking agency authority, exercising the power of the 
                purse, and enhancing congressional oversight.
            (4) This concurrent resolution promotes and advances an 
        agenda to address the Nation's challenges.
    (b) Policy on Developing a Bold Agenda.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that the appropriate committees of jurisdiction 
in the House should consider in the 115th Congress recommendations 
developed by the Speaker's task forces on health care reform; reducing 
regulatory burdens; poverty, opportunity, and upward mobility; national 
security; tax reform; and restoring constitutional authority.

SEC. 602. POLICY STATEMENT ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Government will collect approximately $3.4 trillion 
        in taxes, but spend more than $3.9 trillion to maintain its 
        operations, borrowing 14 cents of every Federal dollar spent.
            (2) At the end of 2015, the national debt of the United 
        States was more than $18.9 trillion.
            (3) A majority of States have petitioned the Government to 
        hold a constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget 
        amendment to the Constitution.
            (4) Forty nine States have fiscal limitations in their 
        State constitutions, including the requirement to annually 
        balance the budget.
            (5) Numerous balanced budget amendment proposals have been 
        introduced on a bipartisan basis in the House. Currently in the 
        114th Congress, 17 joint resolutions proposing a balanced 
        budget amendment have been introduced, including a resolution 
        offered by Representative Dave Brat of Virginia and a 
        resolution offered by Representative Tom McClintock of 
        California.
            (6) In the 111th Congress, the House considered H. J. Res. 
        2, sponsored by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, 
        although it received 262 aye votes, it did not receive the two-
        thirds required for passage.
            (7) In 1995, a balanced budget amendment to the 
        Constitution passed the House with bipartisan support, but 
        failed to pass by one vote in the United States Senate.
            (8) Four States, including Georgia, Alaska, Mississippi, 
        and North Dakota, have agreed to the Compact for a Balanced 
        Budget, which is seeking to amend the Constitution to require a 
        balanced budget through an Article V convention by April 12, 
        2021.
    (b) Policy on a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment.--It is 
the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should propose a 
balanced budget constitutional amendment for ratification by the 
States.

SEC. 603. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORMING THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET 
              PROCESS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
        Control Act of 1974 was the first step toward restoring 
        constitutionally endowed legislative responsibility over 
        fundamental budget decision making.
            (2) The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 specifically set 
        forth its purposes in section 2. It was designed to--
                    (A) establish congressional control over the budget 
                process;
                    (B) provide for annual congressional determination 
                of a level of taxes and spending;
                    (C) set important national budget priorities; and
                    (D) find methods to facilitate the access of 
                Members of Congress to the most accurate, objective, 
                and high-quality information available to assist them 
                in discharging their duties.
            (3) However, the congressional budget process has neither 
        constrained spending nor inhibited the expansion of Government. 
        The growth of the Government, primarily through a multiplicity 
        of mandatory programs and other forms of direct spending, has 
        largely been financed through borrowing and high tax rates.
            (4) The enforcement of the current budget process, 
        including congressional points of order and statutory spending 
        limits, have been too often waived or circumvented. This 
        contributes to a lack of accountability, which has led to broad 
        agreement that reforming the system is a high necessity.
    (b) Policy on Reforming the Congressional Budget Process.--It is 
the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should--
            (1) restructure the fundamental procedures of budget 
        decision making;
            (2) reassert congressional power over spending and revenue, 
        restore the balance of power between Congress and the President 
        as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 intended, and attain 
        the maximum level of accountability for budget decisions 
        through efficient and rigorous enforcement of budget rules;
            (3) improve incentives for lawmakers to budget as intended 
        by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, especially by adopting 
        an annual budget resolution;
            (4) encourage more effective control over spending, 
        especially currently uncontrolled direct spending;
            (5) revise the methodology used in developing the baseline, 
        which is intended to reflect an objective projection of the 
        budgetary effects of current laws and policies for future 
        fiscal years, by removing any tendency toward assuming higher 
        spending levels;
            (6) promote efficient and timely budget actions to ensure 
        lawmakers complete their budget actions before the start of the 
        new fiscal year;
            (7) provide access to the best analysis of economic 
        conditions available and increase awareness of how fiscal 
        policy directly impacts economic growth and job creation;
            (8) eliminate the complexity of the budget process and the 
        biases that favor higher spending;
            (9) include procedures that treat extensions of current tax 
        laws on a comparable basis to the extension of mandatory 
        programs; and
            (10) require procedures that make the budgetary effects of 
        Government policies on individual taxpayers more apparent, such 
        as requiring the President's annual budget submission to 
        Congress provide an estimate of the pro rated share of any 
        projected debt for the current fiscal year to any individual 
        who files an income tax return.
    (c) Legislation.--The Committee on the Budget of the House intends 
to draft legislation during the 114th Congress that rewrites the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to fulfill the 
goals of making the congressional budget process more effective in 
ensuring taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and efficiently. Such 
legislation shall--
            (1) attain greater simplicity without sacrificing the rigor 
        required to address--
                    (A) the complex issues of the domestic and world 
                economy;
                    (B) national security responsibilities; and
                    (C) the appropriate roles of rulemaking and 
                statutory enforcement mechanisms;
            (2) establish a new structure that assures the 
        congressional role in the budget process is applied 
        consistently without reliance on reactive legislating;
            (3) improve the elements of the current budget process that 
        have fulfilled the original purposes of the Congressional 
        Budget Act of 1974; and
            (4) rebuild the foundation of the budget process to provide 
        a solid basis from which additional reforms may be developed.

SEC. 604. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Although the United States economy technically emerged 
        from recession nearly 7 years ago, the subsequent recovery has 
        felt more like a malaise than a rebound. Real gross domestic 
        product (GDP) growth since 2010 has averaged just over 2 
        percent annually, well below the 3 percent historical trend 
        rate of growth in the United States. The Nation remains in the 
        midst of the weakest economic recovery of the modern era. 
        Sluggish economic growth has also contributed to the country's 
        fiscal woes because revenue levels are lower than they would 
        otherwise be while Government spending (including welfare and 
        income-support programs) is higher. There is dire need for 
        policies that will initiate higher rates of economic growth and 
        greater, higher-quality job opportunities.
            (2) Even more disturbing, estimates of future economic 
        growth have been falling in recent years. In 2010, the 
        Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expected real GDP to grow by 
        a relatively brisk 3 percent annual average over the budget 
        window. In its latest economic forecast, CBO expects growth to 
        average just 2.1 percent over the next decade. This anemic 
        growth rate is insufficient to increase job opportunities and 
        incomes to acceptable levels.
            (3) Although the overall trend of job gains has been solid 
        of late, other aspects of the labor market remain relatively 
        weak. For example--
                    (A) the labor force participation rate stands at 
                just 62.9 percent, down roughly 3 percentage points 
                since early 2009, and near its lowest level since 1978;
                    (B) long-term unemployment remains a problem, and 
                of the 7.8 million people who are currently unemployed, 
                slightly more than 2 million (28 percent) have been 
                unemployed for more than 6 months; and
                    (C) long-term unemployment erodes an individual's 
                job skills and detaches such individual from job 
                opportunities, and undermines the long-term productive 
                capacity of the economy.
            (4) Wage gains and income growth have been subpar for 
        middle-class Americans. Average hourly earnings of private-
        sector workers have increased by 2.4 percent over the past 
        year. Prior to the recession, growth in average hourly earnings 
        was tracking close to 4 percent. Similarly, average incomes 
        have remained flat in recent years. Real median household 
        income has declined by roughly $800 in 2014 to $53,657. This 
        represents a sharp fall of 6.5 percent, or $3,700, since 2007.
            (5) The unsustainable fiscal trajectory casts a shadow on 
        the country's economic outlook. Investors and businesses make 
        decisions on a prospective basis. They know that today's high 
        debt levels are simply tomorrow's tax hikes, interest rate 
        increases, or inflation--and they act accordingly. This debt 
        overhang, and the uncertainty it generates, can weigh on 
        growth, investment, and job creation.
            (6) Nearly all economists, including those at CBO, conclude 
        that reducing budget deficits (thereby bending the curve on 
        debt levels) is a net positive for economic growth over time.
            (7) In contrast, if the Government remains on the current 
        fiscal path, future generations will face even-higher debt 
        service costs, a decline in national savings, and a ``crowding 
        out'' of private investment. This dynamic will eventually lead 
        to a decline in economic output and a diminution in our 
        country's standard of living.
            (8) The key economic challenge is determining how to expand 
        the economic pie, not how best to divide up and redistribute a 
        shrinking pie.
            (9) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels 
        and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if 
        annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over 
        the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $327 billion.
    (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--It is the policy 
of this concurrent resolution to promote faster economic growth and job 
creation by embracing pro-growth policies, such as fundamental tax 
reform, that will help foster a stronger economy, greater 
opportunities, and more job creation. By putting the budget on a 
sustainable path, this concurrent resolution ends the debt-fueled 
uncertainty holding back job creators. Tax reform will put American 
businesses and workers in a better position to compete and thrive in 
the 21st century global economy. This concurrent resolution targets the 
regulatory red tape and cronyism that favor special interests. The 
reforms in this concurrent resolution serve as a means to the larger 
end of helping the economy grow and expanding opportunity for all 
Americans.

SEC. 605. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY BUDGETING AND REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Excessive Federal regulation--
                    (A) has hurt job creation, investment, wages, 
                competition, and economic growth, slowing the Nation's 
                recovery from the economic recession and harming 
                American households;
                    (B) operates as a regressive tax on poor and lower-
                income households;
                    (C) displaces workers into long-term unemployment 
                or lower-paying jobs;
                    (D) adversely affects small businesses, the primary 
                source of new jobs; and
                    (E) impedes the economic growth necessary to 
                provide sufficient funds to meet vital commitments and 
                reduce the Federal debt.
            (2) Federal agencies routinely fail to identify and 
        eliminate, minimize, or mitigate excess regulatory costs 
        through post-implementation assessments of their regulations.
            (3) The estimated cost of Federal regulations are as high 
        as $1.88 to $2.03 trillion per year.
            (4) The estimated annual level of Federal regulatory 
        costs--
                    (A) equals roughly $15,000 per United States 
                household, or 30 percent of average household income;
                    (B) exceeds both individual and corporate Federal 
                income rates; and
                    (C) exceeded 11 percent of United States gross 
                domestic product in 2015.
            (5) If regulatory costs represented an independent economy, 
        the estimated annual level of these costs would qualify as one 
        of the world's top 10 economies, ranking between India and 
        Russia, roughly equaling one-half of Germany's economy and 40 
        percent of Japan's economy.
            (6) Since President Obama's inauguration in 2009, the 
        administration has issued more than 556,000 pages of 
        regulations and accompanying documentation in the Federal 
        Register, including 81,910 pages in 2015.
            (7) Since 2009, the White House has imposed more than $728 
        billion in additional Federal regulatory costs, with over $100 
        billion in further costs proposed since the beginning of 2015.
            (8) The United States Code of Federal Regulations now 
        contains over 175,000 pages of regulations in 235 volumes.
            (9) Notwithstanding the size and growth of Federal 
        regulations, Congress lacks an effective mechanism to manage 
        the level of new Federal regulatory costs imposed each year. 
        Other nations, meanwhile, have successfully implemented the use 
        of regulatory budgeting to control excess regulation and 
        regulatory costs.
            (10) Federal regulatory agencies routinely fail to analyze 
        both the costs and benefits of new regulations.
            (11) While the Obama administration has routinely failed to 
        analyze both the costs and benefits of its new regulations, the 
        United States has experienced zero real wage growth since 2007.
            (12) While the Obama administration has sharply increased 
        Federal regulatory costs, it has produced the weakest recovery 
        from economic recession since World War II.
            (13) If the Obama administration had produced even an 
        average recovery, Americans would have six million more jobs. 
        Instead, labor force participation is near historic lows and 
        over 90 million Americans over the age of 16 are out of the 
        workforce.
            (14) Dodd-Frank (Public Law 111-203) alone has resulted in 
        more than $39.3 billion in regulatory compliance costs and has 
        imposed as much as 76.6 million hours of proposed and final 
        regulatory compliance paperwork on job creators.
            (15) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act has resulted 
        in 177.9 million annual hours of regulatory compliance 
        paperwork, $37.1 billion of regulatory compliance costs on the 
        private sector, and $13 billion in regulatory compliance costs 
        on the States.
            (16) Agencies impose costly regulations without relying on 
        sound science through the use of judicial consent decrees and 
        settlement agreements and the abuse of interim compliance costs 
        imposed on regulated entities that bring legal challenges 
        against newly promulgated regulations.
            (17) The highest regulatory costs come from rules issued by 
        the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Among major new and 
        proposed EPA regulations are those that would vastly expand 
        EPA's control of land use through Clean Water Act permitting 
        programs, commonly referred to as the Waters of the United 
        States (WOTUS) rule; limit development in counties in nearly 
        every State under Clean Air Act ozone regulations; and impose a 
        de-facto ban on new United States coal-fired power plants.
            (18) EPA's power plant rules exemplify the impact of 
        excessive regulation.
            (19) In June 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to cut carbon 
        pollution from the Nation's power plants. The proposed 
        standards are unachievable with current commercially available 
        technology, resulting in a de-facto ban on new coal-fired power 
        plants.
            (20) Coal-fired power plants provide roughly 40 percent of 
        the United States electricity at a low cost. Unfairly targeting 
        the coal industry with costly and unachievable regulations will 
        increase energy prices, disproportionately disadvantaging 
        energy-intensive industries like manufacturing and 
        construction. This will make life more difficult for millions 
        of low-income and middle class families already struggling to 
        pay their bills.
            (21) Three hundred thirty coal units are proposed for 
        retirement or conversion as a result of EPA regulations. 
        Combined with the defacto prohibition on new plants, these 
        retirements and conversions may further increase the cost of 
        electricity.
            (22) A recent study by Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., an 
        energy market analysis group, estimates the average energy bill 
        in West Virginia will rise $750 per household by 2020, due in 
        part to EPA regulations. West Virginia receives 95 percent of 
        its electricity from coal.
            (23) The Heritage Foundation found that a phase out of coal 
        would cost 600,000 jobs by the end of 2023, resulting in an 
        aggregate gross domestic product decrease of $2.23 trillion 
        over the entire period and reducing the income of a family of 4 
        by $1,200 per year. Of these jobs, 330,000 will come from the 
        manufacturing sector, with California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, 
        Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Indiana, North Carolina, 
        Wisconsin, and Georgia seeing the highest job losses.
    (b) Policy on Federal Regulatory Budgeting and Reform.--It is the 
policy of this concurrent resolution that the House should, in 
consultation with the public, consider legislation that--
            (1) promotes--
                    (A) economic growth, job creation, higher wages, 
                and increased investment by eliminating unnecessary red 
                tape and streamlining, simplifying and lowering the 
                costs of Federal regulations; and
                    (B) the adoption of least-cost regulatory 
                alternatives to meet the objectives of Federal 
                regulatory statutes;
            (2) protects--
                    (A) the poor and lower-income households from the 
                regressive effects of excessive regulation; and
                    (B) workers against the unnecessary elimination of 
                jobs and loss or reduction of wages;
            (3) requires--
                    (A) an annual, congressional regulatory budget that 
                establishes annual costs of regulations and allocates 
                these costs amongst Federal regulatory agencies;
                    (B) cost-benefit and regulatory impact analysis for 
                new regulations proposed and promulgated by all Federal 
                regulatory agencies;
                    (C) advance notice of proposed rulemaking and makes 
                evidentiary hearings available for critical disputed 
                issues in the development of new major regulations;
                    (D) congressional approval of all new major 
                regulations before the regulations can become 
                effective, ensuring that Congress can better prevent 
                the imposition of unsound costly new regulations; and
                    (E) post-implementation cost-benefit analysis of 
                all new major regulations on at least a decennial 
                basis, to ensure that regulations operate as intended 
                and impose no more costs than necessary;
            (4) strengthens--
                    (A) requirements to assure the use and disclosure 
                of sound science, including models, data, and other 
                evidentiary information in the development of new 
                regulations;
                    (B) transparency in regulatory development and 
                improves opportunities for hearings on disputed issues 
                in high-cost major rulemaking;
                    (C) requirements to avoid, minimize, and mitigate 
                significant adverse impacts of new major regulations on 
                small businesses, the primary source of new jobs;
                    (D) judicial review of legal, scientific, 
                technical, and cost-benefit determinations made by 
                Federal regulatory agencies to support the promulgation 
                of new regulations;
                    (E) protections against unnecessary or abusive 
                imposition of regulatory compliance costs during 
                litigation challenging the promulgation of new, high-
                cost major regulation;
                    (F) protections against the abuse of regulatory 
                consent decrees and settlement agreements to force the 
                unfair imposition of new regulations; and
                    (G) protections against the abuse of interim 
                rulemaking;
            (5) reduces--
                    (A) regulatory barriers to entry into markets and 
                other regulatory impediments to competition and 
                innovation; and
                    (B) the imposition of new Federal regulation that 
                duplicates, overlaps or conflicts with State, local, 
                and Tribal regulation or that impose unfunded mandates 
                on State, local, and Tribal governments; and
            (6) eliminates the abuse of guidance to evade legal 
        requirements applicable to the development and promulgation of 
        new regulations.

SEC. 606. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and 
        promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States 
        tax code fails on all 3 counts: it is complex, unfair, and 
        inefficient. The tax code's complexity distorts decisions to 
        work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic growth, 
        lower wages, and less job creation.
            (2) Standard economic theory holds that high marginal tax 
        rates lessen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which 
        reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic 
        output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher 
        marginal tax rates.
            (3) Roughly half of United States active business income 
        and half of private sector employment are derived from business 
        entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole 
        proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, 
        meaning the income is taxed at individual rates rather than 
        corporate rates. Small businesses, in particular, tend to 
        choose this form for Federal tax purposes, and the highest 
        Federal rate on such small business income can reach nearly 45 
        percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires 
        lowering marginal rates on these pass-through entities.
            (4) The top United States corporate income tax rate 
        (including Federal, State, and local taxes) is slightly more 
        than 39 percent, the highest rate in the industrialized world. 
        Tax rates this high suppress wages, discourage investment and 
        job creation, distort business activity, and put American 
        businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign 
        competitors.
            (5) By deterring potential investment, the United States 
        corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The 
        United States tax rate differential fosters a variety of 
        complicated multinational corporate practices intended to avoid 
        the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax base offshore, 
        destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate revenue.
            (6) Recent and coming developments in the global arena, 
        specifically the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) 
        project recommendations, heighten the importance of the need to 
        reform and modernize our international tax system so that 
        American businesses and workers are not disadvantaged.
            (7) The ``world-wide'' structure of United States 
        international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United 
        States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive 
        disadvantage with competitors that have more competitive 
        international tax systems.
            (8) Reforming the tax code would boost the competitiveness 
        of United States companies operating abroad and significantly 
        reduce tax avoidance.
            (9) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through 
        lower wages, consumers in higher prices, and investors in 
        diminished returns.
            (10) Increasing taxes to raise revenue and meet out-of-
        control spending would sink the economy and Americans' ability 
        to save for their children's education and retirement.
            (11) Closing tax loopholes to finance higher spending does 
        not constitute fundamental tax reform.
            (12) Tax reform should curb or eliminate loopholes and use 
        those savings to lower tax rates across the board, not to fund 
        more wasteful Government spending. Washington has a spending 
        problem, not a revenue problem.
            (13) Many economists believe that fundamental tax reform, 
        including a broader tax base and lower tax rates, would lead to 
        greater labor supply and increased investment, which would have 
        a positive impact on total national output.
    (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution that Congress should enact legislation to comprehensively 
reform the tax code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, 
increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, and workers 
that--
            (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American 
        families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and 
        resources necessary to comply with tax laws;
            (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals and 
        consolidates the current seven individual income tax brackets 
        into fewer brackets;
            (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;
            (4) reduces the corporate tax rate; and
            (5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system 
        of international taxation.

SEC. 607. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to 
        the United States economy and beneficial to American workers 
        and consumers. The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 
        billion of United States exports support more than 5,000 jobs 
        here at home.
            (2) The United States can increase economic opportunities 
        for American workers and businesses through the elimination of 
        foreign trade barriers to United States goods and services.
            (3) Trade agreements have saved the average American family 
        of four more than $10,000 per year as a result of lower duties. 
        Trade agreements also lower the cost of manufacturing inputs by 
        removing duties.
            (4) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a 
        level playing field, they can excel and surpass international 
        competition.
            (5) When negotiating trade agreements, United States laws 
        on Intellectual Property (IP) protection should be used as a 
        benchmark for establishing global IP frameworks. Strong IP 
        protections have significantly contributed to the United 
        States' status as a world leader in innovation across sectors 
        (including in the development of life-saving biologic 
        medicines). The data protections afforded to biologics under 
        Federal law, including 12 years of data protection, allow 
        continued development of pioneering medicines to benefit 
        patients both in the United States and abroad. To maintain the 
        cycle of innovation and achieve 21st century trade agreements, 
        it is vital that our negotiators insist on the highest 
        standards for IP protections.
    (b) Policy on Trade.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution--
            (1) to pursue international trade, global commerce, and a 
        modern and competitive tax system to promote domestic job 
        creation;
            (2) that the United States should continue to seek 
        increased economic opportunities for American workers and 
        businesses through high-standard trade agreements that satisfy 
        negotiating objectives, including--
                    (A) the expansion of trade opportunities;
                    (B) adherence to trade agreements and rules by the 
                United States and its trading partners, and
                    (C) the elimination of foreign trade barriers to 
                United States goods and services by opening new markets 
                and enforcing United States rights; and
            (3) that any trade agreement entered into on behalf of the 
        United States should reflect the negotiating objectives and 
        adhere to the provisions requiring improved consultation with 
        Congress.

SEC. 608. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with 
        disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since 
        enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg of the 
        ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes 
        employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.
            (2) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a 
        larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, 
        reforms should take into consideration the need to protect 
        lower income Americans' retirement security.
            (3) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly 
        recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
        challenges be addressed soon. The financial condition of Social 
        Security and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social 
        Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced each year 
        without reform. For example--
                    (A) in 2022, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
                will be exhausted and program revenues will be unable 
                to pay scheduled benefits;
                    (B) in 2034, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and 
                Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program 
                revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits; and
                    (C) with the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2034, 
                benefits will be cut nearly 21 percent across the 
                board, devastating those currently in or near 
                retirement and those who rely on Social Security the 
                most.
            (4) The recession and continued low economic growth have 
        exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. 
        The most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections 
        find that Social Security will run cash deficits of more than 
        $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years.
            (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential 
        income safety net for those with disabilities and their 
        families. According to CBO, between 1970 and 2012 the number of 
        disabled workers and their dependent family members receiving 
        disability benefits has increased by more than 300 percent from 
        2.7 million to over 10.9 million. This increase is not due 
        strictly to population growth or decreases in health. Scholars 
        David Autor and Mark Duggan have found that the increase in 
        individuals on disability does not reflect a decrease in self-
        reported health. CBO attributes program growth to changes in 
        demographics and the composition of the labor force as well as 
        Federal policies.
            (6) In the past, Social Security has been reformed on a 
        bipartisan basis, most notably by the ``Greenspan Commission'', 
        which helped address Social Security shortfalls for more than a 
        generation.
            (7) Americans deserve action by the President and Congress 
        to preserve and strengthen Social Security to ensure that 
        Social Security remains a critical part of the safety net.
    (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution that the House should work on a bipartisan basis to make 
Social Security sustainably solvent. This concurrent resolution 
assumes, under a reform trigger, that--
            (1) if in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal 
        Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal 
        Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report 
        determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social 
        Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of 
        the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, 
        the Board of Trustees should, no later than September 30 of the 
        same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations for 
        statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year 
        actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th 
        year, and any recommendations provided to the President must be 
        agreed upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of Trustees;
            (2) not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in 
        which the Board of Trustees submit their recommendations, the 
        President should promptly submit implementing legislation to 
        both Houses of Congress including recommendations necessary to 
        achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive 
        annual balance in the 75th year, and the majority leader of the 
        Senate and the majority leader of the House should introduce 
        the President's legislation upon receipt;
            (3) within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, 
        the committees of jurisdiction should report a bill, which 
        should be considered by the House or Senate under expedited 
        procedures; and
            (4) legislation submitted by the President should--
                    (A) protect those in or near retirement;
                    (B) preserve the safety net for those who count on 
                Social Security the most, including those with 
                disabilities and survivors;
                    (C) improve fairness for participants;
                    (D) reduce the burden on and provide certainty for 
                future generations; and
                    (E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance 
                program while addressing the needs of those with 
                disabilities today and improving the determination 
                process.
    (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that Congress and the President should enact 
legislation on a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability Insurance 
program prior to its insolvency in 2022 and should not raid the Social 
Security retirement system without reforms to the Disability Insurance 
system. This concurrent resolution assumes reform that--
            (1) ensures benefits continue to be paid to individuals 
        with disabilities and their family members who rely on them;
            (2) prevents an 11 percent across-the-board benefit cut;
            (3) improves the Disability Insurance program; and
            (4) promotes opportunity for those trying to return to 
        work.
    (d) Policy on Social Security Solvency.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that any legislation Congress considers to 
improve the solvency of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund must also 
improve the long-term solvency of the combined Old Age and Survivors 
Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund.

SEC. 609. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPEALING THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW 
              AND PROMOTING REAL HEALTH CARE REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The President's health care law put Washington's 
        priorities before those of patients'. The Affordable Care Act 
        (ACA) has failed to reduce health care premiums as promised. 
        Instead, the law mandated benefits and coverage levels, denying 
        patients the opportunity to choose the type of coverage that 
        best suits their health needs and driving up health coverage 
        costs. A typical family's health care premiums were supposed to 
        decline by $2,500; instead, average premiums have increased by 
        $3,775. A recent study conducted by the nonpartisan 
        Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates premiums to 
        continue rising over the next decade, projecting an average 
        increase of 8 percent per year between 2016 and 2018, and 
        increasing by nearly 60 percent by 2026.
            (2) The President pledged, ``If you like your health care 
        plan, you can keep your health care plan.'' Instead, CBO now 
        estimates 7 million Americans will lose employment-based health 
        coverage due to the President's health care law, further 
        limiting patient choice.
            (3) Then-Speaker of the House Pelosi stated that the 
        President's health care law would create 4 million jobs over 
        the life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. 
        Instead, CBO estimates that by 2025 Obamacare will reduce the 
        number of hours worked by approximately 2 million full-time 
        equivalent workers, mostly lower wage workers, compared with 
        what would have occurred in the absence of the law. 
        Additionally, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason 
        University estimates that Obamacare will reduce employment by 
        up to 3 percent, or about 4 million full-time equivalent 
        workers.
            (4) The President has charged the Independent Payment 
        Advisory Board, a panel of unelected bureaucrats, with cutting 
        Medicare by an additional $36.4 billion over the next 10 years.
            (5) Since the ACA was signed into law, the administration 
        has repeatedly failed to implement it as written. The 
        President's unilateral actions have resulted in 43 changes, 
        delays, and exemptions. The President has signed into law 
        another 24 changes made by Congress. The Supreme Court struck 
        down the forced expansion of Medicaid; ruled the individual 
        ``mandate'' could only be characterized as a tax to remain 
        constitutional; and rejected the requirement that closely held 
        companies provide health insurance to their employees even if 
        it violates the companies' religious beliefs. More than 5 years 
        after enactment, the Supreme Court continues to evaluate the 
        legality of how the President's administration has implemented 
        the law. All of these changes prove the folly of the underlying 
        law; health care in the United States cannot be run from a 
        centralized bureaucracy.
            (6) The President's health care law is unaffordable, 
        intrusive, overreaching, destructive, and unworkable. Its 
        complex structure of subsidies, mandates, and penalties 
        perversely impact individuals, married couples, and families. 
        Those who previously had insurance along with those who did not 
        have been funneled into a new system that is providing less 
        access to doctors and treatments. Millions of Americans have 
        been added to a broken Medicaid system that is incapable of 
        providing the care promised. Cuts made to Medicare to fund a 
        new entitlement are undermining the health security of seniors. 
        Taxes and mandates are distorting the insurance market and 
        harming the broader economy, resulting in fewer jobs and less 
        opportunity. By design, the President's law puts Washington at 
        the center of our health care system, at the expense of 
        patients, families, physicians, and businesses. The ACA should 
        be fully repealed, allowing for real patient-centered health 
        care reform that puts patients first, not Washington, DC.
    (b) Policy on Promoting Real Health Care Reform.--It is the policy 
of this concurrent resolution that the President's health care law 
should be fully repealed and real health care reform should be enacted 
to enhance affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation, choices, 
and responsiveness in coverage for all Americans. Real health care 
reform should put patients, families, and doctors in charge, not 
Washington, DC, and encourage increased competition and transparency. 
Under the President's health care law, Government controls Americans' 
health care choices. Patient-centered reform should be enacted in 
accordance with the following principles:
            (1) Affordability.--Real reform should ensure that all 
        Americans, no matter their age, income, or health status, can 
        afford health care coverage. Currently, those who receive 
        insurance through an employer receive assistance through the 
        tax code, while those purchasing insurance on their own do not 
        receive the same benefit. Individuals should not be priced out 
        of the health insurance market due to pre-existing conditions. 
        Policies should provide protections for patients with pre-
        existing conditions to guarantee affordable coverage, reward 
        those who maintain health coverage, create more equity between 
        benefits offered through employers to individuals and families 
        purchasing coverage on their own, and give States, who are 
        better equipped to respond to the needs of their communities, 
        more control over insurance regulation. Individuals should also 
        be allowed to voluntarily join together to pool risk through 
        mechanisms such as Individual Health Pools and Small Employer 
        Membership Associations to gain the purchasing power of 
        thousands.
            (2) Accessability.--Instead of Washington dictating the 
        ways Americans cannot use their health insurance, reforms 
        should make health coverage more portable. Individuals should 
        be able to own their insurance and have it follow them in and 
        out of jobs throughout their career. Small business owners 
        should be permitted to band together across State lines through 
        their membership in bona fide trade or professional 
        associations to purchase health coverage for their families and 
        employees at a low cost. This will increase small businesses' 
        bargaining power, volume discounts, and administrative 
        efficiencies while giving them freedom from State-mandated 
        benefit packages. Also, insurers licensed to sell policies in 
        one State should be permitted to offer them to residents in any 
        other State, and consumers should be permitted to shop for 
        health insurance across State lines, as they are with other 
        insurance products online, by mail, by phone, or in 
        consultation with an insurance agent.
            (3) Quality.--Incentives for providers to deliver high-
        quality, responsive, and coordinated care will promote better 
        patient outcomes and drive down health care costs. 
        Additionally, reforms that restore the patient-physician 
        relationship by reducing administrative burdens will promote 
        quality coverage for all Americans and allow physicians to do 
        what they do best--care for patients. Reforms should also 
        empower the patient by creating a marketplace for health care, 
        allowing providers to compete on cost and quality for the 
        patients' choice.
            (4) Choices.--Individuals and families should be free to 
        secure the health care coverage that best meets their needs, 
        rather than instituting one-size-fits-all directives from 
        Federal bureaucracies such as the Internal Revenue Service, the 
        Department of Health and Human Services, and the Independent 
        Payment Advisory Board. Patient-centered health care should 
        enhance, not diminish coverage options for individuals. 
        Additionally, patients are often unable to compare costs for 
        health care goods and services due to a lack of price 
        transparency. The inability of consumers to compare costs 
        distorts the health marketplace at the expense of patients by 
        denying them the opportunity to make informed care decisions, 
        further reducing competition and only serving select special 
        interests.
            (5) Innovation.--Instead of stifling health care 
        innovation, a reformed health care system should encourage 
        research, development, and innovation. New technologies provide 
        patients and providers with instant connection and access to 
        life saving diagnostic tools and treatments. Groundbreaking 
        applications, software, and devices not only enhance the 
        delivery of health care to be more effective and efficient, but 
        also less costly. Federal regulations, however, too often slow 
        and prevent widespread adoption of these medical advancements 
        and hinder the transformation of America's health delivery 
        system.
            (6) Responsiveness.--Reform should return authority to 
        States where possible to make the system more responsive to 
        patients and their needs. Instead of tying States' hands with 
        Federal requirements for Medicaid, the Government should return 
        control over to the States. Not only does the current Medicaid 
        program drive up Federal debt and threaten to bankrupt State 
        budgets, but States are better positioned to provide quality 
        and affordable care to those who are eligible for the program 
        and to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. 
        Beneficiary choices in the State Children's Health Insurance 
        Program (SCHIP) and Medicaid should be improved. States should 
        offer private insurance, Health Savings Accounts, and other 
        competitive insurance options to their Medicaid and SCHIP 
        beneficiaries, but should not require enrollment.
            (7) Reforms.--Reforms should prevent lawsuit abuse and curb 
        the practice of defensive medicine, which significantly 
        increase health care costs. The burden of proof in medical 
        malpractice cases should be based on compliance with best 
        practice guidelines, and States should be free to implement 
        those policies to best suit their needs.

SEC. 610. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
        their health security.
            (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
        that Congress address Medicare's long-term financial 
        challenges. Each year without reform, the financial condition 
        of Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in 
        or near retirement more pronounced. According to the Medicare 
        Trustees Report--
                    (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted in 2030 and unable to pay the full scheduled 
                benefits;
                    (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to increase 
                more than 50 percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 
                baby boomers reach retirement age each day;
                    (C) due to extended life spans, enrollees remain in 
                Medicare three times longer than at the outset of the 
                program five decades ago;
                    (D) notwithstanding the program's Trust Fund 
                arrangement, current workers' payroll tax contributions 
                pay for current Medicare beneficiaries;
                    (E) the number of workers supporting each 
                beneficiary continues to fall; in 1965, the ratio was 
                4.5 workers per beneficiary, and by 2030, when the baby 
                boom generation will have fully aged into the program, 
                the ratio will be only 2.3 workers per beneficiary;
                    (F) most Medicare beneficiaries receive about three 
                dollars in Medicare benefits for every one dollar paid 
                into the program;
                    (G) Medicare is growing faster than the economy at 
                a projected rate of 6 percent per year over the next 10 
                years; and
                    (H) by 2026, Medicare spending will reach nearly 
                $1.3 trillion, almost double the 2015 spending level of 
                $634 billion.
            (3) Failing to address Medicare's collapsing finances will 
        leave millions of American seniors without adequate health 
        security and younger generations burdened with having to pay 
        for these unsustainable spending levels.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution to save Medicare for those in or near retirement and 
strengthen the program for future beneficiaries.
    (c) Assumptions.--This concurrent resolution assumes transition to 
an improved Medicare program that ensures--
            (1) Medicare is preserved for current and future 
        beneficiaries;
            (2) future Medicare beneficiaries select, from competing 
        guaranteed health coverage options, a plan that best suits 
        their needs, with support from a defined contribution toward 
        their premiums;
            (3) traditional fee-for-service Medicare remains as a plan 
        option;
            (4) Medicare provides additional assistance for lower 
        income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks; and
            (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and 
        becomes solvent over the long term.

SEC. 611. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAL DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, DELIVERY, 
              AND INNOVATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) For decades, the Nation's commitment to the discovery, 
        development, and delivery of new treatments and cures has made 
        the United States the biomedical innovation capital of the 
        world, bringing life-saving drugs and devices to patients and 
        well over a million high-paying jobs to local communities.
            (2) Americans were responsible for the first of many 
        scientific discoveries, including creating the first vaccine 
        for polio and numerous other scientific and medical 
        breakthroughs that have improved and prolonged human health and 
        life for countless people in America and around the world.
            (3) The United States has led the way in early discovery 
        because of visionary and determined innovators throughout the 
        private and public sectors, including industry, academic 
        medical centers, and Federally funded activities, such as the 
        National Institutes of Health (NIH). United States leadership 
        is threatened, however, when other countries contribute more to 
        basic research from both public and private sources.
            (4) The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
        Development predicts that China, for example, will outspend the 
        United States in total research and development by the end of 
        the decade.
            (5) Federal policies should foster investment in health 
        care innovation. America should maintain its world leadership 
        in medical science by encouraging competition in the delivery 
        of cures and therapies to patients.
    (b) Policy on Medical Innovation.--This concurrent resolution calls 
for--
            (1) Congress to support the important work of medical 
        innovators throughout the country through continued strong 
        funding for the agencies that engage in life saving research 
        and development; and
            (2) Washington to unleash the power of innovation by 
        removing obstacles that impede the adoption of medical 
        technologies - the bureaucracy and red-tape in Washington too 
        often hold back medical innovation, increasing rather than 
        decreasing costs, and prevent new lifesaving treatments from 
        reaching patients.

SEC. 612. POLICY STATEMENT ON PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Nation's ability to respond quickly and effectively 
        to emergent health care threats must be a top priority.
            (2) Through international trade and travel, natural 
        geographic barriers are removed, increasing the likelihood and 
        speed of transmission for communicable diseases.
            (3) While the health care infrastructure enables rapid 
        response to domestic public health threats, the most effective 
        and efficient way to protect American lives from threats that 
        emerge overseas is to halt the spread of disease before it 
        reaches America's borders.
            (4) United States leadership in international public health 
        preparedness and response is far reaching. Multiple agencies 
        support activities to prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond 
        to emerging threats, as follows:
                    (A) The Department of Health and Human Services 
                coordinates with domestic agencies. For example--
                            (i) the Centers for Disease Control and 
                        Prevention serves as the first line of defense 
                        in global disease detection by providing 
                        domestic and international support through 
                        various activities, including coordinating 
                        technical assistance with partners worldwide in 
                        disease prevention and detection and providing 
                        a multitude of resources, including logistics, 
                        analytics, tracing of data and disease 
                        contacts, laboratory testing, health education, 
                        and more;
                            (ii) the National Institutes of Health 
                        conducts research activities for treatments and 
                        vaccines for infectious diseases; and
                            (iii) the Biomedical Advanced Research and 
                        Development Authority provides an integrated 
                        and systematic approach in developing and 
                        acquiring the necessary medical resources in a 
                        public health emergency.
                    (B) The United States Agency for International 
                Development assists other nations in building 
                infrastructure and health systems for surveillance, 
                identifying, and responding to infectious diseases.
                    (C) The Department of Defense maintains a 
                surveillance and response system, as well as a network 
                of laboratories, domestically and abroad, that support 
                surveillance and research and development.
            (5) Emerging infectious diseases are unpredictable and pose 
        a continuous threat. The United States must be vigilant and 
        prepared to act at home and abroad. For example--
                    (A) in 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
                was first identified, and before the disease was 
                contained, it spread to more than two dozen countries 
                in North and South America, Europe, and Asia;
                    (B) the H1N1 virus, a type of swine flu, caused a 
                global flu pandemic in 2009, killing thousands;
                    (C) in 2012, an outbreak of measles resulted in 
                approximately 122,000 deaths; a disease that was 
                declared to be eliminated from the United States in 
                2010;
                    (D) Ebola was identified in West Africa in March of 
                2014; due to the highly infectious nature of the 
                disease, at the peak of the outbreak transmission rates 
                reached as high as a thousand new cases per week and 
                resulted in approximately 28,000 cases and over 11,000 
                deaths; and
                    (E) on February 1, 2016, the World Health 
                Organization declared a ``Public Health Emergency of 
                International Concern'' due to potential health risks 
                posed by the Zika virus.
    (b) Policy on Public Health Preparedness.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that the House should, within available budgetary 
resources, provide continued support for research, prevention, and 
public health preparedness programs to ensure the Nation's ability to 
respond efficiently and effectively to potential public health threats.

SEC. 613. POLICY STATEMENT ON ADDRESSING THE OPIOID ABUSE EPIDEMIC.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Sixty-one percent of all drug overdose deaths in the 
        United States were related to opioids in 2014, primarily 
        prescription pain relievers and heroin. Prescription opioid 
        overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999, with 44 deaths 
        every day.
            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
        has found that people in rural counties are almost twice as 
        likely to overdose on prescription painkillers as those in 
        large cities.
            (3) One of the leading factors in the rise of opioid abuse 
        is considered to be the ready availability of prescription 
        painkillers:
                    (A) From 1999 to 2013, the sale of prescription 
                painkillers in the United States quadrupled.
                    (B) In 2012, there were enough opioids prescribed 
                for every adult in the United States to each have their 
                own one month's supply.
                    (C) Nearly 2 million Americans reported opioid 
                abuse or dependency in 2013.
            (4) According to the CDC, every day nearly 7,000 people are 
        treated in emergency departments for using opioids in a manner 
        other than as directed.
            (5) Prescription opioid abuse is also associated with a 
        rise in heroin use and overdoses:
                    (A) From 2002 to 2013, heroin use in the United 
                States nearly doubled, and heroin-related overdose 
                deaths nearly quadrupled.
                    (B) According to the CDC, ``past misuse of 
                prescription opioids is the strongest risk factor for 
                heroin initiation and use.''
    (b) Policy on Opioid Abuse.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution that combating opioid abuse, using available budgetary 
resources, is a high priority to assist those who are suffering from 
this tragic epidemic. Congress, in a bipartisan manner, should examine 
the Federal response to the opioid abuse crisis and support essential 
activities, including rehabilitation, to reduce and prevent substance 
abuse.

SEC. 614. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE 
              DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY.

    (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, 
        and wage growth.
            (2) Roughly 20 million students are enrolled in American 
        colleges and universities.
            (3) Over the past decade, tuition and fees have been 
        growing at an unsustainable rate. Between the 2005-2006 
        Academic Year and the 2015-2016 Academic Year, published 
        tuition and fees at--
                    (A) public 4-year colleges and universities 
                increased at an average rate of 3.4 percent per year 
                above the rate of inflation;
                    (B) public 2-year colleges and universities 
                increased at an average rate of 2.6 percent per year 
                above the rate of inflation; and
                    (C) private nonprofit 4-year colleges and 
                universities increased at an average rate of 2.4 
                percent per year above the rate of inflation.
            (4) Federal financial aid for higher education has 
        dramatically increased. The portion of the Federal student aid 
        portfolio composed of Direct Loans, Federal Family Education 
        Loans, and Perkins Loans with outstanding balances grew by 135 
        percent between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2015. This 
        increased spending has failed to make college more affordable.
            (5) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama 
        noted: ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; 
        we'll run out of money.''
            (6) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition 
        with ever-increasing debt. According to the Board of Governors 
        of the Federal Reserve System, total student debt now stands at 
        $1.3 trillion. This makes student loans the second largest 
        balance of consumer debt, after mortgage debt.
            (7) Students are carrying large debt loads. Too many 
        students fail to complete college or end up defaulting on their 
        loans due to high debt burdens and a weak economy and job 
        market.
            (8) The Pell Grant program is on an unsustainable funding 
        path. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the program 
        will experience a future multi-billion funding gap that is 
        predicted to increase in subsequent years in the current budget 
        window.
            (9) Failure to address these problems will jeopardize young 
        people's access to higher education because it will remain 
        unaffordable.
    (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--It is the policy of 
this concurrent resolution to address the root drivers of tuition 
inflation and promote college affordability by--
            (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need;
            (2) streamlining aid programs to increase their 
        effectiveness and make it easier for students and families to 
        assess their options for financing postsecondary education;
            (3) putting the Pell Grant program on a more stable path 
        and maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level of $5,815 in 
        each year of the budget window; and
            (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that 
        increase costs, limit access, and restrict innovative teaching, 
        particularly non-traditional models such as online course work 
        and competency-based learning.
    (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House finds the 
following:
            (1) 7.8 million Americans are currently unemployed.
            (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking 
        for work are stymied by a broken workforce development system 
        that fails to connect workers with assistance and employers 
        with trained personnel.
            (3) The House Committee on Education and the Workforce 
        successfully consolidated 15 job training programs in the 
        recently enacted Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
    (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution to build on the success of the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act by--
            (1) further streamlining and consolidating Federal job 
        training programs; and
            (2) empowering States with the flexibility to tailor 
        funding and programs to the specific needs of their workforce.

SEC. 615. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) For years, there has been serious concern regarding the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) bureaucratic mismanagement 
        and continuous failure to provide veterans timely access to 
        health care.
            (2) In 2015, for the first time, VA health care was added 
        to Government Accountability Office's (GAO) ``high-risk'' list, 
        due to mismanagement and oversight failures, which have 
        resulted in untimely and inefficient health care. According to 
        GAO, ``the absence of care and delays in providing care have 
        harmed veterans.''.
            (3) The VA's failure to provide timely and accessible 
        health care to our veterans is unacceptable. While Congress has 
        done its part for more than a decade by providing sufficient 
        funding for the VA, the administration has mismanaged these 
        resources, resulting in proven adverse effects on veterans and 
        their families.
    (b) Policy on the Department of Veterans Affairs.--It is the policy 
of this concurrent resolution that--
            (1) the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs continue its 
        oversight efforts to ensure the VA reassesses its core mission, 
        including--
                    (A) reducing the number of bureaucratic layers;
                    (B) reducing the number of senior and middle 
                managers;
                    (C) streamlining the disciplinary process;
                    (D) improving performance measure metrics;
                    (E) strengthening the administration and oversight 
                of contractors; and
                    (F) supporting opportunities for veterans to pursue 
                other viable options for their health care needs; and
            (2) the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the 
        Committee on the Budget should continue to closely monitor the 
        VA's progress to ensure VA resources are sufficient and 
        efficiently provided to veterans.

SEC. 616. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Current accounting methods fail to capture and present 
        in a compelling manner the full scope of the Government and its 
        fiscal situation.
            (2) Most fiscal analyses produced by the Congressional 
        Budget Office (CBO) are conducted over a 10-year time horizon. 
        The use of generational accounting or a longer time horizon 
        would provide a more complete picture of the Government's 
        fiscal situation.
            (3) The Federal budget currently accounts for most programs 
        on a cash accounting basis, which records revenue and expenses 
        when cash is actually paid or received. However, it accounts 
        for loan and loan guarantee programs on an accrual basis, which 
        records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
            (4) The Government Accountability Office has advised that 
        accrual accounting may provide a more accurate estimate of the 
        Government's liabilities than cash accounting for some 
        programs, specifically insurance programs.
            (5) Accrual accounting under the Federal Credit Reform Act 
        of 1990 (FCRA) understates the risk and thus the true cost of 
        some Federal programs, including loans and loan guarantees.
            (6) Fair value accounting better reflects the risk 
        associated with Federal loan and loan guarantee programs by 
        using a market based discount rate. CBO, for example, uses fair 
        value accounting to measure the cost of Fannie Mae and Freddie 
        Mac.
            (7) In comparing fair value accounting to FCRA, CBO has 
        concluded that ``adopting a fair-value approach would provide a 
        more comprehensive way to measure the costs of Federal credit 
        programs and would permit more level comparisons between those 
        costs and the costs of other forms of Federal assistance''.
            (8) The Treasury Department, when reporting the principal 
        financial statements of the United States entitled Balance 
        Sheet and Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position, 
        may omit some of the largest projected Government expenses, 
        including social insurance programs. The projected expenses of 
        these programs are reported by the Treasury Department in a 
        statement of Social Insurance and Statement of Changes in 
        Social Insurance Amounts.
            (9) This concurrent resolution directs CBO to estimate the 
        costs of credit programs on a fair value basis to fully capture 
        the risk associated with Federal credit programs.
    (b) Policy on Federal Accounting Methodologies.--It is the policy 
of this concurrent resolution that the House should, in consultation 
with CBO and other appropriate stakeholders, reform government-wide 
budget and accounting practices so Members and the public can better 
understand the fiscal situation of the United States and the options 
best suited to improving it. Such reforms may include the following:
            (1) Providing additional metrics to enhance our current 
        analysis by considering the Nation's fiscal situation 
        comprehensively, over an extended time horizon, and how it 
        affects Americans of various age cohorts.
            (2) Expanding the use of accrual accounting where 
        appropriate.
            (3) Accounting for certain Federal credit programs using 
        fair value accounting to better capture market risk.

SEC. 617. POLICY STATEMENT ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY AND WASTEFUL 
              SPENDING.

    (a) Findings on Reducing Unnecessary and Wasteful Spending.--The 
House finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has 
        identified dozens of examples of waste, duplication, and 
        overlap in Federal programs.
            (2) In its report to Congress on Government Efficiency and 
        Effectiveness, the Comptroller General has stated that 
        addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in 
        Federal programs could ``lead to tens of billions of dollars of 
        additional savings''.
            (3) From 2011 through 2014, the GAO issued reports showing 
        excessive duplication and redundancy in Federal programs 
        including--
                    (A) 209 Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
                Mathematics education programs in 13 different Federal 
                agencies at a cost of $3 billion annually;
                    (B) 200 overlapping Department of Justice grant 
                programs with an annual cost of $3.9 billion in 2010;
                    (C) 20 different Federal entities administer 160 
                housing programs and other forms of Federal assistance 
                for housing with a total cost of $170 billion in 2010;
                    (D) 17 separate Homeland Security preparedness 
                grant programs that spent $37 billion between fiscal 
                years 2002 and 2011;
                    (E) 14 grant and loan programs and 3 tax benefits 
                to reduce diesel emissions that obligated at least $1.4 
                billion between fiscal years 2007 and 2011;
                    (F) 94 separate initiatives run by 11 different 
                agencies to encourage ``green building'' in the private 
                sector;
                    (G) 23 agencies implemented approximately 670 
                renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010 at a 
                cost of nearly $15 billion; and
                    (H) 18 separate domestic food and nutrition 
                assistance programs across 4 agencies at a cost of $90 
                billion in fiscal year 2010.
            (4) The Government spends more than $80 billion each year 
        for approximately 1,400 information technology investments. GAO 
        has identified broad acquisition failures, waste, and 
        unnecessary duplication in the Government's information 
        technology infrastructure. Experts have estimated that 
        eliminating these problems could reduce costs by 25 percent or 
        $20 billion.
            (5) GAO has identified strategic sourcing as a potential 
        source of spending reductions. In 2011, GAO estimated that 
        saving 10 percent of total Federal procurement could generate 
        more than $50 billion in savings annually.
            (6) Federal agencies reported an estimated $125 billion in 
        improper payments in fiscal year 2014.
            (7) Under clause 2 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least one 
        hearing during each 120-day period following its establishment 
        on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government 
        programs.
    (b) Policy on Reducing Unnecessary and Wasteful Spending.--It is 
the policy of this concurrent resolution that--
            (1) each authorizing committee of the House should identify 
        duplicative programs and make recommendations as to which 
        programs should be reduced or eliminated in its annual Views 
        and Estimates submission to the Committee on the Budget;
            (2) the Committee on the Budget should aggressively 
        investigate reports of improper payments; and
            (3) Federal agencies should be held accountable for their 
        inability to reduce such inappropriate expenditures.

SEC. 618. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
              CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office 
        of Management and Budget, Federal agencies held $896 billion in 
        unobligated balances at the end of fiscal year 2015.
            (2) These funds comprise both discretionary appropriations 
        and authorizations of mandatory spending that remain available 
        for expenditure.
            (3) In many cases, agencies are provided appropriations 
        that remain indefinitely available for obligation.
            (4) The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the 
        Office of Management and Budget to make funds available to 
        agencies for obligation and prohibits the administration from 
        withholding or cancelling unobligated funds unless approved by 
        an Act of Congress.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
Unobligated Balances.--It is the policy of this concurrent resolution 
that--
            (1) greater congressional oversight is required to review 
        and identify potential savings from canceling unobligated 
        balances of funds that are no longer needed;
            (2) the appropriate committees in the House should identify 
        and review accounts with unobligated balances and rescind such 
        balances that would not impede or disrupt the fulfillment of 
        important Federal commitments;
            (3) the House, with the assistance of the Government 
        Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and appropriate 
        agencies, should continue to review unobligated balances and 
        identify savings for deficit reduction; and
            (4) unobligated balances in dormant accounts should not be 
        used to finance increases in spending.

SEC. 619. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER 
              DOLLARS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The budget of the House is $188 million less than it 
        was when the Republicans last attained the majority in 2011.
            (2) The House has achieved significant savings by 
        consolidating operations and renegotiating contracts.
    (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.--It is 
the policy of this concurrent resolution that--
            (1) the House should be a model for the responsible 
        stewardship of taxpayer resources, and identify any savings 
        that can be achieved through greater productivity and 
        efficiency gains in the operation and maintenance of House 
        services and resources, including printing, conferences, 
        utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds maintenance, 
        postage, and rent;
            (2) the House should review policies and procedures for the 
        acquisition of goods and services to eliminate unnecessary 
        spending;
            (3) the Committee on House Administration should review the 
        policies pertaining to services provided to Members and 
        committees of the House, and identify ways to reduce any 
        subsidies paid for the operation of the House gym, barbershop, 
        salon, and the House dining room;
            (4) no taxpayer funds should be used to purchase first 
        class airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of 
        Congress; and
            (5) retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not 
        include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.

SEC. 620. POLICY STATEMENT ON EXPENDITURES FROM AGENCY FEES AND 
              SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A number of Federal agencies and organizations have 
        permanent authority to collect and spend fees and other 
        offsetting collections.
            (2) The Office of Management and Budget estimated the total 
        amount of offsetting fees and offsetting collections to be $525 
        billion in fiscal year 2016.
            (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not 
        fully transparent about the amount of program activity funded 
        through offsetting collections or fees. This lack of 
        transparency prevents effective and accountable Government.
    (b) Policy on Agency Fees and Spending.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that Congress should reassert its constitutional 
prerogative to control spending and conduct oversight. Congress should 
subject all agency fees received from the public to annual 
appropriations or authorization legislation, except for such fees that 
are for business-like activities or necessary to fund current 
operations.

SEC. 621. POLICY STATEMENT ON BORDER SECURITY.

    (a) Findings on Border Security.--The House finds the following:
            (1) In fiscal year 2015, the United States Customs and 
        Border Protection apprehended 337,117 persons crossing our 
        international borders illegally between the ports of entry. 
        There is no statistical information to determine the number of 
        persons who were not apprehended and entered the country 
        illegally.
            (2) The Government Accountability Office has reported that 
        while the number of apprehensions provides a proxy for the flow 
        of illegal migration, it is not a suitable measure of border 
        security effectiveness.
            (3) The Department of Homeland Security stopped reporting 
        miles of the border under operational control in 2011, but has 
        failed to replace that measure with an alternative, or other 
        reliable indicators that measure border security effectiveness.
    (b) Policy on Border Security.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution that Congress should pass legislation bolstering our border 
security by--
            (1) installing technology along the southern and northern 
        borders of the U.S., including tower-based surveillance, 
        subterranean detection, radar surveillance, unmanned aerial 
        vehicles, and other resources in order to gain a full 
        understanding of the threat and vulnerabilities along the 
        border;
            (2) constructing new fencing and replace ineffective 
        fencing and barriers, maintain or build vehicle access roads, 
        and establish forward operating bases along the southern 
        border; and
            (3) increasing the current levels of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection Officers and U.S. Border Patrol Agents.

SEC. 622. POLICY STATEMENT ON PREVENTING THE CLOSURE OF THE GUANTANAMO 
              BAY DETENTION FACILITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Guantanamo Bay detention facility is a critical 
        tool in America's continuing fight against terrorism.
            (2) Of the 653 Guantanamo Bay detainees that have left the 
        facility, 117 (17.9 percent) are ``confirmed'' and 79 (12.1 
        percent) are ``suspected of reengaging'' in ``terrorist or 
        insurgent activities'' according to the latest unclassified 
        report issued in September 2015 by the Office of the Director 
        of National Intelligence.
            (3) President Obama's support of closing the Guantanamo Bay 
        detention facility would significantly increase risk to our 
        national security.
    (b) Policy on Preventing the Closure of the Guantanamo Bay 
Detention Facility.--This concurrent resolution supports policies, 
consistent with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2016 (Public Law 114-92), that would prevent the--
            (1) closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility;
            (2) modifications of facilities in the United States to 
        house Guantanamo Bay detainees; and
            (3) transfer or release of detainees to certain countries.

SEC. 623. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFUGEES FROM CONFLICT ZONES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Since the Syrian civil war broke out in March 2011, an 
        estimated 4.6 million Syrians have fled the country, with 
        approximately 500,000 attempting to seek asylum in Europe or 
        elsewhere in the West, including the United States.
            (2) According to the House Committee on Homeland Security 
        report entitled Syrian Refugee Flows: Security Risks and 
        Counterterrorism Challenges, ``the administration proposal to 
        resettle Syrian refugees in the United States will have limited 
        impact on alleviating the refugee crisis; however, it could 
        have serious ramifications for U.S. homeland security.''.
            (3) In response to a letter from chair Michael McCaul of 
        the House Committee on Homeland Security, the National 
        Counterterrorism Center stated that, ``the refugee system, like 
        all immigration programs, is vulnerable to exploitation from 
        extremist groups seeking to send operatives to the West.''.
            (4) In 2011, the FBI arrested two Kentucky-based Iraqi 
        refugees attempting to send weapons and explosives from 
        Kentucky to Iraq and conspiring to commit terrorism while in 
        Iraq. It was later discovered that a flaw in background 
        screening of Iraqi refugees allowed these two Al Qaeda-linked 
        terrorists to settle in Kentucky.
            (5) On November 13, 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and 
        Syria (ISIS) launched a terrorist attack targeting civilians in 
        Paris, killing at least 129 people, including one American. At 
        least one of the attackers may have infiltrated France using 
        the cover of the unprecedented Syrian refugee flow into Europe.
    (b) Policy on Refugee Screening and Resettlement.--It is the policy 
of this concurrent resolution that the United States should suspend 
admission of refugees from such high-risk areas as Syria and Iraq until 
it can ensure that terrorists cannot exploit its refugee resettlement 
programs and vetting processes. While the United States should continue 
its proud tradition of refugee resettlement, it should make protecting 
Americans its highest priority before resettling additional refugees.

SEC. 624. POLICY STATEMENT ON MOVING THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
              ON BUDGET.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The President's Commission on Budget Concepts 
        recommends that the budget should ``as a general rule, be 
        comprehensive of the full range of Federal activity''.
            (2) The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-
        239) moved the United States Postal Service (USPS) off budget 
        and exempted it from sequestration.
            (3) The USPS has a direct effect on the fiscal posture of 
        the Government, through--
                    (A) the receipt of direct appropriations of $96 
                million in fiscal year 2016;
                    (B) congressional mandates such as requirements for 
                mail delivery service schedules;
                    (C) incurring $15 billion in debt from the 
                Treasury, the maximum permitted by law;
                    (D) continued operating deficits since 2007;
                    (E) defaulting on its statutory obligation to 
                prefund health care benefits for future retirees; and
                    (F) carrying $125 billion in total unfunded 
                liabilities with no foreseeable pathway of funding 
                these liabilities under current law.
    (b) Policy on Moving the USPS on Budget.--It is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that all receipts and disbursements of the USPS 
should be included in the congressional budget and the budget of the 
Government.

SEC. 625. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.

    It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House 
should--
            (1) adopt an annual budget resolution before spending and 
        tax legislation is considered in either House of Congress;
            (2) assess measures for timely compliance with budget rules 
        in the House;
            (3) pass legislation to strengthen enforcement of the 
        budget resolution;
            (4) comply with the discretionary spending limits set forth 
        in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
        1985;
            (5) prevent the use of accounting gimmicks to offset higher 
        spending;
            (6) modify scoring conventions to encourage the 
        commercialization of Government activities that can best be 
        provided by the private sector; and
            (7) discourage the use of savings identified in the budget 
        resolution as offsets for spending or tax legislation.

SEC. 626. POLICY STATEMENT ON UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative 
        power in the Congress.
            (2) Central to the legislative powers of Congress is the 
        authorization of appropriations necessary to execute the laws 
        that establish agencies and programs and impose obligations.
            (3) Clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives prohibits the consideration of appropriations 
        measures that provide appropriations for unauthorized programs.
            (4) More than $310 billion has been appropriated for 
        unauthorized programs in fiscal year 2016, spanning 256 
        separate laws.
            (5) Agencies such as the Department of State have not been 
        authorized for 14 years.
    (b) Policy on Unauthorized Appropriations.--In the House, it is the 
policy of this concurrent resolution that rules relating to 
unauthorized appropriations should be reviewed and reformed to ensure 
that unauthorized programs are either reauthorized, reformed, or 
terminated.
