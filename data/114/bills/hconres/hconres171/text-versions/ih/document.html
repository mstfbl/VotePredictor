                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the 
     lasting significance of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.

Whereas, on December 7, 1941, without warning and minutes before 8 a.m., 
        aircraft of the Imperial Japanese Navy and Air Force attacked United 
        States military installations at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere on the 
        Island of Oahu, Hawaii;
Whereas the bulk of the attack at Pearl Harbor lasted for approximately five 
        hours, during which 2,403 members of the United States Armed Forces were 
        killed or mortally wounded, 1,247 members of the Armed Forces were 
        wounded, and 57 civilians lost their lives;
Whereas Japanese aircraft mercilessly attacked American facilities, naval 
        vessels, and aircraft in two waves, destroying or severely damaging 
        numerous vessels of the United States Pacific fleet and 188 United 
        States aircraft, while Japanese submarines torpedoed several American 
        vessels between San Francisco and Honolulu;
Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the day of the attack on 
        Pearl Harbor ``a date which will live in infamy'', and Americans became 
        united in remembrance of their fallen countrymen and committed to 
        defending the United States against all aggressors;
Whereas the following day, on December 8, 1941, Congress declared war against 
        Japan, and three days later against Germany, thus beginning America's 
        involvement in a global conflict that would define a generation;
Whereas more than 320,000 American men sacrificed their lives to preserve the 
        sacred freedoms of the United States, to cease forever the spread of 
        Nazism through Europe and imperialism by Japan;
Whereas, after nearly four years of warfare, on September 2, 1945, after victory 
        on the European front, World War II ended with the Japanese surrendering 
        aboard the USS Missouri;
Whereas, in 1950, Admiral Arthur Radford ordered that a flagpole be erected over 
        the remains of the USS Arizona, one of the United States battleships 
        sunk at Pearl Harbor;
Whereas the USS Arizona serves as the final resting place for many of the 
        battleship's 1,177 crew members who lost their lives on December 7, 
        1941;
Whereas the USS Arizona also serves as an educational site for citizens and 
        international visitors alike, raising awareness about the attack on 
        Pearl Harbor and the perils of war;
Whereas the terms of Japanese surrender fostered significant democratic reform 
        in Japan, including ensuring the individual liberty and rights of the 
        people of Japan;
Whereas the United States has moved beyond the tragedy of Pearl Harbor and war 
        against Japan and, in the years since the conclusion of World War II, 
        has formed a strong and valuable alliance with Japan, including military 
        cooperation and bilateral trade;
Whereas, on March 14, 2016, Congressman K. Mark Takai introduced House 
        Concurrent Resolution 124 to commemorate this year's 75th anniversary of 
        the attack on Pearl Harbor; and
Whereas, on August 23, 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-308 (reenacted 
        later as section 129 of title 36, United States Code), which designated 
        December 7th of each year as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and 
        requests the President to issue each year a proclamation calling on the 
        people of the United States to observe National Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
        Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and all departments, 
        agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government, and 
        interested organizations, groups, and individuals, to fly the flag of 
        the United States at half-staff each December 7th in honor of the 
        individuals who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the December 
7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii--
            (1) pays tribute to the members of the United States Armed 
        Forces and civilians who died in the attack;
            (2) honors the thousands of men and women of the United 
        States Armed Forces who paid the ultimate sacrifice and gave 
        their lives in defense of freedom and liberty during World War 
        II;
            (3) acknowledges the continued peaceful and mutually 
        beneficial relationship between the United States and Japan;
            (4) appreciates the efforts of Japan as one of the most 
        reliable security partners of the United States; and
            (5) encourages Japan to continue to develop strategic and 
        economic policies, in partnership with the United States, that 
        promote stability throughout Asia and reduce barriers in trade 
        between the two nations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
