                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that an appropriate site in the 
Memorial Amphitheater in Arlington National Cemetery should be provided 
   for a memorial marker to honor the memory of those who have been 
 awarded or are eligible for the Korean Defense Service Medal who are 
      missing in action, are unaccounted for, or died in-theater.

Whereas the Korean War, which began in 1950 and ended when the Korean War 
        armistice was signed in 1953, is commonly known as the ``Forgotten 
        War'';
Whereas a later war in Korea, known only to some veterans and families of those 
        veterans as the ``DMZ War'' or the ``Forgotten War of the Forgotten 
        War'', occurred long after the signing of the Korean War armistice;
Whereas, according to military documents, the leadership of the Democratic 
        People's Republic of Korea issued a declaration of war against the 
        United States in a speech in 1966, which read, ``United States 
        imperialists should be dealt blows and their forces dispersed to the 
        maximum in Asia'';
Whereas the 124th special forces unit of the Democratic People's Republic of 
        Korea was trained to destroy the camps and civilians of the United 
        States, to disrupt travel and communication between the Armed Forces, 
        and to sabotage and assassinate the government officials of the Republic 
        of Korea and the United States;
Whereas the 124th special forces unit of Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
        repeatedly confronted the soldiers of the United States and the Republic 
        of Korea when crossing through the demilitarized zone;
Whereas since the armistice was signed, more than 40,000 armistice violations 
        have occurred, many of which affected members of the Armed Forces who 
        were stationed in and around Korea;
Whereas some of those violations, like the capture of the USS Pueblo, caught the 
        attention of the media, although most have not;
Whereas since the end of the Korean War, many members of the Armed Forces have 
        died or been wounded in Korea as a result of hostile fire;
Whereas, in 1994, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shot down a United 
        States Bell OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter and killed Chief Warrant 
        Officer David Hilemon and held Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall captive 
        for 13 days;
Whereas since the armistice agreement, more than 40,000 members of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States have served in the Republic of Korea or the 
        surrounding waters;
Whereas some veterans of the Armed Forces suffer from exposure to Agent Orange, 
        which was used during a period that began in 1968 and ended in 1971 in 
        and around the demilitarized zone;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces who served in the demilitarized zone were 
        exposed to Agent Orange long after the Armed Forces stopped using it;
Whereas members of the Armed Forces who served in the Korean War during the 
        period that began in 1966 and ended in 1974 received the Armed Forces 
        Expeditionary Medal;
Whereas few of the soldiers who fought and died in the Korean War have been 
        nominated for the Congressional Medal of Honor or awarded the Silver 
        Star or Bronze Star or the Combat Infantry Badge for valor in combat or 
        the Purple Heart for being wounded in combat; and
Whereas members of the Armed Forces who served or are serving in the Republic of 
        Korea since July 28, 1954, have received the Korean Defense Service 
        Medal: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that an appropriate site in the 
Memorial Amphitheater in Arlington National Cemetery should be provided 
for a memorial marker, to be paid for with private funds, to honor the 
memory of those who have been awarded or are eligible for the Korean 
Defense Service Medal who are missing in action, are unaccounted for, 
or died in-theater, if the Secretary of the Army has exclusive 
authority to approve the design and site of the memorial marker.
