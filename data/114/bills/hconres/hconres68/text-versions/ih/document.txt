Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the 225th anniversary of the 
                   establishment of the Coast Guard.

Whereas the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1790 under the 
        jurisdiction of the Treasury Department;
Whereas the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Life-Saving Service 
        were combined in 1915 to form the Coast Guard;
Whereas, in April 1967, the Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of 
        Transportation;
Whereas, in November 2002, the Coast Guard was transferred to the newly created 
        Department of Homeland Security, where it remains today;
Whereas the Coast Guard is comprised of nearly 36,000 active personnel and over 
        7,000 reserve personnel, and is supported by the approximately 29,000 
        volunteers of the Coast Guard Auxiliary;
Whereas the Coast Guard is at all times an armed force, a regulatory agency, a 
        humanitarian service, a Federal law enforcement agency, and a member of 
        the intelligence community and is responsible for the safety, security, 
        and stewardship of United States waters;
Whereas each year the Coast Guard conducts on average more than 17,500 search 
        and rescue missions, saving over 3,400 lives and $47,000,000 in 
        property;
Whereas each year the Coast Guard, through its drug interdiction efforts, keeps 
        more than $3,000,000,000 worth of illegal drugs out of the United 
        States;
Whereas the Coast Guard safeguards ocean resources from degradation by pollution 
        and overuse through marine environmental protection and fisheries 
        enforcement programs;
Whereas each year the Coast Guard responds to more than 8,900 pollution incident 
        reports, conducts over 43,700 recreational vessel boardings and 5,900 
        fisheries conservation boardings, and investigates over 5,800 commercial 
        vessel marine casualties;
Whereas the Coast Guard maintains the largest system of aids to navigation in 
        the world, with more than 42,000 buoys, fixed markers, and lighthouses;
Whereas the Coast Guard provides critical ice breaking services for the inland 
        waterways and shipping channels of the United States;
Whereas the Coast Guard plays a leading role in undocumented migrant 
        interdiction activities;
Whereas Coast Guard personnel have fought in every major military conflict since 
        the Coast Guard's inception in 1790;
Whereas the men and women serving in the Coast Guard embody a rich tradition of 
        honor, respect, and devotion to duty during times of peace and war; and
Whereas, for the past 225 years, the Coast Guard's central missions have been 
        maritime search and rescue and maritime law enforcement: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress, recognizing the historic significance of the 225th 
anniversary of the Coast Guard--
            (1) expresses the appreciation of the people of the United 
        States to the Coast Guard and the Coast Guardsmen who have 
        provided 225 years of dedicated service; and
            (2) commends--
                    (A) the Coast Guard's effectiveness in protecting 
                the public, the environment, and United States economic 
                and security interests in United States ports and 
                inland waterways, along United States coasts, on 
                international waters, and in any maritime region in 
                which United States interests may be at risk;
                    (B) the men and women serving in the Coast Guard 
                who risk their lives to save others in danger at sea, 
                enforce United States treaties and other laws, protect 
                the marine environment, ensure a safe and efficient 
                marine transportation system, and support diplomatic 
                and national defense interests of the United States 
                worldwide; and
                    (C) the Coast Guard in its efforts to remain 
                ``Semper Paratus'', Always Ready, as it moves forward 
                to meet the demands of the 21st century.
