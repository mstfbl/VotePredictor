                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 28, 2016

concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight 
                         and Government Reform

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of a ``National Purebred Dog 
                                 Day''.

Whereas there is currently no day set aside to celebrate and acknowledge the 
        contributions of the purebred dog, and we wish to designate a day to 
        expressly recognize those contributions;
Whereas purebred dogs are living legacies of the cultures that created them, and 
        historically these dogs worked alongside their people and provided them 
        companionship;
Whereas today, the service of these breeds continues as they work alongside 
        humans and provide inestimable companionship while serving as guide 
        dogs, service dogs, conservation dogs, livestock guardians, search and 
        rescue dogs, earth dogs, police dogs, canine soldiers serving by the 
        sides of our military men and women, and ultimately guardians of family, 
        home, and hearth;
Whereas purebred dogs have been of enormous help to medical science, serving as 
        models for many heritable human diseases, playing a role in humanity's 
        understanding of the human and canine genomes, and benefitting 
        pharmaceutical research and development;
Whereas purebred dogs are working dogs, serving as avalanche dogs, trackers and 
        trailers, herders, controllers of vermin, water rescuers, carting and 
        sled dogs, retrievers, protectors, hunters, and bird dogs, and always 
        they are the heartbeat of a companion near and dear to humans;
Whereas all dogs should be valued, whatever their ancestry, but the purpose-bred 
        dog and the predictability of its breed should be cherished and 
        preserved; and
Whereas each breed is indelibly etched in the history of the culture that 
        created it just as surely as that culture's music, art, and language: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress supports the designation of a ``National Purebred Dog 
Day''.
                                 <all>
