                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress that every effort should be made to 
  assist in the reconstruction and development of communities against 
  whom the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has committed acts of 
 genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity as determined by the 
                       United States Government.

Whereas Congress and the Secretary of State have recognized that the Islamic 
        State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has committed genocide, crimes 
        against humanity, and other crimes against Christians, Yazidis, and 
        other peoples;
Whereas the national security and values of the American people are advanced by 
        the survival and sustainment of the many ethnic and religious minorities 
        in the Middle East, particularly those with no history of hostility 
        toward American interests or its people;
Whereas ISIL has inspired, directed, and committed international and domestic 
        acts of terrorism against United States nationals, allies, and 
        interests;
Whereas the United States is committed to defeating ISIL and its affiliates and 
        has identified disrupting the finances of ISIL, to include the flow of 
        external donations as a key part of its strategy to defeat the 
        organization;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2253 
        to impose multilateral financial sanctions against ISIL;
Whereas the United States Government has imposed financial sanctions pursuant to 
        its authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
        U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) ``to deal with an unusual and extraordinary 
        threat'' posed by ISIL, its members, and affiliates;
Whereas the International Emergency Economic Powers Act provides the President 
        with the authority to block all property and interests in property of 
        persons or entities designated pursuant to Executive order that are 
        within the jurisdiction of the United States;
Whereas section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
        U.S.C. 1705) provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
        against any persons who ``violate, attempt to violate, conspire to 
        violate, or cause a violation of any license, order, regulation, or 
        prohibition'' issued pursuant to such Act; and
Whereas section 203(a)(1)(C) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
        (50 U.S.C. 1702(a)(1)(C)) allows the United States Government to 
        ``confiscate any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
        States, of any foreign person, foreign organization, or foreign country 
        that . . . has planned, authorized, aided, or engaged in such 
        hostilities or attacks against the United States; and all right, title, 
        and interest in any property so confiscated shall vest . . . in such 
        agency or person as the President may designate'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) any civil or criminal penalties levied on individuals 
        and entities due to violations of United States Government or 
        international sanctions on the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant (ISIL) and its affiliates, or funds seized or recovered 
        from ISIL and their affiliates, should be directed by the 
        United States Government and its global partners for the 
        reconstruction and development of communities against whom ISIL 
        has committed acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against 
        humanity as determined by the United States Government;
            (2) the United States Government should establish a fund, 
        consisting of any civil or criminal penalties levied on 
        individuals and entities due to violations of United States 
        Government or international sanctions on ISIL and its 
        affiliates, and funds seized or recovered from ISIL and their 
        affiliates;
            (3) the United States Government should use all available 
        legal authorities, including section 203(a)(1)(C) of the 
        International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
        1702(a)(1)(C)), to confiscate and vest all assets frozen 
        pursuant to United States economic sanctions against ISIL, its 
        members, and affiliates;
            (4) the United States Government should use such recovered 
        assets and any fines or penalties imposed against violators of 
        United States sanctions against ISIL, its members, and 
        affiliates for the reconstruction and development of 
        communities against whom ISIL has committed acts of genocide, 
        war crimes, or crimes against humanity as determined by the 
        United States Government; and
            (5) the United States Government should make every effort 
        to encourage its international partners to similarly vest 
        frozen assets of ISIL, its members, and affiliates for the 
        reconstruction and development of communities against whom ISIL 
        has committed acts of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against 
        humanity as determined by the United States Government.
