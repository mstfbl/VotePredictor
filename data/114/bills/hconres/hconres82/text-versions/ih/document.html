                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the White House Fellows Program.

Whereas in 1964, John W. Gardner presented the idea of selecting a group of 
        outstanding men and women to come to Washington and learn about the 
        workings of the Federal Government at the highest levels and to observe 
        the Nation's leaders in action and meet with these officials and other 
        leaders of society, thereby strengthening the Fellows' abilities and 
        desires to contribute to their communities, their professions and their 
        country;
Whereas President Lyndon B. Johnson established the President's Commission on 
        White House Fellowships, through Executive Order 11183 (as amended) to 
        create a program that would select between 11 and 19 outstanding young 
        Americans every year and bring them to Washington for a ``first hand, 
        high-level experience in the workings of the Federal Government, to 
        establish an era when the young men and women of America and their 
        government belonged to each other - belonged to each other in fact and 
        in spirit'';
Whereas the White House Fellows Program has steadfastly remained a nonpartisan 
        program that has served and been supported by nine Presidents;
Whereas the 738 White House Fellows, after serving their year in Washington, 
        have returned to their States and communities and became leaders in all 
        walks of life, including heads of the Nation's largest corporations and 
        law firms, university presidents and deans of distinguished graduate 
        schools, leaders of non-profit organizations, distinguished scholars and 
        journalists, high-level government officials, cabinet officers, 
        ambassadors, deputy and assistant secretaries, judges, distinguished 
        scholars and historians, leaders in national journalism and the working 
        press, Members of Congress, and senior leaders in all branches of United 
        States Armed Forces;
Whereas this legacy of leadership is a national resource that has served the 
        Nation in major challenges, including organizing resettlement operations 
        following the Vietnam War, assisting with the national response to 
        terrorist attacks, managing the aftermath of natural disasters such as 
        Hurricane Katrina and Rita, providing support to earthquake victims in 
        Haiti and Nepal, performing military service in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
        and reforming and innovating in national and international securities 
        and capital markets;
Whereas the 738 White House Fellows have characterized their post-Fellowship 
        years with a demonstrable lifetime commitment to public service through 
        continuing personal and professional renewal and association, creating a 
        White House Fellows Community of Mutual Support for leadership at every 
        level of government and in every element of our national life; and
Whereas September 1, 2015, marked the 50th anniversary of the first class of 
        White House Fellows to serve this Nation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of the White House 
        Fellows Program and commends the White House Fellows for their 
        continuing lifetime commitment to public service;
            (2) acknowledges the legacy of leadership provided by White 
        House Fellows over the years in their local communities, the 
        Nation, and the world; and
            (3) expresses appreciation and support for the continuing 
        leadership of White House Fellows in all aspects of our 
        national life in the years ahead.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
