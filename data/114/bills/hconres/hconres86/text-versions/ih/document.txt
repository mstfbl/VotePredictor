Whereas the people of Pakistan have consistently aspired to democracy and rule 
        of law;
Whereas Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is a democratically elected leader of 
        Pakistan and is a symbol of the first successful democratic transition 
        in Pakistani history;
Whereas Pakistanis have been victim of attacks by Al-Qaida and other terrorist 
        networks and more than 50,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives in these 
        attacks;
Whereas terrorists have also targeted schools, including the Army Public School, 
        where 140 school children were killed in a gruesome attack in December 
        2014;
Whereas Pakistan has undertaken successful military operations against militants 
        in the border areas at a huge material and human cost;
Whereas Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is leading implementation of a National 
        Action Plan to defeat terrorism so that all Pakistani communities, 
        including religious and ethnic minorities, can live safely;
Whereas there are tremendous opportunities to enhance people-to-people exchanges 
        between Pakistan and the United States through trade, education, and 
        development; and
Whereas over the past decade the United States has extended support and 
        assistance to Pakistan to meet its security and economic challenges: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
