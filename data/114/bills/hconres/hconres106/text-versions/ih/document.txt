                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the Islamic 
        State of Iraq and the Levant and its associated forces.

Whereas the terrorist organization referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and 
        the Levant and various other names (in this concurrent resolution 
        referred to as ``ISIL'') has been systematically targeting, kidnapping, 
        and killing innocent men, women, and children throughout Iraq and Syria, 
        continues to expand its terror influence, and is responsible for recent 
        attacks in Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, and France;
Whereas foreign fighters, undeterred by the more than 60 nation coalition 
        operating against ISIL, continue to join the ranks of ISIL with the goal 
        of establishing a caliphate;
Whereas, on June 19, 2014, President Barack Obama stated that ``ISIL poses a 
        threat to the Iraqi people, to the region and to U.S. interests'';
Whereas, on August 19, 2014, ISIL released a video of the beheading of an 
        American journalist, James Foley, and threatened to kill more Americans;
Whereas, on September 2, 2014, ISIL released a second video, of the beheading of 
        an Israeli-American journalist, Steven Sotloff, and again threatened to 
        kill more;
Whereas a Central Intelligence Agency assessment in September 2014 estimated 
        that ISIL can muster as many as 31,500 fighters in Syria and Iraq alone;
Whereas, on November 16, 2014, ISIL released yet another video of militant 
        ``Jihadi John'' standing over the severed head of former Army Ranger 
        Peter Kassig;
Whereas Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler, a member of a United States Special 
        Forces operations team, was killed during a daring raid on an ISIL 
        stronghold in Iraq to rescue 70 prisoners who were slated to be 
        executed;
Whereas American hostage Kayla Mueller, a 26-year-old female, was kidnapped and 
        repeatedly raped for almost 18 months by the leader of ISIL, Abu Bakr 
        al-Baghdadi;
Whereas, on November 13, 2015, ISIL carried out a coordinated attack on Paris, 
        France, killing more than 129 people from at least 14 different 
        countries, including American student Nohemi Gonzalez;
Whereas, on November 16, 2015, Central Intelligence Agency Director Brennan 
        warned, following ISIL's horrific terrorist in Paris, that the attack 
        was likely ``not the only operation that ISIL has in the pipeline'';
Whereas, on August 18, 2014, Pope Francis said that the international community 
        would be justified in stopping ISIL;
Whereas, on August 21, 2014, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
        General Dempsey stated that ISIL ``has an apocalyptic, end-of-days 
        strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated'';
Whereas, on September 16, 2014, former Secretary of Defense Hagel testified 
        before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``if left 
        unchecked, ISIL will directly threaten our homeland and our allies'';
Whereas, on September 17, 2014, during a hearing of the Committee on Foreign 
        Relations of the Senate, Secretary of State Kerry stated that ``ISIL 
        must be defeated. Period. End of story'';
Whereas, on March 13, 2015, Central Intelligence Agency Director Brennan stated 
        that ``ISIL is well-armed and well-financed. Its fighters are 
        disciplined, committed, and battle-hardened. Left unchecked, the group 
        would pose a serious danger not only to Syria and Iraq, but to the wider 
        region beyond, including the threat of attacks in the homelands of the 
        United States and our partners'';
Whereas, on July 23, 2015, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Comey stated 
        that ``[t]he threat that ISIL presents to the United States is very 
        different in kind, in type, in degree than al Qaeda. ISIL is not your 
        parent's al Qaeda, it's a very different model. And by virtue of that 
        model, it's currently the threat that we are worried about in the 
        homeland most of all'';
Whereas, on November 16, 2015, following the attacks on Paris, France, ISIL 
        released a video threatening to ``strike America at its center in 
        Washington'';
Whereas, on November 17, 2015, former Central Intelligence Agency Director 
        Panetta warned that countering the threat posed by ISIL ``isn't about 
        containment. It is about defeating ISIS. I think if there's anything we 
        ought to understand from these last events [in Paris], it's that we have 
        to go to war against this brutal enemy'';
Whereas after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress authorized 
        the use of military force against al Qaeda;
Whereas ISIL poses a direct threat to the United States homeland that is equal 
        to or greater than the threat posed by al Qaeda prior to the terrorist 
        attacks of September 11, 2001; and
Whereas, although nothing in this concurrent resolution limits the authorities 
        of the President under article 2 of the Constitution of the United 
        States, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. 
        v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) that ``[w]hen the President acts pursuant 
        to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at 
        its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus 
        all that Congress can delegate'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
