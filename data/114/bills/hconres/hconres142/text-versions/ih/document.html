                   Congress with respect to that bid.

Whereas the International Olympic Committee will meet on September 13, 2017, in 
        Lima, Peru, to consider a site for the Summer Olympic and Paralympic 
        Games (in this preamble referred to as the ``Games'') in 2024;
Whereas the United States Olympic Committee has selected Los Angeles, 
        California, as the candidate of the United States for the 2024 Games;
Whereas the Games further the cause of world peace and understanding;
Whereas the country that hosts the Games performs an act of international 
        goodwill;
Whereas the Games have not been held in the United States since 1996;
Whereas many of the world-class venues to be used in Los Angeles' 2024 plan for 
        the Games are already built or are planned as permanent facilities; and
Whereas Los Angeles is positioned to deliver an innovative, fiscally 
        responsible, and sustainable Games: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) advises the International Olympic Committee that the 
        United States would welcome the holding of the 2024 Summer 
        Olympic and Paralympic Games in Los Angeles, California, the 
        site designated by the United States Olympic Committee;
            (2) expresses the sincere hope that the United States will 
        be selected as the site for the 2024 Summer Olympic and 
        Paralympic Games and pledges cooperation and support toward the 
        successful fulfillment of those Games in the highest sense of 
        the Olympic tradition; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the United 
        States Olympic Committee and to the International Olympic 
        Committee.
