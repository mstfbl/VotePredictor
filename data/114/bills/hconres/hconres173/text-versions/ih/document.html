                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress regarding reconsideration of the 
merits of awarding the Medal of Honor posthumously to Doris Miller for 
 acts of valor during World War II for which he was originally awarded 
                            the Navy Cross.

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Navy should 
reconsider, pursuant to the process authorized by section 1130 of title 
10, United States Code, whether the award of the Navy Cross to Doris 
Miller (service number 356-12-35) for acts of valor during the attack 
on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while a member of the United 
States Navy should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor on account of 
possible racial bias in the original decision to award the Navy Cross.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
