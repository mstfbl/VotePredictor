                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Commemorating the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 
 December 7, 1941, and the sinking of the U.S.S. West Virginia during 
                              that attack.

Whereas the U.S.S. West Virginia, nicknamed the ``Wee Vee'' was a Colorado-class 
        battleship commissioned in 1923, and was the last battleship the Navy 
        would build for the next two decades;
Whereas the Navy stationed the U.S.S. West Virginia in Pearl Harbor to help 
        defend against potential enemy attacks in the Pacific;
Whereas the U.S.S. West Virginia was the second battleship docked at Pearl 
        Harbor to be struck by torpedoes during the attack on December 7, 1941;
Whereas the attack on the U.S.S. West Virginia included at least seven torpedoes 
        and two bombs;
Whereas, when the gravest moments of the attack occurred, the crew of the U.S.S. 
        West Virginia bravely fought back to defend the ship;
Whereas the valor of and skill of the crew of the U.S.S. West Virginia helped to 
        prevent the ship from immediately capsizing after the torpedoing;
Whereas 106 Navy sailors were killed while trying to heroically defend the 
        U.S.S. West Virginia during the attack, even as it suffered extensive 
        damage and eventually flooded and sank;
Whereas in early 1942, the U.S.S. West Virginia was salvaged from the harbor 
        seabed and returned to the mainland for repairs;
Whereas the U.S.S. West Virginia re-entered service in June 1944, supporting the 
        Allied war efforts in the Pacific, including in the battles of Iwo Jima 
        and Okinawa; and
Whereas at the end of the war, the U.S.S. West Virginia was the only ship 
        present for Japan's surrender in Tokyo Bay that had been present and 
        attacked at Pearl Harbor: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) remembers the members of the Armed Forces who were 
        killed or wounded during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 
        7, 1941;
            (2) honors the service and courage of the members of the 
        Armed Forces who were stationed at Pearl Harbor at the time of 
        the attack;
            (3) commemorates the service of the crew of the U.S.S. West 
        Virginia and the crews of other Navy ships at Pearl Harbor, who 
        fought valiantly during the attack to prevent further damage 
        and destruction;
            (4) recognizes the resolve of the Navy in salvaging and 
        repairing the U.S.S. West Virginia and returning it to service 
        during World War II;
            (5) commends the brave members of the Armed Forces who 
        fought in World War II; and
            (6) reaffirms its commitment to continue to honor the 
        memory of all members of the Armed Forces who lost their lives 
        during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
