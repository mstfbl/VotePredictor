Supporting the goals and ideals of the International Decade for People 
                          of African Descent.

Whereas, in recognition of the African Diaspora, on December 23, 2013, the 
        United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/237, designating 
        the decade commencing on January 1, 2015, and ending on December 31, 
        2024, as the ``International Decade for People of African Descent'', 
        with the theme ``People of African descent: recognition, justice and 
        development'';
Whereas the African Diaspora is expansive, spanning across the globe from the 
        Americas and the Caribbean to Asia and Europe, with persons of African 
        descent having had a historical presence and currently residing on every 
        continent;
Whereas the historical bonds and shared experiences that tie the African 
        continent with the world must be recalled;
Whereas the global contributions of people of African descent must be recognized 
        as a means of preserving that heritage;
Whereas the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
        done at Helsinki August 1, 1975, states that ``participating States will 
        respect human rights and fundamental freedoms . . . for all without 
        distinction as to race, sex, language or religion'';
Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Organization of 
        American States, and other international organizations have undertaken 
        efforts to address the human rights situation of people of African 
        descent;
Whereas, on December 10, 2014, United States Permanent Representative to the 
        United Nations Samantha Power stated, ``The United States comes to the 
        International Decade for People of African Descent with a full and 
        robust commitment to ensuring the rights of persons of African descent, 
        and to combating racism and discrimination against them.''; and
Whereas a central goal of the International Decade for People of African Descent 
        is to strengthen national actions and regional and international 
        cooperation for the benefit of people of African descent in relation to 
        the full enjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil, and political 
        rights for people of African descent; the participation and integration 
        of people of African descent in all political, economic, social, and 
        cultural aspects of society; and the promotion of greater knowledge of, 
        and respect for, the diverse heritage and culture of people of African 
        descent: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the ``International 
        Decade for People of African Descent'';
            (2) encourages the recognition and celebration of the 
        collective history and achievements made by people of African 
        descent;
            (3) reaffirms the importance of inclusion and the full and 
        equal participation of people of African descent around the 
        world in all aspects of political, economic, social, and 
        cultural life;
            (4) recognizes bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
        promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, including 
        those efforts that target the eradication of poverty, hunger, 
        and inequality; and
            (5) reaffirms the commitment of Congress to address racism, 
        discrimination, and intolerance in the United States and around 
        the globe.
                                 <all>
