  To express the sense of Congress regarding the safe and expeditious 
       resettlement to Albania of all residents of Camp Liberty.

    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SAFE RESETTLEMENT OF CAMP LIBERTY 
              RESIDENTS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--
            (1) work with the Government of Iraq and the United Nations 
        High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure that all 
        residents of Camp Liberty are safely and expeditiously 
        resettled in Albania;
            (2) work with the Government of Iraq, the Government of 
        Albania, and the UNHCR to prevent the Government of Iran from 
        intervening in the resettlement process by abusing 
        international organizations, including Interpol and other 
        organizations of which the United States is a member;
            (3) urge the Government of Iraq to take prompt and 
        appropriate steps in accordance with international agreements 
        to promote the physical security and protection of residents of 
        Camp Liberty during the resettlement process, including steps 
        to ensure that the personnel responsible for providing security 
        at Camp Liberty are adequately vetted to determine that they 
        are not affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' 
        Qods Force;
            (4) urge the Government of Iraq to ensure continued and 
        reliable access to food, clean water, medical assistance, 
        electricity and other energy needs, and any other equipment and 
        supplies necessary to sustain the residents during the 
        resettlement process;
            (5) work with the Government of Iraq to make all reasonable 
        efforts to facilitate the sale of residents' property and 
        assets remaining at Camp Ashraf and Camp Liberty for the 
        purpose of funding their cost of living and resettlement out of 
        Iraq;
            (6) work with the Government of Iraq and the United Nations 
        High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure that Camp 
        Liberty residents may exercise full control of all personal 
        assets in Camp Liberty and the former Camp Ashraf as the 
        residents deem necessary;
            (7) assist, and maintain close and regular communication 
        with the UNHCR for the purpose of expediting the ongoing 
        resettlement of all residents of Camp Liberty, without 
        exception, to Albania;
            (8) urge the Government of Albania, and the UNHCR to ensure 
        the continued recognition of the resettled residents as 
        ``persons of concern'' entitled to international protections 
        according to principles and standards in the Convention 
        Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, 
        1951, and the International Bill of Human Rights; and
            (9) work with the Government of Albania and the UNHCR to 
        facilitate and provide suitable locations for housing of the 
        remaining Camp Liberty residents in Albania until such time 
        when the residents become self-sufficient in meeting their 
        residential needs in Albania.
