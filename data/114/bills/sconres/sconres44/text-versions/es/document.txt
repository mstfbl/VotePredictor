                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas military caregivers are nameless, courageous, giving individuals whose 
        determination and sacrifices are rarely acknowledged and little-known 
        outside of the military community;
Whereas a military caregiver provides support and medical care to a member of 
        the uniformed services or veteran who suffers from a physical, mental, 
        or emotional wound or injury;
Whereas military caregivers can include a father, mother, spouse, sibling, 
        family member, loved one, or close friend of an injured member of the 
        uniformed services or veteran;
Whereas since the first armed conflict of the United States, injured veterans 
        have been cared for by family members and loved ones after returning 
        home from combat;
Whereas since the Revolutionary War, military caregivers in the United States 
        have tended to injured veterans as the veterans have recovered from seen 
        and unseen wounds from combat operations;
Whereas military caregivers have shown time and time again, regardless of the 
        conflict, that caring for those who return home is a part of the 
        character of the United States;
Whereas many of the members of the uniformed services and veterans who served in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom--

    (1) suffered wounds or injuries; and

    (2) require assistance from a caregiver to complete either activities 
of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and feeding, or instrumental 
activities such as transportation, meal preparation, and health management;

Whereas according to a study of military caregivers conducted by the RAND 
        Corporation, more than 1,000,000 individuals serve as caregivers to 
        veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom;
Whereas the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (Public 
        Law 111-163; 124 Stat. 1130) facilitated a new program for access to 
        health insurance, mental health services, caregiver training, and 
        respite care by family caregivers of veterans who served in Operation 
        Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom;
Whereas the adoration, loyalty, and longevity of military caregivers--

    (1) endures through the hardships of extended hospital stays, multiple 
surgeries, and lifetimes of care; and

    (2) helps create a fresh start that is hopeful even during difficult 
times;

Whereas the sunflower is a flower that symbolizes adoration, loyalty, and 
        longevity; and
Whereas there is no more appropriate representation of the devotion and 
        determination to overcome obstacles shown every day by military 
        caregivers than the sunflower: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors military caregivers for service and sacrifice to 
        the United States;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States--
                    (A) to show support to military families; and
                    (B) to recognize the sacrifices endured by those 
                families in service to the United States; and
            (3) recognizes the sunflower as the flower for military 
        caregivers.

            Passed the Senate July 11, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
