                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 20, 2015

   Mr. Rounds (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Thune, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. 
Capito, Mr. Risch, Mr. Hoeven, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and 
                             Administration

_______________________________________________________________________

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Establishing a joint select committee to address regulatory reform.

Whereas there are more than 3,500 rules issued every year by more than 50 
        Federal agencies;
Whereas a rule is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code, as 
        ``the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular 
        applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or 
        prescribe law or policy'';
Whereas subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, United States 
        Code (commonly known as the ``Administrative Procedure Act'') 
        established standards for the issuance of rules using formal rulemaking 
        and informal rulemaking procedures;
Whereas informal rulemaking, also known as ``notice and comment'' rulemaking or 
        ``section 553'' rulemaking, is the most common type of rulemaking;
Whereas in rulemaking proceedings, formal hearings must be held and interested 
        parties must be given the chance to comment on the proposed rule or 
        regulation, and once adopted, the rule or regulation is required to be 
        published in the Federal Register;
Whereas, according to a 2005 study commissioned by the Small Business 
        Administration, the cost of all rules in effect was approximately 
        $1,100,000,000,000 per year, more than the people of the United States 
        paid in Federal income taxes in 2009;
Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the 
        Competitive Enterprise Institute, the top 6 Federal rulemaking agencies 
        (which, in 2013, were the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, 
        Interior, Health and Human Services, and Transportation and the 
        Environmental Protection Agency) account for 49.3 percent of all Federal 
        rules;
Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the 
        Competitive Enterprise Institute, small businesses pay more in per-
        employee regulatory costs, and firms with fewer than 20 employees pay an 
        average of $10,585 per employee, compared to $7,755 for those with 500 
        or more employees;
Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the 
        Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory costs amount to an average 
        of $14,974 per household, which is 23 percent of the average household 
        income of $65,596 and 29 percent of the expenditure budget of $51,442;
Whereas, according to a 2011 study by the Weidenbaum Center at Washington 
        University, it is estimated that the budgetary cost of administering and 
        enforcing Federal regulations by Federal agencies for fiscal year 2012 
        amounted to more than $57 billion (in 2005 dollars), which represents a 
        10.5-percent increase in 2 years;
Whereas chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the 
        ``Congressional Review Act'') established a mechanism through which 
        Congress could overturn Federal regulations by enacting a joint 
        resolution of disapproval;
Whereas the Congressional Review Act requires that rules that have a 
        $100,000,000 effect or more on the economy are submitted by agencies to 
        both Houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office and 
        have a delayed effective date of not less than 60 days to pass a 
        resolution of disapproval rejecting the rule, which must be approved by 
        the President; and
Whereas, since the enactment of the Congressional Review Act in 1996, the 
        procedures under the Act have been used 1 time to overturn a rule: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This resolution may be cited as the ``Regulation Sensibility 
Through Oversight Restoration Resolution of 2015'' or the ``RESTORE 
Resolution of 2015''.

SEC. 2. JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE ON REGULATORY REFORM.

    There is established a joint select committee to be known as the 
Joint Select Committee on Regulatory Reform (hereinafter in this 
concurrent resolution referred to as the ``Joint Select Committee'').

SEC. 3. DUTIES OF JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE.

                            (i) to create a process under which an 
                        agency, before promulgating a rule, shall--
                                    (I) seek advice from Congress;
                                    (II) publish the proposed rule;
                                    (III) hold a public comment period 
                                on the proposed rule;
                                    (IV) seek advice from Congress 
                                based on the public comments; and
                                    (V) hold issuance of the rule until 
                                Congress can review the rule for a 
                                period of not more than 1 year; and
                            (ii) to create a process to appropriately 
                        sunset as many rules as possible;
                    (B) recommendations for ways to reduce the 
                financial burden placed on the various sectors of the 
                economy in order to comply with rules;
                    (C) an analysis of the feasibility of the creation 
                of a permanent Joint Committee on Rules Review in 
                accordance with subsection (c);
                    (D) an analysis of the feasibility of requiring 
                each agency to submit each proposed rule of the agency 
                to the appropriate committees of Congress for review in 
                a similar manner as set forth for a permanent Joint 
                Committee on Rules Review under subsection (c); and
                    (E) a list of rules and sets of rules that the 
                Joint Select Committee recommends should be repealed.
    (c) Analysis of Permanent Joint Committee on Rules Review.--The 
Joint Select Committee shall analyze the feasibility of the creation of 
a permanent Joint Committee on Rules Review. The Joint Committee on 
Rules Review would--
            (1) review each proposed rule that an agency determines is 
        likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $50,000,000 
        or more before the agency promulgates the final rule;
            (2) require each agency to submit to the Committee--
                    (A) the text of each proposed rule of the agency 
                described in paragraph (1); and
                    (B) an analysis of the economic impact of the rule 
                on the economy;
            (3) require each agency to revise a proposed rule submitted 
        under paragraph (2) if the Committee determines that the 
        proposed rule--
                    (A) needs to be significantly rewritten to 
                accomplish the intent of the agency or address the 
                recommendations or objections of the Committee;
                    (B) is not a valid exercise of delegated authority 
                from Congress;
                    (C) is not in proper form;
                    (D) is inconsistent with the intent of Congress 
                with respect to the provision of law that the proposed 
                rule implements; or
                    (E) is not a reasonable implementation of the law;
            (4) delay the effective date of a proposed rule for a 
        period of not more than 1 year beginning on the date on which 
        the agency submits the proposed rule under paragraph (2);
            (5) allow an agency to promulgate a final rule without any 
        delay in the effective date of the rule if the agency 
        designates the rule as an emergency rule, unless the Committee 
        by majority vote determines that the rule is not an emergency 
        rule; and
            (6) if applicable, recommend that Congress should overturn 
        a final rule promulgated by an agency by enacting a joint 
        resolution of disapproval.
