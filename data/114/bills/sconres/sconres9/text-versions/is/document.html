Honoring the life and memory of Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., 
          president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame.

Whereas Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., was born on May 25, 1917, in 
        Syracuse, New York, ordained a priest of the Congregation of Holy Cross 
        on June 24, 1943, in South Bend, Indiana, and served as president of the 
        University of Notre Dame from 1952 to 1987;
Whereas during his tenure, the University of Notre Dame welcomed female students 
        for the first time and embraced the spirit of open intellectual inquiry 
        and moral engagement that defines the University today;
Whereas Father Hesburgh held a variety of appointed positions under 4 popes and 
        9 Presidential administrations;
Whereas throughout decades of public service, Father Hesburgh proudly championed 
        the civil rights of African-Americans, the duty of society to the poor, 
        and the fundamental human dignity of all persons;
Whereas in pursuit of those ideals, Father Hesburgh held a variety of 
        influential public roles, including terms as a founding member and 
        chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, chair of the 
        Overseas Development Council, chair of the Select Commission on 
        Immigration and Refugee Policy, and permanent representative of the Holy 
        See to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna from 1956 to 
        1970;
Whereas in pursuit of global social justice, Father Hesburgh reaffirmed the 
        commitment of the University of Notre Dame to human rights by helping to 
        found the Kellogg Institute for International Studies and the Kroc 
        Institute for International Peace Studies at the University as well as 
        the Center for Civil and Human Rights at the University of Notre Dame 
        Law School;
Whereas Father Hesburgh was a longtime advocate for the responsible stewardship 
        of atomic energy and gracefully brought together scientists, scholars, 
        and spiritual leaders to work toward an end to nuclear conflict;
Whereas Father Hesburgh served as ambassador to the 1979 United Nations 
        Conference on Science and Technology for Development, the first Catholic 
        priest to formally hold a diplomatic position for the United States 
        Government;
Whereas Father Hesburgh received both the Congressional Gold Medal and the 
        Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian awards of the United 
        States, as well as more than 150 honorary degrees, the most ever awarded 
        to a single individual; and
Whereas Father Hesburgh passed away on Thursday, February 26, 2015, but remains 
        very much alive in the hearts of all who knew him and in the University 
        that he loved: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That the Congress--
            (1) commemorates the life and achievements of Reverend 
        Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., who throughout his life displayed 
        extraordinary commitment to social justice and the improvement 
        of higher education; and
            (2) honors Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., for a 
        lifetime of selfless dedication to God, Country, and Notre 
        Dame.
