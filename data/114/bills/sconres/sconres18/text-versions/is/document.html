                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
      Recognizing the daisy as the flower for military caregivers.

Whereas military caregivers are nameless, courageous, giving individuals whose 
        determination and sacrifices are rarely acknowledged and little-known 
        outside of the military community;
Whereas a military caregiver provides medical care to a member of the uniformed 
        services or veteran who suffers from a physical, mental, or emotional 
        wound or injury;
Whereas a military caregiver is a father, mother, spouse, sibling, family 
        member, or loved one of an injured member of the uniformed services or 
        veteran;
Whereas since the first armed conflict of the United States, injured veterans 
        have been cared for by family members and loved ones after returning 
        home from combat;
Whereas since the Revolutionary War, military caregivers in the United States 
        have tended to injured veterans as the veterans have recovered from seen 
        and unseen wounds from combat operations;
Whereas military caregivers have shown time and time again, regardless of the 
        conflict, that caring for those who return home is a part of the 
        character of the United States;
Whereas many of the members of the uniformed services and veterans who served in 
        Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom--

    (1) suffered wounds or injuries; and

    (2) require assistance from a caregiver to complete either activities 
of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and feeding, or instrumental 
activities such as transportation, meal preparation, and health management;

Whereas, according to a study of military caregivers conducted by the RAND 
        Corporation, as many as 1,000,000 spouses, parents, and children of 
        veterans have served or are currently serving as caregivers to veterans 
        who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom;
Whereas section 1672 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2008 (10 U.S.C. 1071 note; 122 Stat. 481) introduced an expansion of 
        medical care available to family caregivers;
Whereas the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (Public 
        Law 111-163; 124 Stat. 1130) facilitated a new program for access to 
        health insurance, mental health services, caregiver training, and 
        respite care by family caregivers of veterans who served in Operation 
        Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom;
Whereas the love and loyalty of military caregivers--

    (1) endures through the hardships of extended hospital stays, multiple 
surgeries, and lifetimes of care; and

    (2) helps create a fresh start that is hopeful even during difficult 
times;

Whereas the daisy is a flower that symbolizes both--

    (1) loyalty to love; and

    (2) new beginnings; and

Whereas there is no more appropriate representation of the devotion and 
        determination to overcome obstacles shown every day by military 
        caregivers than the daisy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors military caregivers for service and sacrifice to 
        the United States;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States--
                    (A) to show support to military families; and
                    (B) to recognize the sacrifices endured by those 
                families in service to the United States; and
            (3) recognizes the daisy as the flower for military 
        caregivers.
