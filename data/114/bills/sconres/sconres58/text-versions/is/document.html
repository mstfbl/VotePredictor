                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that rates for inmate calling service 
  should not exceed the affordable modified rate caps adopted by the 
                   Federal Communications Commission.

Whereas an estimated 5,000,000 United States children have, or have had, a 
        parent in prison or jail;
Whereas phone calls make it easier for families of incarcerated individuals to 
        maintain positive relationships with their loved ones who are 
        incarcerated;
Whereas phone calls help to reduce recidivism and promote the well-being of 
        children;
Whereas a reduction in recidivism rates by just 1 percent would save United 
        States taxpayers $250,000,000 per year in correctional costs;
Whereas families of incarcerated individuals frequently experience financial 
        hardship because of the loss of a key wage earner;
Whereas the cost of maintaining contact with incarcerated loved ones through in-
        person visits can be prohibitive;
Whereas written correspondence, especially with small children and disabled 
        individuals, can be an inadequate way of maintaining communication; and
Whereas the Federal Communications Commission has been steadfast in its efforts, 
        in accordance with its authority under the Communications Act of 1934 
        (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.)--

    (1) to bring about a compromise on inmate calling service rate caps; 
and

    (2) to ensure that those rates are just and reasonable: Now, therefore, 
be it

    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) rates for inmate calling service should not exceed the 
        affordable modified rate caps adopted by the Federal 
        Communications Commission as of the date of the adoption of 
        this resolution; and
            (2) reduced inmate calling service rates should be 
        implemented swiftly because of the importance of inmate calling 
        service as a rehabilitative means of communication.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
