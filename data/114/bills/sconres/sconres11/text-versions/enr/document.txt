        purposes of titles III and IV of the Congressional Budget Act 
        of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 631 et seq. and 651 et seq.), the Chairman of 
        the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives 
        shall use the baseline underlying the Congressional Budget 
        Office's March 2015 update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 
        2015 to 2025 (January 2015) when making estimates of any bill 
        or joint resolution, or any amendment thereto, amendment 
        between the Houses in relation thereto, or conference report 
        thereon. If adjustments to the baseline are made subsequent to 
        the adoption of this concurrent resolution, then such Chairman

        making such estimates.
            (B) Intent.--The authority set forth in subparagraph (A) 
        should only be exercised if the estimates used to determine the 
        compliance of such measures with the budgetary requirements 
        included in this concurrent resolution are inaccurate because 
        adjustments made to the baseline are inconsistent with the 
        assumptions underlying the budgetary levels set forth in this 
        concurrent resolution. Such inaccurate adjustments made after 
        the adoption of this concurrent resolution may include selected 
        adjustments for rulemaking, judicial actions, adjudication, and 
        interpretative rules that have major budgetary effects and are 
        inconsistent with the assumptions underlying the budgetary 
        levels set forth in this concurrent resolution.
            (C) Congressional budget office estimates.--Upon the 
        request of the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the 
        House of Representatives, the Congressional Budget Office shall 
        prepare for any measure an estimate based on the baseline 
        determination made by such Chairman pursuant to subparagraph 
        (A).
        (2) Repeal of the president's health care law through 
    reconciliation.--In the House of Representatives, in preparing 
    their submissions under subsection (a) to the Committee on the 
    Budget of the House of Representatives, the committees named in 
    subsection (a) shall--
            (A) note the policies discussed in title VI that repeal the 
        Affordable Care Act and the health care related provisions of 
        the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; and
            (B) determine the most effective methods by which the 
        health care laws referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be 
        repealed in their entirety.
        (3) Revision of budgetary levels.--
            (A) In general.--Upon the submission of a reconciliation 
        recommendation to the House of Representatives or the Committee 
        on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the submission 
        of a conference report to the House of Representatives pursuant 
        to this section, in which a committee is deemed to have 
        complied with its directive by virtue of section 310(c) of the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 641(c)), the 
        Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives may file with the House of Representatives 
        appropriately revised allocations, aggregates, and functional 
        levels.
            (B) Revision.--Allocations and aggregates revised pursuant 
        to this paragraph shall be considered to be allocations and 
        aggregates established by this concurrent resolution on the 
        budget pursuant to section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act 
        of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 632).

 TITLE V--ESTIMATES OF DIRECT SPENDING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

SEC. 5001. DIRECT SPENDING.

    (a) Means-Tested Direct Spending.--
        (1) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the 
    following:
            (A) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of 
        growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period 
        preceding fiscal year 2016 is 6.8 percent.
            (B) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average 
        rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period beginning with fiscal year 2016 is 4.6 percent under 
        current law.
        (2) Proposed reforms.--The following reforms are proposed under 
    this concurrent resolution by the House of Representatives for 
    means-tested direct spending:
            (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic 
        President reformed welfare by limiting the duration of 
        benefits, giving States more control over the program, and 
        helping recipients find work. In the 5 years following passage, 
        child-poverty rates fell, welfare caseloads fell, and workers' 
        wages increased. This budget assumes the enactment of proposals 
        to reduce poverty and increase opportunity and upward mobility 
        for struggling Americans on the road to personal and financial 
        independence. Based on the successful welfare reforms of the 
        1990s, these proposals would improve work requirements and 
        provide flexible funding for States to help those most in need 
        find gainful employment, escape poverty, and move up the 
        economic ladder.
            (B) For Medicaid, this budget is predicated on a framework 
        proposed by the chairmen of the committees of jurisdiction of 
        the House of Representatives and the Senate, to modernize and 
        improve the program while increasing State flexibility and 
        protecting the most vulnerable populations. This budget also 
        assumes the repeal of the Medicaid expansions in the 
        President's health care law.
    (b) Nonmeans-Tested Direct Spending.--
        (1) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the 
    following:
            (A) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate 
        of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period preceding fiscal year 2016 is 5.4 percent.
            (B) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated 
        average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 
        10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2016 is 5.5 percent 
        under current law.
        (2) Medicare reforms.--For Medicare, this budget advances 
    policies to put seniors, not the Federal Government, in control of 
    their health care decisions. Putting seniors in charge of how their 
    health care dollars are spent will encourage providers to compete 
    against each other on price and quality. Improvements to Medicare 
    are necessary to extend the life of the Federal Hospital Insurance 
    Trust Fund and protect the program for future generations.

                      TITLE VI--POLICY STATEMENTS
              Subtitle A--Policy Statements in Both Houses

SEC. 6101. POLICY STATEMENT ON BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.

    It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should 
pass, and send to the States for their approval, a joint resolution 
amending the Constitution of the United States to require an annual 
balanced Federal budget.

SEC. 6102. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the President 
and Congress should work together on a bipartisan basis to preserve 
Social Security for current and future generations. To achieve that 
goal--
        (1) Congress should enact legislation to prevent the near-term 
    insolvency of the Disability Insurance program, improve the 
    administration and coordination of benefits, and increase 
    employment opportunities for disabled workers; and
        (2) the President should submit legislation to Congress 
    addressing the long-term insolvency of both the Old-Age and 
    Survivors Insurance program and the Disability Insurance program, 
    and such legislation should achieve a sustainable annual cash-flow 
    balance between taxes and benefits over the foreseeable future, 
    rather than temporarily increasing and then depleting the balance 
    of Government securities held by each program's trust fund.

      Subtitle B--Policy Statement in the House of Representatives

SEC. 6201. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET PROCESS AND BASELINE REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--
        (1) In 1974, after more than 50 years of executive dominance 
    over fiscal policy, Congress acted to reassert its ``power of the 
    purse'', and passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
    Control Act.
        (2) The measure explicitly sought to establish congressional 
    control over the budget process, to provide for annual 
    congressional determination of the appropriate level of taxes and 
    spending, to set important national budget priorities, and to find 
    ways in which Members of Congress could have access to the most 
    accurate, objective, and highest quality information to assist them 
    in discharging their duties.
        (3) Far from achieving its intended purpose, however, the 
    process has instituted a bias toward higher spending and larger 
    government. The behemoth of the Federal Government has largely been 
    financed through either borrowing or taking ever greater amounts of 
    the national income through high taxation.
        (4) The process does not treat programs and policies 
    consistently and shows a bias toward higher spending and higher 
    taxes.
        (5) It assumes extension of spending programs (of more than $50 
    million per year) scheduled to expire.
        (6) Yet it does not assume the extension of tax policies in the 
    same way. consequently, extending existing tax policies that may be 
    scheduled to expire is characterized as a new tax reduction, 
    requiring offsets to ``pay for'' merely keeping tax policy the same 
    even though estimating conventions would not require similar 
    treatment of spending programs.
        (7) The original goals set for the congressional process are 
    admirable in their intent, but because the essential mechanisms of 
    the process have remained the same, and ``reforms'' enacted over 
    the past 40 years have largely taken the form of layering greater 
    levels of legal complexity without reforming or reassessing the 
    very fundamental nature of the process.
    (b) Policy Statement.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution on the budget that as the primary branch of Government, 
Congress must:
        (1) Restructure the fundamental procedures of budget decision 
    making.
        (2) Reassert Congress's ``power of the purse'', and reinforce 
    the balance of powers between Congress and the President, as the 
    1974 Act intended.
        (3) Create greater incentives for lawmakers to do budgeting as 
    intended by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, especially 
    adopting a budget resolution every year.
        (4) Encourage more effective control over spending, especially 
    currently uncontrolled direct spending.
        (5) Consider innovative fiscal tools such as: zero based 
    budgeting, which would require a department or agency to justify 
    its budget as if it were a new expenditure; and direct spending 
    caps to enhance oversight of automatic pilot spending that 
    increases each year without congressional approval.
        (6) Promote efficient and timely budget actions, so that 
    lawmakers complete their budget actions by the time the new fiscal 
    year begins.
        (7) Provide access to the best analysis of economic conditions 
    available and increase awareness of how fiscal policy directly 
    impacts overall economic growth and job creation.
        (8) Remove layers of complexity that have complicated the 
    procedures designed in 1974, and made budgeting more arcane and 
    opaque.
        (9) Remove existing biases that favor higher spending.
        (10) Include procedures by which current tax laws may be 
    extended and treated on a basis that is not different from the 
    extension of entitlement programs.
    (c) Budget Process Reform.--Comprehensive budget process reform 
should also remove the bias in the baseline against the extension of 
current tax laws in the following ways:
        (1) Permanent extension of tax laws should not be used as a 
    means to increase taxes on other taxpayers.
        (2) For those expiring tax provisions that are proposed to be 
    permanently extended, Congress should use a more realistic baseline 
    that does not require them to be offset.
        (3) Tax-reform legislation should not include tax increases 
    just to offset the extension of current tax laws.
    (d) Legislation.--The Committee on the Budget of the House of 
Representatives intends to draft legislation during the 114th Congress 
that will rewrite the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 
of 1974 to fulfill the goals of making the congressional budget process 
more effective in ensuring taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely and 
efficiently.

SEC. 6202. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) Although the United States economy technically emerged from 
    recession more than 5 years ago, the subsequent recovery has felt 
    more like a malaise than a rebound. Real gross domestic product GDP 
    growth over the past 5 years has averaged slightly more than 2 
    percent, well below the 3.2 percent historical trend rate of growth 
    in the United States. Although the economy has shown some welcome 
    signs of improvement of late, the Nation remains in the midst of 
    the weakest economic recovery of the modern era.
        (2) Looking ahead, CBO expects the economy to grow by an 
    average of just 2.3 percent over the next 10 years. That level of 
    economic growth is simply unacceptable and insufficient to expand 
    opportunities and the incomes of millions of middle-income 
    Americans.
        (3) Sluggish economic growth has also contributed to the 
    country's fiscal woes. Subpar growth means that revenue levels are 
    lower than they would otherwise be while government spending (e.g. 
    welfare and income-support programs) is higher. Clearly, there is a 
    dire need for policies that will spark higher rates of economic 
    growth and greater, higher-quality job opportunities.
        (4) Although job gains have been trending up of late, other 
    aspects of the labor market remain weak. The labor force 
    participation rate, for instance, is hovering just under 63 
    percent, close to the lowest level since 1978. Long-term 
    unemployment also remains a problem. Of the roughly 8.7 million 
    people who are currently unemployed, 2.7 million (more than 30 
    percent) have been unemployed for more than 6 months. Long-term 
    unemployment erodes an individual's job skills and detaches them 
    from job opportunities. It also undermines the long-term productive 
    capacity of the economy.
        (5) Perhaps most important, wage gains and income growth have 
    been subpar for middle-class Americans. Average hourly earnings of 
    private-sector workers have increased by just 1.6 percent over the 
    past year. Prior to the recession, average hourly earnings were 
    tracking close to 4 percent. Likewise, average income levels have 
    remained flat in recent years. Real median household income is just 
    under $52,000, one of the lowest levels since 1995.
        (6) The unsustainable fiscal trajectory has cast a shadow on 
    the country's economic outlook. investors and businesses make 
    decisions on a forward-looking basis. they know that today's large 
    debt levels are simply tomorrow's tax hikes, interest rate 
    increases, or inflation and they act accordingly. This debt 
    overhang, and the uncertainty it generates, can weigh on growth, 
    investment, and job creation.
        (7) Nearly all economists, including those at the CBO, conclude 
    that reducing budget deficits (thereby bending the curve on debt 
    levels is a net positive for economic growth over time. The logic 
    is that deficit reduction creates long-term economic benefits 
    because it increases the pool of national savings and boosts 
    investment, thereby raising economic growth and job creation.
        (8) CBO analyzed the House Republican fiscal year 2016 budget 
    resolution and found it would increase real output per capita (a 
    proxy for a country's standard of living) by about $1,000 in 2025 
    and roughly $5,000 by 2040 relative to the baseline path. That 
    means more income and greater prosperity for all Americans.
        (9) In contrast, if the Government remains on the current 
    fiscal path, future generations will face ever-higher debt service 
    costs, a decline in national savings, and a ``crowding out'' of 
    private investment. This dynamic will eventually lead to a decline 
    in economic output and a diminution in our country's standard of 
    living.
        (10) The key economic challenge is determining how to expand 
    the economic pie, not how best to divide up and re-distribute a 
    shrinking pie.
        (11) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels and 
    eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if annual real 
    GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over the budget 
    window, deficits would be reduced by $326 billion.
        (12) This budget resolution therefore embraces pro-growth 
    policies, such as fundamental tax reform, that will help foster a 
    stronger economy, greater opportunities and more job creation.
    (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution to 
promote faster economic growth and job creation. By putting the budget 
on a sustainable path, this concurrent resolution ends the debt-fueled 
uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code will put 
American businesses and workers in a better position to compete and 
thrive in the 21st century global economy. This concurrent resolution 
targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in 
favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this concurrent 
resolution serve as means to the larger end of helping the economy grow 
and expanding opportunity for all Americans.

SEC. 6203. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and 
    promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States tax 
    code fails on all three counts: It is notoriously complex, patently 
    unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code's complexity distorts 
    decisions to work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic 
    growth, lower wages, and less job creation.
        (2) Over the past decade alone, there have been 4,107 changes 
    to the tax code, more than one per day. Many of the major changes 
    over the years have involved carving out special preferences, 
    exclusions, or deductions for various activities or groups. These 
    loopholes add up to more than $1 trillion per year and make the 
    code unfair, inefficient, and highly complex.
        (3) In addition, these tax preferences are disproportionately 
    used by upper-income individuals.
        (4) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the code 
    end up narrowing the tax base. A narrow tax base, in turn, requires 
    much higher tax rates to raise a given amount of revenue.
        (5) It is estimated that American taxpayers end up spending 
    $160 billion and roughly 6 billion hours a year complying with the 
    tax code waste of time and resources that could be used in more 
    productive activities.
        (6) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax rates 
    dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which reduces 
    economic output and job creation. Lower economic output, in turn, 
    mutes the intended revenue gain from higher marginal tax rates.
        (7) Roughly half of United States active business income and 
    half of private sector employment are derived from business 
    entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole 
    proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, 
    meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the 
    individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure 
    rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses, in particular, 
    tend to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, and the top 
    Federal rate on such small business income can reach nearly 45 
    percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires lowering 
    marginal rates on these pass-through entities.
        (8) The United States corporate income tax rate (including 
    Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to slightly more than 39 
    percent, the highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax rates 
    this high suppress wages and discourage investment and job 
    creation, distort business activity, and put American businesses at 
    a competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors.
        (9) By deterring potential investment, the United States 
    corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The 
    United States tax rate differential with other countries also 
    fosters a variety of complicated multinational corporate behaviors 
    intended to avoid the tax, which have the effect of moving the tax 
    base offshore, destroying American jobs, and decreasing corporate 
    revenue.
        (10) The ``worldwide'' structure of United States international 
    taxation essentially taxes earnings of United States firms twice, 
    putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage with 
    competitors with more competitive international tax systems.
        (11) Reforming the United States tax code to a more competitive 
    international system would boost the competitiveness of United 
    States companies operating abroad and it would also greatly reduce 
    tax avoidance.
        (12) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through 
    lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors in 
    diminished returns.
        (13) Revenues have averaged about 17.4 percent of the economy 
    throughout modern American history. Revenues rise above this level 
    under current law to 18.3 percent of the economy by the end of the 
    10-year budget window.
        (14) Attempting to raise revenue through new tax increases to 
    meet out-of-control spending would sink the economy and Americans' 
    ability to save for their retirement and their children's 
    education.
        (15) This concurrent resolution also rejects the idea of 
    instituting a carbon tax in the United States, which some have 
    offered as a new source of revenue. Such a plan would damage the 
    economy, cost jobs, and raise prices on American consumers.
        (16) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not constitute 
    fundamental tax reform.
        (17) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate 
    loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the board 
    not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Washington has a 
    spending problem, not a revenue problem.
        (18) Many economists believe that fundamental tax reform (i.e. 
    a broader tax base and lower tax rates) would lead to greater labor 
    supply and increased investment, which, over time, would have a 
    positive impact on total national output.
        (19) Heretofore, the congressional scorekeepers the 
    Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on 
    Taxation (JCT).
        (20) Static scoring implicitly assumes that the size of the 
    economy (and therefore key economic variables such as labor supply 
    and investment) remains fixed throughout the considered budget 
    horizon. This is an abstraction from reality.
        (21) A new House of Representatives rule was adopted at the 
    beginning of the 114th Congress to help correct this problem. This 
    rule requires CBO and JCT to incorporate the macroeconomic effects 
    of major legislation into their official cost estimates.
        (22) This rule seeks to bridge the divide between static 
    estimates and scoring that incorporates economic feedback effects 
    by providing policymakers with a greater amount of information 
    about the likely economic impact of policies under their 
    consideration while at the same time preserving traditional scoring 
    methods and reporting conventions.
    (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--In the House of Representatives, it is 
the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should enact 
legislation that provides for a comprehensive reform of the United 
States tax code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, 
increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, and workers 
through fundamental tax reform that--
        (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American 
    families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and 
    resources necessary to comply with tax laws;
        (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals and 
    consolidates the current seven individual income tax brackets into 
    fewer brackets;
        (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;
        (4) reduces the corporate tax rate; and
        (5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system of 
    international taxation.

SEC. 6204. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to the 
    United States economy and beneficial to American workers and 
    consumers. The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 billion 
    of United States exports supports more than 5,000 jobs here at 
    home.
        (2) The United States can increase economic opportunities for 
    American workers and businesses through the expansion of trade, 
    adherence to trade agreement rules by the United States and its 
    trading partners, and the elimination of foreign trade barriers to 
    United States goods and services.
        (3) Trade Promotion Authority is a bipartisan and bicameral 
    effort to strengthen the role of Congress in setting negotiating 
    objectives for trade agreements, to improve consultation with 
    Congress by the Administration, and to provide a clear framework 
    for congressional consideration and implementation of trade 
    agreements.
        (4) Global trade and commerce is not a zero-sum game. The idea 
    that global expansion tends to ``hollow out'' United States 
    operations is incorrect. Foreign-affiliate activity tends to 
    complement, not substitute for, key parent activities in the United 
    States such as employment, worker compensation, and capital 
    investment. When United States headquartered multinationals invest 
    and expand operations abroad it often leads to more jobs and 
    economic growth at home.
        (5) Trade agreements have saved the average American family of 
    four more than $10,000 per year, as a result of lower duties. Trade 
    agreements also lower the cost of manufacturing inputs by removing 
    duties.
        (6) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a level 
    playing field, they can excel and surpass the international 
    competition.
        (7) When negotiating trade agreements, United States laws on 
    Intellectual Property (IP) protection should be used as a benchmark 
    for establishing global IP frameworks. Strong IP protections have 
    contributed significantly to the United States status as a world 
    leader in innovation across sectors, including in the development 
    of life-saving biologic medicines. The data protections afforded to 
    biologics in United States law, including 12 years of data 
    protection, allow continued development of pioneering medicines to 
    benefit patients both in the United States and abroad. To maintain 
    the cycle of innovation and achieve truly 21st century trade 
    agreements, it is vital that our negotiators insist on the highest 
    standards for IP protections.
        (8) The status quo of the current tax code also undermines the 
    competitiveness of United States businesses and costs the United 
    States economy investment and jobs.
        (9) The United States currently has an antiquated system of 
    international taxation whereby United States multinationals 
    operating abroad pay both the foreign-country tax and United States 
    corporate taxes. They are essentially taxed twice. This puts them 
    at an obvious competitive disadvantage. A modern and competitive 
    international tax system would facilitate global commerce for 
    United States multinational companies and would encourage foreign 
    business investment and job creation in the United States.
        (10) The ability to defer United States taxes on their foreign 
    operations, which some erroneously refer to as a ``tax loophole,'' 
    cushions this disadvantage to a certain extent. Eliminating or 
    restricting this provision (and others like it) would harm United 
    States competitiveness.
        (11) This budget resolution advocates fundamental tax reform 
    that would lower the United States corporate rate, now the highest 
    in the industrialized world, and switch to a more competitive 
    system of international taxation. This would make the United States 
    a much more attractive place to invest and station business 
    activity and would chip away at the incentives for United States 
    companies to keep their profits overseas (because the United States 
    corporate rate is so high).
    (b) Policy on Trade.--In the House of Representatives, it is the 
policy of this concurrent resolution to pursue international trade, 
global commerce, and a modern and competitive United States 
international tax system to promote job creation in the United States. 
The United States should continue to seek increased economic 
opportunities for American workers and businesses through the expansion 
of trade opportunities, adherence to trade agreements and rules by the 
United States and its trading partners, and the elimination of foreign 
trade barriers to United States goods and services by opening new 
markets and by enforcing United States rights. To that end, Congress 
should pass Trade Promotion Authority to strengthen the role of 
Congress in setting negotiating objectives for trade agreements, to 
improve consultation with Congress by the Administration, and to 
provide a clear framework for congressional consideration and 
implementation of trade agreements.

SEC. 6205. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPEALING THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE 
              LAW AND PROMOTING REAL HEALTH CARE REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) The President's health care law put Washington's priorities 
    first, and not patients'. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has failed 
    to reduce health care premiums as promised; instead, the law 
    mandated benefits and coverage levels, denying patients the 
    opportunity to choose the type of coverage that best suits their 
    health needs and driving up health coverage costs. A typical 
    family's health care premiums were supposed to decline by $2,500 a 
    year; instead, according to the 2014 Employer Health Benefits 
    Survey, health care premiums have increased by 7 percent for 
    individuals and families since 2012.
        (2) The President pledged, ``If you like your health care plan, 
    you can keep your health care plan.'' Instead, the nonpartisan 
    Congressional Budget Office now estimates 9 million Americans with 
    employment-based health coverage will lose those plans due to the 
    President's health care law, further limiting patient choice.
        (3) Then-Speaker of the House, Pelosi, said that the 
    President's health care law would create 4 million jobs over the 
    life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. Instead, the 
    Congressional Budget Office estimates that the reduction in hours 
    worked due to Obamacare represents a decline of about 2.0 to 2.5 
    million full-time equivalent workers, compared with what would have 
    occurred in the absence of the law. The full impact on labor 
    represents a reduction in employment by 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent, 
    while additional studies show less modest results. A recent study 
    by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University estimates that 
    Obamacare will reduce employment by up to 3 percent, or about 4 
    million full-time equivalent workers.
        (4) The President has charged the Independent Payment Advisory 
    Board, a panel of unelected bureaucrats, with cutting Medicare by 
    an additional $20.9 billion over the next ten years, according to 
    the President's most recent budget.
        (5) Since ACA was signed into law, the administration has 
    repeatedly failed to implement it as written. The President has 
    unilaterally acted to make a total of 28 changes, delays, and 
    exemptions. The President has signed into law another 17 changes 
    made by Congress. The Supreme Court struck down the forced 
    expansion of Medicaid; ruled the individual ``mandate'' could only 
    be characterized as a tax to remain constitutional; and rejected 
    the requirement that closely held companies provide health 
    insurance to their employees if doing so violates these companies' 
    religious beliefs. Even now, almost five years after enactment, the 
    Supreme Court continues to evaluate the legality of how the 
    President's administration has implemented the law. All of these 
    changes prove the folly underlying the entire program--health care 
    in the United States cannot be run from a centralized bureaucracy.
        (6) The President's health care law is unaffordable, intrusive, 
    overreaching, destructive, and unworkable. Its complex structure of 
    subsidies, mandates, and penalties perversely impact individuals, 
    married couples, and families. The law should be fully repealed, 
    allowing for real, patient-centered health care reform: the 
    development of real health care reforms that puts patients first, 
    that make affordable, quality health care available to all 
    Americans, and that build on the innovation and creativity of all 
    the participants in the health care sector.
    (b) Policy on Promoting Real Health Care Reform.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution that 
the President's health care law should be fully repealed and real 
health care reform promoted in accordance with the following 
principles:
        (1) In general.--Health care reform should enhance 
    affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation, choices and 
    responsiveness in health care coverage for all Americans, putting 
    patients, families, and doctors in charge, not Washington, DC. 
    These reforms should encourage increased competition and 
    transparency. Under the President's health care law, government 
    controls Americans' health care choices. Under true, patient-
    centered reform, Americans would.
        (2) Affordability.--Real reform should be centered on ensuring 
    that all Americans, no matter their age, income, or health status, 
    have the ability to afford health care coverage. The health care 
    delivery structure should be improved, and individuals should not 
    be priced out of the health insurance market due to pre-existing 
    conditions, but nationalized health care is not only unnecessary to 
    accomplish this, it undermines the goal. Individuals should be 
    allowed to join together voluntarily to pool risk through 
    mechanisms such as Individual Membership Associations and Small 
    Employer Membership Associations.
        (3) Accessability.--Instead of Washington outlining for 
    Americans the ways they cannot use their health insurance, reforms 
    should make health coverage more portable. Individuals should be 
    able to own their insurance and have it follow them in and out of 
    jobs throughout their career. Small business owners should be 
    permitted to band together across State lines through their 
    membership in bona fide trade or professional associations to 
    purchase health coverage for their families and employees at a low 
    cost. This will increase small businesses' bargaining power, volume 
    discounts, and administrative efficiencies while giving them 
    freedom from State-mandated benefit packages. Also, insurers 
    licensed to sell policies in one State should be permitted to offer 
    them to residents in any other State, and consumers should be 
    permitted to shop for health insurance across State lines, as they 
    are with other insurance products online, by mail, by phone, or in 
    consultation with an insurance agent.
        (4) Quality.--Incentives for providers to deliver high-quality, 
    responsive, and coordinated care will promote patient outcomes and 
    drive down health care costs. Likewise, reforms that work to 
    restore the patient-physician relationship by reducing 
    administrative burdens and allowing physicians to do what they do 
    best--care for patients.
        (5) Choices.--Individuals and families should be free to secure 
    the health care coverage that best meets their needs, rather than 
    instituting one-size-fits-all directives from Federal bureaucracies 
    such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and 
    Human Services, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board.
        (6) Innovation.--Instead of stifling innovation in health care 
    technologies, treatments, medications, and therapies with Federal 
    mandates, taxes, and price controls, a reformed health care system 
    should encourage research, development and innovation.
        (7) Responsiveness.--Reform should return authority to States 
    wherever possible to make the system more responsive to patients 
    and their needs. Instead of tying States' hands with Federal 
    requirements for their Medicaid programs, the Federal Government 
    should return control of this program to the States. Not only does 
    the current Medicaid program drive up Federal debt and threaten to 
    bankrupt State budgets, but States are better positioned to provide 
    quality, affordable care to those who are eligible for the program 
    and to track down and weed out waste, fraud and abuse. Beneficiary 
    choices in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) 
    and Medicaid should be improved. States should make available the 
    purchase of private insurance as an option to their Medicaid and 
    SCHIP populations (though they should not require enrollment).
        (8) Reforms.--Reforms should be made to prevent lawsuit abuse 
    and curb the practice of defensive medicine, which are significant 
    drivers increasing health care costs. The burden of proof in 
    medical malpractice cases should be based on compliance with best 
    practice guidelines, and States should be free to implement those 
    policies to best suit their needs.

SEC. 6206. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for their 
    health security.
        (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
    that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. 
    Each year without reform, the financial condition of Medicare 
    becomes more precarious and the threat to those in or near 
    retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the Medicare 
    Trustees Report--
            (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 
        2030 and unable to pay scheduled benefits;
            (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to increase by over 50 
        percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 baby boomers reach 
        retirement age each day;
            (C) enrollees remain in Medicare three times longer than at 
        the outset of the program;
            (D) current workers' payroll contributions pay for current 
        beneficiaries;
            (E) in 2013, the ratio was 3.2 workers per beneficiary, but 
        this falls to 2.3 in 2030 and continues to decrease over time;
            (F) most Medicare beneficiaries receive about three dollars 
        in Medicare benefits for every one dollar paid into the 
        program; and
            (G) Medicare spending is growing faster than the economy 
        and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a rate of 6.5 
        percent per year over the next 10 years. According to the 
        Congressional Budget Office's 2014 Long-Term Budget Outlook, 
        spending on Medicare is projected to reach 5 percent of gross 
        domestic product (GDP) by 2043 and 9.3 percent of GDP by 2089.
        (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
    American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
    generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending levels 
    that cannot be sustained.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--In the House of Representatives, it 
is the policy of this concurrent resolution to preserve the program for 
those in or near retirement and strengthen Medicare for future 
beneficiaries.
    (c) Assumptions.--This concurrent resolution assumes reform of the 
Medicare program such that--
        (1) current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or 
    near retirement;
        (2) permanent reform of the sustainable growth rate is 
    responsibly accounted for to ensure physicians continue to 
    participate in the Medicare program and provide quality health care 
    for beneficiaries;
        (3) when future generations reach eligibility, Medicare is 
    reformed to provide a premium support payment and a selection of 
    guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can choose 
    a plan that best suits their needs;
        (4) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as a 
    plan option;
        (5) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower 
    income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks; and
        (6) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
    Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.

SEC. 6207. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAL DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, DELIVERY 
              AND INNOVATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) For decades, the Nation's commitment to the discovery, 
    development, and delivery of new treatments and cures has made the 
    United States the biomedical innovation capital of the world, 
    bringing life-saving drugs and devices to patients and well over a 
    million high-paying jobs to local communities.
        (2) Thanks to the visionary and determined leadership of 
    innovators throughout America, including industry, academic medical 
    centers, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the United 
    States has led the way in early discovery. The United States 
    leadership role is being threatened, however, as other countries 
    contribute more to basic research from both public and private 
    sources.
        (3) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
    predicts that China, for example, will outspend the United States 
    in total research and development by the end of the decade.
        (4) Federal policies should foster innovation in health care, 
    not stifle it. America should maintain its world leadership in 
    medical science by encouraging competitive forces to work through 
    the marketplace in delivering cures and therapies to patients.
        (5) Too often the bureaucracy and red-tape in Washington hold 
    back medical innovation and prevent new lifesaving treatments from 
    reaching patients. This concurrent resolution recognizes the 
    valuable role of the NIH and the indispensable contributions to 
    medical research coming from outside Washington.
        (6) America is the greatest, most innovative Nation on Earth. 
    Her people are innovators, entrepreneurs, visionaries, and 
    relentless builders of the future. Americans were responsible for 
    the first telephone, the first airplane, the first computer, for 
    putting the first man on the moon, for creating the first vaccine 
    for polio and for legions of other scientific and medical 
    breakthroughs that have improved and prolonged human health and 
    life for countless people in America and around the world.
    (b) Policy on Medical Innovation.--
        (1) In the House of Representatives, it is the policy of this 
    concurrent resolution to support the important work of medical 
    innovators throughout the country, including private-sector 
    innovators, medical centers and the National Institutes of Health.
        (2) At the same time, the budget calls for continued strong 
    funding for the agencies that engage in valuable research and 
    development, while also urging Washington to get out of the way of 
    researchers, discoverers and innovators all over the country.

SEC. 6208. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) Excessive regulation at the Federal level has hurt job 
    creation and dampened the economy, slowing the Nation's recovery 
    from the economic recession.
        (2) Since President Obama's inauguration in 2009, the 
    administration has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations in 
    the Federal Register including 70,066 pages in 2014.
        (3) The National Association of Manufacturers estimates the 
    total cost of regulations is as high as $2.03 trillion per year. 
    Since 2009, the White House has generated more than $494 billion in 
    regulatory activity, with an additional $87.6 billion in regulatory 
    costs currently pending.
        (4) The Dodd-Frank financial services legislation (Public Law 
    111-203) has resulted in more than $32 billion in compliance costs 
    and saddled job creators with more than 63 million hours of 
    compliance paperwork.
        (5) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act to date has added 
    132.9 million annual hours of compliance paperwork, imposing $24.3 
    billion of compliance costs on the private sector and an $8 billion 
    cost burden on the States.
        (6) The highest regulatory costs come from rules issued by the 
    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); these regulations are 
    primarily targeted at the coal industry. In June 2014, the EPA 
    proposed a rule to cut carbon pollution from the Nation's power 
    plants. The proposed standards are unachievable with current 
    commercially available technology, resulting in a de-facto ban on 
    new coal-fired power plants.
        (7) Coal-fired power plants provide roughly 40 percent of the 
    United States electricity at a low cost. Unfairly targeting the 
    coal industry with costly and unachievable regulations will 
    increase energy prices, disproportionately disadvantaging energy-
    intensive industries like manufacturing and construction, and will 
    make life more difficult for millions of low-income and middle 
    class families already struggling to pay their bills.
        (8) Three hundred and thirty coal units are being retired or 
    converted as a result of EPA regulations. Combined with the de-
    facto prohibition on new plants, these retirements and conversions 
    may further increase the cost of electricity.
        (9) A recent study by the energy market analysis group Energy 
    Ventures Analysis Inc. estimates the average energy bill in West 
    Virginia will rise $750 per household by 2020, due in part to EPA 
    regulations. West Virginia receives 95 percent of its electricity 
    from coal.
        (10) The Heritage Foundation found that a phase-out of coal 
    would cost 600,000 jobs by the end of 2023, resulting in an 
    aggregate gross domestic product decrease of $2.23 trillion over 
    the entire period and reducing the income of a family of four by 
    $1,200 per year. Of these jobs, 330,000 will come from the 
    manufacturing sector, with California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, 
    Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, Indiana, North Carolina, 
    Wisconsin, and Georgia seeing the highest job losses.
    (b) Policy on Federal Regulatory Reform.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution that 
Congress should, in consultation with the public burdened by excessive 
regulation, enact legislation that--
        (1) promotes economic growth and job creation by eliminating 
    unnecessary red tape and streamlining and simplifying Federal 
    regulations;
        (2) requires the implementation of a regulatory budget to be 
    allocated amongst Government agencies, which would require 
    congressional approval and limit the maximum costs of regulations 
    in a given year;
        (3) requires congressional approval of all new major 
    regulations (those with an impact of $100 million or more) before 
    enactment as opposed to current law in which Congress must 
    expressly disapprove of regulation to prevent it from becoming law, 
    which would keep Congress engaged as to pending regulatory policy 
    and prevent costly and unsound policies from being implemented and 
    becoming effective;
        (4) requires a three year retrospective cost-benefit analysis 
    of all new major regulations, to ensure that regulations operate as 
    intended;
        (5) reinforces the requirement of regulatory impact analysis 
    for regulations proposed by executive branch agencies but also 
    expands the requirement to independent agencies so that by law they 
    consider the costs and benefits of proposed regulations rather than 
    merely being encouraged to do so as is current practice; and
        (6) requires a formal rulemaking process for all major 
    regulations, which would increase transparency over the process and 
    allow interested parties to communicate their views on proposed 
    legislation to agency officials.

SEC. 6209. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE 
              DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY.

    (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House of Representatives 
finds the following:
        (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, and 
    wage growth.
        (2) Roughly 20 million students are enrolled in American 
    colleges and universities.
        (3) Over the past decade, tuition and fees have been growing at 
    an unsustainable rate. Between the 2004-2005 Academic Year and the 
    2014-2015 Academic Year--
            (A) published tuition and fees at public 4-year colleges 
        and universities increased at an average rate of 3.5 percent 
        per year above the rate of inflation;
            (B) published tuition and fees at public two-year colleges 
        and universities increased at an average rate of 2.5 percent 
        per year above the rate of inflation; and
            (C) published tuition and fees at private nonprofit 4-year 
        colleges and universities increased at an average rate of 2.2 
        percent per year above the rate of inflation.
        (4) Federal financial aid for higher education has also seen a 
    dramatic increase. The portion of the Federal student aid portfolio 
    composed of Direct Loans, Federal Family Education Loans, and 
    Perkins Loans with outstanding balances grew by 119 percent between 
    fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2014.
        (5) This spending has failed to make college more affordable.
        (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama 
    noted: ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll 
    run out of money''.
        (7) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition with 
    ever-increasing debt. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
    York, student debt now stands at nearly $1.2 trillion. This makes 
    student loans the second largest balance of consumer debt, after 
    mortgage debt.
        (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and too many fail to 
    complete college or end up defaulting on these loans due to their 
    debt burden and a weak economy and job market.
        (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, 
    the Pell Grant Program will face a fiscal shortfall beginning in 
    fiscal year 2017 and continuing in each subsequent year in the 
    current budget window.
        (10) Failing to address these problems will jeopardize access 
    and affordability to higher education for America's young people.
    (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution to 
address the root drivers of tuition inflation, by--
        (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need;
        (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to make them more 
    effective;
        (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level at $5,775 in 
    each year of the budget window; and
        (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that act 
    to restrict flexibility and innovative teaching, particularly as it 
    relates to non-traditional models such as online coursework and 
    competency-based learning.
    (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House of 
Representatives finds the following:
        (1) 8.7 million Americans are currently unemployed.
        (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking for 
    work are stymied by a broken workforce development system that 
    fails to connect workers with assistance and employers with trained 
    personnel.
        (3) The House Education and Workforce Committee successfully 
    consolidated 15 job training programs in the recently enacted 
    Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
    (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution to 
address the failings in the current workforce development system, by--
        (1) further streamlining and consolidating Federal job training 
    programs; and
        (2) empowering states with the flexibility to tailor funding 
    and programs to the specific needs of their workforce, including 
    the development of career scholarships.

SEC. 6210. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) For years, there has been serious concern regarding the 
    Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) bureaucratic mismanagement and 
    continuous failure to provide veterans timely access to health care 
    and benefits.
        (2) In 2014, reports started breaking across the Nation that VA 
    medical centers were manipulating wait-list documents to hide long 
    delays veterans were facing to receive health care. The VA hospital 
    scandal led to the immediate resignation of then-Secretary of 
    Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki.
        (3) In 2015, for the first time ever, VA health care was added 
    to the ``high-risk'' list of the Government Accountability Office 
    (GAO), due to management and oversight failures that have directly 
    resulted in risks to the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and 
    quality of health care.
        (4) In response to the scandal, the House Committee on 
    Veterans' Affairs held several oversight hearings and ultimately 
    enacted the Veterans' Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 
    (VACAA) (Public Law 113-146) to address these problems. VACAA 
    provided $15 billion in emergency resources to fund internal health 
    care needs within the department and provided veterans enhanced 
    access to private-sector health care under the new Veterans Choice 
    Program.
    (b) Policy on the Department of Veterans Affairs.--This budget 
supports the continued oversight efforts by the Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs of the House of Representatives to ensure the VA is not only 
transparent and accountable, but also successful in achieving its goals 
in providing timely health care and benefits to America's veterans. The 
Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives will continue 
to closely monitor the VA's progress to ensure resources provided by 
Congress are sufficient and efficiently used to provide needed benefits 
and services to veterans.

SEC. 6211. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) Given the thousands of Federal programs and trillions of 
    dollars the Federal Government spends each year, assessing and 
    accounting for Federal fiscal activities and liabilities is a 
    complex undertaking.
        (2) Current methods of accounting leave much to be desired in 
    capturing the full scope of government and in presenting 
    information in a clear and compelling way that illuminates the best 
    options going forward.
        (3) Most fiscal analysis produced by the Congressional Budget 
    Office (CBO) is conducted over a relatively short time horizon: 10 
    or 25 years. While this time frame is useful for most purposes, it 
    fails to consider the fiscal consequences over the longer term.
        (4) Additionally, current accounting methodology does not 
    provide an analysis of how the Federal Government's fiscal 
    situation over the long run affects Americans of various age 
    cohorts.
        (5) Another consideration is how Federal programs should be 
    accounted for. The ``accrual method'' of accounting records revenue 
    when it is earned and expenses when they are incurred, while the 
    ``cash method'' records revenue and expenses when cash is actually 
    paid or received.
        (6) The Federal budget accounts for most programs using cash 
    accounting. Some programs, however, particularly loan and loan 
    guarantee programs, are accounted for using accrual methods.
        (7) GAO has indicated that accrual accounting may provide a 
    more accurate estimation of the Federal Government's liabilities 
    than cash accounting for some programs specifically those that 
    provide some form of insurance.
        (8) Where accrual accounting is used, it is almost exclusively 
    calculated by CBO according to the methodology outlined in the 
    Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). CBO uses fair value 
    methodology instead of FCRA to measure the cost of Fannie Mae and 
    Freddie Mac, for example.
        (9) FCRA methodology, however, understates the risk and thus 
    the true cost of Federal programs. An alternative is fair value 
    methodology, which uses discount rates that incorporate the risk 
    inherent to the type of liability being estimated in addition to 
    Treasury discount rates of the proper maturity length.
        (10) The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that 
    ``adopting a fair-value approach would provide a more comprehensive 
    way to measure the costs of Federal credit programs and would 
    permit more level comparisons between those costs and the costs of 
    other forms of federal assistance'' than the current approach under 
    FCRA.
    (b) Policy on Federal Accounting Methodologies.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution that 
Congress should, in consultation with the Congressional Budget Office 
and the public affected by Federal budgetary choices, adopt Government-
wide reforms of budget and accounting practices so the American people 
and their representatives can more readily understand the fiscal 
situation of the Government of the United States and the options best 
suited to improving it. Such reforms may include but should not be 
limited to the following:
        (1) Providing additional metrics to enhance our current 
    analysis by considering our fiscal situation comprehensively, over 
    an extended time horizon, and as it affects Americans of various 
    age cohorts.
        (2) Expanding the use of accrual accounting where appropriate.
        (3) Accounting for certain Federal credit programs using fair 
    value accounting as opposed to the current approach under the 
    Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.

SEC. 6212. POLICY STATEMENT ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY, WASTEFUL, AND 
              UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required by 
    law to identify examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in 
    Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of such examples.
        (2) In its report to Congress on Government Efficiency and 
    Effectiveness, the Comptroller General has stated that addressing 
    the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal programs 
    could ``lead to tens of billions of dollars of additional 
    savings.''.
        (3) In 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 the GAO issued reports 
    showing excessive duplication and redundancy in Federal programs 
    including--
            (A) two hundred nine Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
        Mathematics education programs in 13 different Federal agencies 
        at a cost of $3 billion annually;
            (B) two hundred separate Department of Justice crime 
        prevention and victim services grant programs with an annual 
        cost of $3.9 billion in 2010;
            (C) twenty different Federal entities administer 160 
        housing programs and other forms of Federal assistance for 
        housing with a total cost of $170 billion in 2010;
            (D) seventeen separate Homeland Security preparedness grant 
        programs that spent $37 billion between fiscal years 2011 and 
        2012;
            (E) fourteen grant and loan programs, and three tax 
        benefits to reduce diesel emissions;
            (F) ninety-four different initiatives run by 11 different 
        agencies to encourage ``green building'' in the private sector; 
        and
            (G) twenty-three agencies implemented approximately 670 
        renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010 at a cost of 
        nearly $15 billion.
        (4) The Federal Government spends more than $80 billion each 
    year for approximately 1,400 information technology investments. 
    GAO has identified broad acquisition failures, waste, and 
    unnecessary duplication in the Government's information technology 
    infrastructure. experts have estimated that eliminating these 
    problems could save 25 percent or $20 billion.
        (5) GAO has identified strategic sourcing as a potential source 
    of spending reductions. In 2011 GAO estimated that saving 10 
    percent of the total or all Federal procurement could generate more 
    than $50 billion in savings annually.
        (6) Federal agencies reported an estimated $106 billion in 
    improper payments in fiscal year 2013.
        (7) Under clause 2 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
    Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least one 
    hearing during each 120 day period following its establishment on 
    waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government programs.
        (8) According to the Congressional Budget Office, by fiscal 
    year 2015, 32 laws will expire, possibly resulting in $693 billion 
    in unauthorized appropriations. Timely reauthorizations of these 
    laws would ensure assessments of program justification and 
    effectiveness.
        (9) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of 
    Federal Government programs should result in programmatic changes 
    in both authorizing statutes and program funding levels.
    (b) Policy on Reducing Unnecessary, Wasteful, and Unauthorized 
Spending.--
        (1) Each authorizing committee of the House of Representatives 
    annually should include in its Views and Estimates letter required 
    under section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
    recommendations to the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
    Representatives of programs within the jurisdiction of such 
    committee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated.
        (2) Committees of jurisdiction should review all unauthorized 
    programs funded through annual appropriations to determine if the 
    programs are operating efficiently and effectively.
        (3) Committees should reauthorize those programs that in the 
    committees' judgment should continue to receive funding.
        (4) For those programs not reauthorized by committees, the 
    House of Representatives should enforce the limitations on funding 
    such unauthorized programs in the House rules. If the strictures of 
    the rules are deemed to be too rapid in prohibiting spending on 
    unauthorized programs, then milder measures should be adopted and 
    enforced until a return to the full prohibition of clause 2(a)(1) 
    of rule XXI of the Rules of the House.

SEC. 6213. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
              CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office of 
    Management and Budget, Federal agencies were expected to hold $844 
    billion in unobligated balances at the close of fiscal year 2015.
        (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending 
    previously made available by Congress that remains available for 
    expenditure.
        (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it remains 
    available for obligation indefinitely.
        (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
    1974 requires the Office of Management and Budget to make funds 
    available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the 
    Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds 
    unless approved by an Act of Congress.
        (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review and 
    identify potential savings from canceling unobligated balances of 
    funds that are no longer needed.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
Unobligated Balances.--In the House of Representatives, committees 
should through their oversight activities identify and achieve savings 
through the cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that 
neither abrogate contractual obligations of the Government nor reduce 
or disrupt Federal commitments under programs such as Social Security, 
veterans' affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance 
the national debt.
    (c) Deficit Reduction.--The House of Representatives, with the 
assistance of the Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors 
General, and other appropriate agencies should continue to make it a 
high priority to review unobligated balances and identify savings for 
deficit reduction.

SEC. 6214. POLICY STATEMENT ON AGENCY FEES AND SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) A number of Federal agencies and organizations have 
    permanent authority to collect fees and other offsetting 
    collections and to spend these collected funds.
        (2) The total amount of offsetting fees and offsetting 
    collections is estimated by the Office of Management and Budget to 
    be $525 billion in fiscal year 2016.
        (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not fully 
    transparent about the amount of program activity funded through 
    offsetting collections or fees. This lack of transparency prevents 
    effective and accountable government.
    (b) Policy on Agency Fees and Spending.--In the House of 
Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent resolution that 
Congress must reassert its constitutional prerogative to control 
spending and conduct oversight. To do so, Congress should enact 
legislation requiring programs that are funded through fees, offsetting 
receipts, or offsetting collections to be allocated new budget 
authority annually. Such allocation may arise from--
        (1) legislation originating from the authorizing committee of 
    jurisdiction for the agency or program; or
        (2) fee and account specific allocations included in annual 
    appropriation Acts.

SEC. 6215. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER 
              DOLLARS.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) The budget for the House of Representatives is $188 million 
    less than it was when Republicans became the majority in 2011.
        (2) The House of Representatives has achieved significant 
    savings by consolidating operations and renegotiating contracts.
    (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.--In the 
House of Representatives, it is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution that:
        (1) The House of Representatives must be a model for the 
    responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources and therefore must 
    identify any savings that can be achieved through greater 
    productivity and efficiency gains in the operation and maintenance 
    of House services and resources like printing, conferences, 
    utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds maintenance, 
    postage, and rent. This should include a review of policies and 
    procedures for acquisition of goods and services to eliminate any 
    unnecessary spending. The Committee on House Administration should 
    review the policies pertaining to the services provided to Members 
    and committees of the House of Representatives, and should identify 
    ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the operation of the House 
    gym, barber shop, salon, and the House dining room.
        (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class 
    airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.
        (3) Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not 
    include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.

SEC. 6216. POLICY STATEMENT ON ``NO BUDGET, NO PAY''.

    In the House of Representatives, it is the policy of this 
concurrent resolution that Congress should agree to a concurrent 
resolution on the budget every year pursuant to section 301 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974. If by April 15, the House of 
Representatives has not agreed to a concurrent resolution on the 
budget, the payroll administrator of the House of Representatives 
should carry out this policy in the same manner as the provisions of 
Public Law 113-3, the No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013, and should place 
in an escrow account all compensation otherwise required to be made for 
Members of the House of Representatives. Withheld compensation should 
be released to Members of the House of Representatives the earlier of 
the day on which the House of Representatives agrees to a concurrent 
resolution on the budget, pursuant to section 301 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, or the last day of that Congress.

SEC. 6217. POLICY STATEMENT ON NATIONAL SECURITY FUNDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House of Representatives finds the following:
        (1) Russian aggression, the growing threats of the Islamic 
    State of Iraq and the Levant in the Middle East, North Korean and 
    Iranian nuclear and missile programs, and continued Chinese 
    investments in high-end military capabilities and cyber warfare 
    shape the parameters of an increasingly complex and challenging 
    security environment.
        (2) All four current service chiefs testified that the National 
    Military Strategy could not be executed at sequestration levels.
        (3) The independent and bipartisan National Defense Panel 
    conducted risk assessments of force structure changes triggered by 
    the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) and concluded that in addition 
    to previous cuts to defense dating back to 2009, the sequestration 
    of defense discretionary spending has ``caused significant 
    shortfalls in U.S. military readiness and both present and future 
    capabilities''.
        (4) The President's fiscal year 2016 budget irresponsibly 
    ignores current law and requests a defense budget $38 billion above 
    the caps for rhetorical gain. By creating an expectation of 
    spending without a plan to avoid the BCA's guaranteed sequester 
    upon breaching of its caps, the White House's proposal compounds 
    the fiscal uncertainty that has affected the military's ability to 
    adequately plan for future contingencies and make investments 
    crucial for the Nation's defense.
        (5) The President's budget proposes $1.8 trillion in tax 
    increases, in addition to the $1.7 trillion in tax hikes the 
    Administration has already imposed. The President's tax increases 
    would further burden economic growth and is not a realistic source 
    for offsets to fund defense sequester replacement.
    (b) Policy on Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Funding.--In fiscal 
year 2015, the House-passed budget resolution anticipated $566 billion 
for national defense in the discretionary base budget for fiscal year 
2016. With no necessary statutory change yet provided by Congress, the 
BCA statute would require limiting national defense discretionary base 
funding to $523 billion in fiscal year 2016. However, in total with $90 
billion, the House of Representatives Budget estimate for Overseas 
Contingency Operations funding for the Department of Defense, the 
fiscal year 2016 budget provides over $613 billion total for defense 
spending that is higher than the President's budget request for the 
fiscal year.
    (c) Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund.--(1) The budget 
resolution recognizes the need to ensure robust funding for national 
defense while maintaining overall fiscal discipline. The budget 
resolution prioritizes our national defense and the needs of the 
warfighter by providing needed dollars through the creation of the 
``Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund''.
    (2) The Defense Readiness and Modernization Fund provides the 
mechanism for Congress to responsibly allocate in a deficit-neutral way 
the resources the military needs to secure the safety and liberty of 
United States citizens from threats at home and abroad. The Defense 
Readiness and Modernization Fund will provide the chair of the 
Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives the ability to 
increase allocations to support legislation that would provide for the 
Department of Defense warfighting capabilities, modernization, training 
and maintenance associated with combat readiness, activities to reach 
full auditability of the Department of Defense's financial statements, 
and implementation of military and compensation reforms.
    (d) Sequester Replacement for National Defense.--This concurrent 
resolution encourages an immediate reevaluation of Federal Government 
priorities to maintain the strength of America's national security 
posture. In identifying policies to restructure and stabilize the 
Government's major entitlement programs which, along with net interest, 
will consume all Federal revenue in less than 20 years, the budget also 
charts a course that can ensure the availability of needed national 
security resources.
