includes any provision or provisions affecting the Crime Victims Fund, 
as defined by section 1402 of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42

would have been estimated as affecting direct spending or receipts 
under section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 (as in effect prior to September 30, 2002) were they 
included in legislation other than appropriations legislation. A point

point of order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of order 
as to some of the provisions (including provisions of an amendment, 
motion, or conference report) against which the Senator raised the 
point of order, then only those provisions (including provision of an 
amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Presiding 
Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant 
to this section. Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of 
order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order as it 
applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of 
order was raised. Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance

amendment shall be stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to consider 
the question of whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and 
concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with 
a further amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment shall 
consist of only that portion of the conference report or House 
amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion shall 
be debatable. In any case in which such point of order is sustained 
against a conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such 
conference report by operation of this subsection), no further 
amendment shall be in order.
