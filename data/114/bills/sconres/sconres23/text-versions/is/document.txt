                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the establishment of a bipartisan Museum Study Commission to 
study the establishment of a National Museum of the American People to 
tell the immigration and migration stories of all people of the United 
                                States.

Whereas the United States was founded and built by people from every country who 
        made the United States the economic, military, scientific, and cultural 
        leader of the world;
Whereas as of October 2015, there is no national museum in Washington, DC, 
        that--

    (1) celebrates the making of the people of the United States; or

    (2) tells the migration history of any group of people to or within the 
United States;

Whereas a National Museum of the American People would--

    (1) recount the history of all groups of people who came to the United 
States and the contributions of those people to the United States;

    (2) have the theme E Pluribus Unum, the original motto of the United 
States;

    (3) celebrate every ethnic and minority group in the United States;

    (4) foster a sense of belonging to the United States;

    (5) contribute to a common national identity as people of the United 
States;

    (6) highlight the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the 
founding documents of the United States;

    (7) explore the ways in which those documents shaped the character of 
the people of the United States and infused the people of the United States 
with common values; and

    (8) be a resource for State, local, and ethnic museums throughout the 
United States that present exhibits that celebrate the heritage of the 
people of the United States;

Whereas the people of the United States do not have a comprehensive and accurate 
        picture of the history of all of the people who founded and continue to 
        build the United States;
Whereas people from every ethnic group in the United States would visit a 
        National Museum of the American People to learn their own history and 
        the history of every other ethnic group in the United States;
Whereas a National Museum of the American People would attract foreign visitors 
        and dignitaries because few foreigners know the story of the individuals 
        who--

    (1) became citizens of the United States at the founding of the 
country; and

    (2) migrated to the United States from other countries;

Whereas a museum that tells the story of the making of the people of the United 
        States and celebrates all individuals who migrated and settled in the 
        United States and the territories of the United States belongs near the 
        National Mall in Washington, DC;
Whereas Canada and Mexico have major popular museums in, or adjacent to, the 
        capital cities of those countries that tell the story of the making of 
        the people of Canada and Mexico, respectively;
Whereas the goals of a National Museum of the American People would be--

    (1) to be the best storytelling museum in the world;

    (2) to recount 1 of the most amazing stories in human history;

    (3) to celebrate all of the people who have become people of the United 
States; and

    (4) to foster learning at the museum and throughout the United States;

Whereas non-Federal funding sources will be sought to defray the costs of a 
        Museum Study Commission to study the establishment of a National Museum 
        of the American People and the funding will commence on the date on 
        which the President signs an Executive order creating the bipartisan 
        commission;
Whereas no Federal appropriations will be sought to provide funding for--

    (1) the design, construction, or operation a National Museum of the 
American People; or

    (2) the exhibitions or components of the museum; and

Whereas the National Museum of the American People will benefit all people of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress supports the establishment of a bipartisan Museum Study 
Commission to study the establishment of a National Museum of the 
American People to tell the immigration and migration stories of all 
people of the United States, if none of the funding to plan, construct, 
or operate the museum is from Federal appropriations.
