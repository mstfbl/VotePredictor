                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax is not in the 
                economic interest of the United States.

Whereas a carbon tax is regressive in nature and would unfairly burden those 
        vulnerable individuals and families in the United States that are 
        already struggling with increasing electricity rates and a slow economic 
        recovery;
Whereas a carbon tax would increase the cost of every good manufactured in the 
        United States;
Whereas a carbon tax would harm the entire United States manufacturing sector;
Whereas European nations that have adopted carbon policies and regulatory 
        regimes have forced energy poverty on their citizens and undermined 
        their economies;
Whereas the increase in production of domestic fossil energy resources on 
        private and State-owned land has created significant job growth and 
        private capital investment; and
Whereas affordable and reliable energy sources are critical to maintaining the 
        United States global competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental 
to families and businesses in the United States, and is not in the 
interest of the United States.
