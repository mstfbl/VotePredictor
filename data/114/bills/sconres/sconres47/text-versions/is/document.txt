                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for fostering closer economic and commercial ties 
between the United States and the United Kingdom following the decision 
   of the people of the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European 
                                 Union.

Whereas the United States and the United Kingdom are allies with a long 
        tradition of working in close cooperation to support one another's 
        mutual interests;
Whereas the United Kingdom is the world's fifth largest economy and one of the 
        most important trading and economic partners of the United States;
Whereas expanding United States trade with the United Kingdom has the potential 
        to benefit American businesses, farmers, ranchers, workers, and 
        consumers;
Whereas a strong and economically vibrant United Kingdom capable of supporting 
        global economic growth and promoting shared Anglo-American economic 
        principles is in the national interest of the United States;
Whereas the voluntary exchange of goods and services among citizens of nations 
        helps provide global economic stability, especially in times of economic 
        uncertainty;
Whereas the United States also continues to support the member states of the 
        European Union and seeks the further enhancement of economic and 
        commercial ties between the United States and the European Union, 
        including through the conclusion of a high-standard Transatlantic Trade 
        and Investment Partnership; and
Whereas orderly and cooperative negotiations between the United Kingdom and the 
        European Union that uphold the fundamental bases for trade and 
        investment between the United Kingdom and the European Union are in the 
        mutual interest of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the member 
        states of the European Union: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) calls upon the President to consult with the Senate and 
        the House of Representatives to consider opportunities to 
        promote further economic and commercial activity and 
        cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom, 
        including by way of a trade agreement between the United States 
        and the United Kingdom;
            (2) calls upon the President to invite the United Kingdom 
        to begin discussions towards establishing the basis for 
        negotiations for a trade agreement between the United States 
        and the United Kingdom;
            (3) recalls that section 103(d) of the Bipartisan 
        Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 
        (19 U.S.C. 4202(d)) directs the President to commence 
        negotiations covering tariff and nontariff barriers to United 
        States trade where the President determines that such 
        negotiations are feasible and timely and would benefit the 
        United States;
            (4) recalls further that section 102 of the Bipartisan 
        Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 
        (19 U.S.C. 4201) sets forth the negotiating objectives of the 
        United States, and that the Senate and the House of 
        Representatives expect that these congressionally mandated 
        negotiating objectives will be achieved in any United States 
        trade agreement;
            (5) urges the President, throughout discussions with the 
        United Kingdom and in close consultation with the Senate and 
        the House of Representatives, to determine whether negotiation 
        of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom would be likely to 
        achieve the negotiating objectives established by the 
        Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability 
        Act of 2015 and, if such negotiation would be likely to achieve 
        such objectives, to commence negotiations towards a trade 
        agreement with the United Kingdom as soon as appropriate;
            (6) expresses support for enhanced economic and commercial 
        ties between the United States and the European Union, 
        including through the conclusion of a high-standard 
        Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership;
            (7) notes that the continued movement of goods, services, 
        and capital between the United Kingdom and the European Union 
        is important to American businesses invested in Europe and the 
        United States economy generally; and
            (8) calls upon the European Union and the United Kingdom to 
        work constructively to achieve a climate for trade and 
        investment that is mutually beneficial and productive.
