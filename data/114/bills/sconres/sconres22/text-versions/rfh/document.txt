                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the White House Fellows program.

Whereas in 1964, John W. Gardner presented the idea of selecting a handful of 
        outstanding men and women to come to Washington, DC to participate as 
        White House Fellows and learn the workings of the highest levels of the 
        Government, learn about leadership as they observed the officials of the 
        United States in action, and meet with these officials and other leaders 
        of society;
Whereas John W. Gardner believed that serving as Fellows would strengthen the 
        abilities and desires of the Fellows to contribute to their communities, 
        their professions, and their country;
Whereas President Lyndon B. Johnson established the President's Commission on 
        White House Fellowships through Executive Order 11183 (October 3, 1964) 
        to create a program that would select between 11 and 19 outstanding 
        young people of the United States every year and bring them to 
        Washington, DC for ``first hand, high-level experience in the workings 
        of the Federal Government, to establish an era when the young men and 
        women of America and their government belonged to each other--belonged 
        to each other in fact and in spirit'';
Whereas the White House Fellows program has steadfastly remained a nonpartisan 
        program that has served and been supported by 9 Presidents exceptionally 
        well;
Whereas the 725 White House Fellows who have served have established a legacy of 
        leadership in every aspect of our society, including--

    (1) appointments as Cabinet officers, ambassadors, special envoys, 
United States Attorneys, deputy and assistant secretaries of departments, 
and senior White House staff;

    (2) election to the House of Representatives, the Senate, and State and 
local government;

    (3) appointments to the Federal, State, and local judiciary;

    (4) leadership in many of the largest corporations and law firms in the 
United States; and

    (5) service as presidents of colleges and universities, deans of the 
most distinguished graduate schools in the United States, officials in 
nonprofit organizations, leaders in national journalism and the working 
press, senior leaders in every branch of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, and distinguished scholars and historians;

Whereas the legacy of leadership of the White House Fellows program is a 
        national resource that has served the United States in major challenges, 
        including--

    (1) organizing resettlement operations following the Vietnam War;

    (2) assisting with the national response to terrorist attacks;

    (3) managing the aftermath of natural disasters, such as Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita;

    (4) providing support to earthquake victims in Haiti and Nepal;

    (5) serving in the Armed Forces of the United States in Iraq and 
Afghanistan; and

    (6) reforming and innovating in national and international securities 
and capital markets;

Whereas the post-Fellowship years of the 725 White House Fellows are 
        characterized by a demonstrable lifetime commitment to public service 
        through continuing personal and professional renewal and association, 
        creating a White House Fellows Community of Mutual Support for 
        leadership at every level of government and in every element of life in 
        the United States; and
Whereas, September 1, 2015, marked the 50th anniversary of the first class of 
        White House Fellows to serve the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of the White House 
        Fellows program and commends the White House Fellows for their 
        continuing lifetime commitment to public service;
            (2) acknowledges the legacy of leadership provided by White 
        House Fellows over the years in their local communities, the 
        United States, and the world; and
            (3) expresses appreciation and support for the continuing 
        leadership of White House Fellows in all aspects of the 
        national life of the United States in the years ahead.

            Passed the Senate October 6, 2015.

            Attest:

                                                JULIE E. ADAMS,

                                                             Secretary.
