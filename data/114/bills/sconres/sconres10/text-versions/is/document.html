                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of the year of 2015 as the ``International 
     Year of Soils'' and supporting locally led soil conservation.

Whereas many of the international partners of the United States are designating 
        2015 as the ``International Year of Soils'';
Whereas soil is vitally important for food security and essential ecosystem 
        functions;
Whereas soil conservation efforts in the United States are often locally led;
Whereas 2015 also marks the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Soil 
        Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.) on 
        April 27, 1935;
Whereas soils, as the foundation for agricultural production, essential 
        ecosystem functions, and food security, are key to sustaining life on 
        Earth;
Whereas soils and the science of soils contribute to improved water quality, 
        food safety and security, healthy ecosystems, and human health; and
Whereas soil, plant, animal, and human health are intricately linked: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the designation of 2015 as the ``International 
        Year of Soils'';
            (2) encourages the public to participate in activities that 
        celebrate the importance of soils to the current and future 
        well-being of the United States; and
            (3) supports conservation of the soils of the United 
        States, through--
                    (A) partnership with local soil and water 
                conservation districts; and
                    (B) landowner participation in--

                        established under subchapter B of chapter 2 of 
                        subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security 
                        Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3838D et seq.);
                            (iv) the agricultural conservation easement
