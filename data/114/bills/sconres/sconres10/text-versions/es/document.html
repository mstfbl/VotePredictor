                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas many of the international partners of the United States are designating 
        2015 as the ``International Year of Soils'';
Whereas soil is vitally important for food security and essential ecosystem 
        functions;
Whereas soil conservation efforts in the United States are often locally led;
Whereas 2015 also marks the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Soil 
        Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590a et seq.) on 
        April 27, 1935;
Whereas soils, as the foundation for agricultural production, essential 
        ecosystem functions, and food security, are key to sustaining life on 
        Earth;
Whereas soils and the science of soils contribute to improved water quality, 
        food safety and security, healthy ecosystems, and human health; and
Whereas soil, plant, animal, and human health are intricately linked: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),
