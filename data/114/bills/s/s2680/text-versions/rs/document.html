&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, shall, directly or through a

distributed to States and territories according to need, and to

        services, and the ability of the States to pay for such 
        services;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the impact that the minimum allotment 
        provisions under each such block grant have on each State's

        minimum allotment provisions to ensure an appropriate 
        distribution of funds; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        with such section.

        and Drugs finds that referring a new opioid drug or drugs to an

        section 505(j), the Commissioner shall not be required to refer 
        such drug or drugs to an advisory committee as required under 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Sunset.--Unless Congress reauthorizes paragraphs (1)

             TITLE IX--MENTAL HEALTH ON CAMPUS IMPROVEMENT

SEC. 901. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus 
Improvement Act''.

SEC. 902. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 2014 Association for University and College 
        Counseling Center Directors Survey found that the average ratio 
        of counselors to students on campus is nearly 1 to 1,833 and is 
        often far higher on large campuses. The International 
        Association of Counseling Services accreditation standards 
        recommends 1 counselor per 1,000 to 1,500 students.
            (2) College counselors report that 10 percent of enrolled 
        students sought counseling in 2014.
            (3) More than 90 percent of counseling directors believe 
        there is an increase in the number of students coming to campus 
        with severe psychological problems; today, 44 percent of the 
        students who visit campus counseling centers are dealing with 
        severe mental illness, up from 16 percent in 2000, and 24 
        percent are on psychiatric medication, up from 17 percent in 
        2000.
            (4) The majority of campus counseling directors report that 
        the demand for services and the severity of student needs are 
        growing without an increase in resources.
            (5) Many students who need help never receive it. Only 15 
        percent of college and university students who commit suicide 
        received campus counseling. Of students who seriously consider 
        suicide each year, only 52 percent of them seek any 
        professional help at all.
            (6) A 2015 American College Health Association survey of 
        more than 93,000 college and university students revealed that, 
        within the last 12 months, 57 percent of students report having 
        felt overwhelming anxiety, 35 percent felt so depressed it was 
        difficult to function, and 48 percent felt hopeless. However, 
        only 12 percent of students reported receiving professional 
        treatment for anxiety within the past 12 months, and 11 percent 
        reported receiving treatment for depression within the past 12 
        months.
            (7) The 2015 American College Health Association survey 
        also found that 9 percent of students have seriously considered 
        suicide in the past 12 months, a 20 percent increase compared 
        to 2012.
            (8) Research conducted between 1997 and 2009, and presented 
        at the 118th annual convention of the American Psychological 
        Association found that more students are grappling with 
        depression and anxiety disorders than were a decade ago. The 
        study found that, of students who sought college or university 
        counseling, 41 percent had moderate to severe depression in 
        2009, and that percentage was 34 percent in 1997.
            (9) A survey conducted by the student counseling center at 
        the University of Idaho in 2000 found that 77 percent of 
        students who responded reported that they were more likely to 
        stay in school because of counseling and that their school 
        performance would have declined without counseling.
            (10) Students with psychological issues often struggle 
        academically and are at risk for dropping out of school. 
        Counseling has been shown to address these issues while having 
        a positive impact on students remaining in school. A 6-year 
        longitudinal study found college and university students 
        receiving counseling to have a 11.4 percent higher retention 
        rate than the general college and university population.
            (11) A national survey of college and university students 
        living with mental health conditions, conducted by the National 
        Alliance on Mental Illness, found that 64 percent of students 
        who experience mental health problems in college or university 
        and withdraw from school do so because of their mental health 
        issues. The survey also found that 50 percent of that group 
        never accessed mental health services and supports.
