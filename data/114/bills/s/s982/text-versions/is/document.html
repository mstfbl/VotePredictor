    In this Act, the term ``water right'' means any surface or 
groundwater right filed, permitted, certified, confirmed, decreed, 
adjudicated, or otherwise recognized by a judicial proceeding or by the 
State in which the user acquires possession of the water or puts the 
water to beneficial use, including water rights for federally 
recognized Indian tribes.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF WATER RIGHTS.

    The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture 
shall not--
            (1) condition or withhold, in whole or in part, the 
        issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any permit, 
        approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or 
        other land use or occupancy agreement on--
                    (A) limitation or encumbrance of any water right, 
                or the transfer of any water right (including joint and 
                sole ownership), directly or indirectly to the United 
                States or any other designee; or
                    (B) any other impairment of any water right, in 
                whole or in part, granted or otherwise recognized under 
                State law, by Federal or State adjudication, decree, or 
                other judgment, or pursuant to any interstate water 
                compact;
            (2) require any water user (including any federally 
        recognized Indian tribe) to apply for or acquire a water right 
        in the name of the United States under State law as a condition 
        of the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any 
        permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-
        of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement;
            (3) assert jurisdiction over groundwater withdrawals or 
        impacts on groundwater resources, unless jurisdiction is 
        asserted, and any regulatory or policy actions taken pursuant 
        to such assertion are, consistent with, and impose no greater 
        restrictions or regulatory requirements than, applicable State 
        laws (including regulations) and policies governing the 
        protection and use of groundwater resources; or
            (4) infringe on the rights and obligations of a State in
