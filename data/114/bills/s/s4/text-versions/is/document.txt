            (1) In general.--Paragraph (10) of section 1847(b) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)) is amended--

                sentence and inserting the following new sentence: 
                ``With respect to bids to furnish such types of 
                products on or after January 1, 2019, the volume for 
                such types of products shall be determined by the 
                Secretary through the use of multiple sources of data, 
                including market based data measuring sales of diabetic 
                testing strip products described in section 1861(n) 
                that are not exclusively sold by, and marketed under 
                the name of, a single retailer that is not the 
                manufacturer of such products, from mail order, non-
                mail order, Medicare, and non-Medicare markets.''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraphs:
                    ``(C) Demonstration of ability to furnish types of 
                diabetic testing strip products.--With respect to bids 
                to furnish diabetic testing strip products on or after 
                January 1, 2019, under the program described in 
                subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall reject a bid 
                submitted by an entity if the entity does not attest to 
                the Secretary and demonstrate, through letters of 
                intent with manufacturers, wholesalers, or other 
                suppliers, or other evidence as the Secretary may 
                specify, that the entity has the ability to obtain an 
                inventory of the types and quantities of diabetic 
                testing strip products that will allow the entity to 
                furnish such products in a manner consistent with its 
                bid.
                    ``(D) Use of unlisted types in calculation of 
                percentage.--With respect to bids to furnish diabetic 
                testing strip products on or after January 1, 2019, in 
                determining under subparagraph (A) whether a bid 
                submitted by an entity under such subparagraph covers 
                50 percent (or such higher percentage as the Secretary 
                may specify) of all types of diabetic testing strip 
                products, the Secretary may not attribute a percentage 
                to types of diabetic testing strip products that the 
                Secretary does not identify by brand, model, and market 
                share volume.
                    ``(E) Adherence to demonstration.--
                            ``(i) In general.--In the case of an entity 
                        that is furnishing diabetic testing strip 
                        products on or after January 1, 2019, under a 
                        contract entered into under the competition 
                        conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
                        Secretary shall establish a process to monitor, 
                        on an ongoing basis, the extent to which such 
                        entity continues to cover the product types 
                        included in the entity's bid.
                            ``(ii) Termination.--If the Secretary 
                        determines that an entity described in clause 
                        (i) fails to maintain in inventory, or 
                        otherwise maintain ready access to through 
                        requirements contracts or otherwise, a type of 
                        product included in the entity's bid, the 
                        Secretary may terminate such contract unless 
                        the Secretary finds that the failure of the 
                        entity to maintain inventory of, or ready 
                        access to, the product is the result of the 
                        discontinuation of the product by the product 
                        manufacturer or a market-wide shortage of the 
                        product.''.

of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)), as amended by 
subsection (a)(1), is further amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraph (11) as paragraph (12); and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (10) the following new 
        paragraph:

        diabetic testing strips.--
                    ``(A) In general.--With respect to an entity that

                diabetic testing strip product selected by the 
                individual, including by--
                            ``(i) persuading, pressuring, or advising
