                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Federal Power Act to improve the siting of interstate 
       electric transmission facilities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SITING OF INTERSTATE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.

    Section 216 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824p) is amended to 
read as follows:

``SEC. 216. SITING OF INTERSTATE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.

    ``(a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that the 
national interstate transmission system should be guided by the goal of 
maximizing the net benefits of the electricity system, taking into 
consideration--
            ``(1) support for the development of new, cleaner power 
        generation capacity, including renewable energy generation 
        located distant from load centers;
            ``(2) opportunities for reduced emissions from regional 
        power production;
            ``(3) transmission needs driven by public policy 
        requirements established by State or Federal laws (including 
        regulations);
            ``(4) cost savings resulting from--
                    ``(A) reduced transmission congestion;
                    ``(B) enhanced opportunities for intraregional and 
                interregional electricity trades;
                    ``(C) reduced line losses;
                    ``(D) generation resource-sharing; and
                    ``(E) enhanced fuel diversity;
            ``(5) reliability benefits, including satisfying 
        reliability standards and guidelines for resource adequacy and 
        system security;
            ``(6) diversification of risk relating to events affecting 
        fuel supply or generating resources in a particular region;
            ``(7) the enhancement of competition in electricity markets 
        and mitigation of market power;
            ``(8) the ability to collocate facilities on existing 
        rights-of-way;
            ``(9) competing land use priorities, including land 
        protected under Federal or State law;
            ``(10) the requirements of section 217(b)(4); and
            ``(11) the contribution of demand side management 
        (including energy efficiency and demand response), energy 
        storage, distributed generation resources, and smart grid 
        investments.
    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) High-priority regional transmission project.--The 
        term `high-priority regional transmission project' means an 
        overhead, submarine, or underground transmission facility, 
        including conductors or cables, towers, manhole duct systems, 
        reactors, capacitors, circuit breakers, static VAR 
        compensators, static synchronous compensators, power 
        converters, transformers, synchronous condensers, braking 
        resistors, and any ancillary facilities and equipment necessary 
        for the proper operation of the facility, that is selected in a 
        regional transmission plan for the purposes of cost allocation 
        under Order Number 1000 of the Commission (or any successor 
        order), including an interregional project selected under that 
        plan.
            ``(2) Indian land.--The term `Indian land' means land--
                    ``(A) the title to which is held by the United 
                States in trust for an Indian tribe or individual 
                Indian; or
                    ``(B) that is held by an Indian tribe or individual 
                Indian subject to a restriction by the United States 
                against alienation or encumbrance.

        Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or

        village corporation (as defined in or established pursuant to 
        the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
        seq.), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs 
        and services provided by the United States to Indians because 
        of their status as Indians.
    ``(c) Siting.--
            ``(1) Purposes.--The purpose of this subsection is to 
        ensure that high-priority regional transmission projects are in 
        the public interest and advance the policy established under 
        subsection (a).
            ``(2) State review of project siting.--
                    ``(A) In general.--No developer of a high-priority 
                regional transmission project may seek a certificate 
                for construction under subsection (d) unless the 
                developer first seeks authorization to construct the 
                high-priority regional transmission project under 
                applicable State law concerning authorization and 
                routing of transmission facilities.

                        construct a high-priority regional transmission 
                        project because the developer does not serve
