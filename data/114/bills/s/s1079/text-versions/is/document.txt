SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
        death among men and women combined in the United States.
            (2) In 2015, more than 130,000 Americans will be diagnosed 
        with colorectal cancer, and nearly 50,000 Americans are 
        expected to die from it.
            (3) Approximately 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases and 
        70 percent of colorectal cancer deaths occur in those aged 65 
        and older.
            (4) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies allow for the 
        detection and removal of polyps before they progress to 
        colorectal cancer, as well as early detection of colorectal 
        cancer when treatment can be most effective.
            (5) According to a 2012 study published in the New England 
        Journal of Medicine, removing precancerous polyps through 
        colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer deaths 
        by 53 percent.
            (6) Although colorectal cancer is highly preventable with 
        appropriate screening, one in three adults between the ages of 
        50 and 75 years are not up to date with recommended colorectal 
        cancer screening.
            (7) Over 200 organizations have committed to eliminating 
        colorectal cancer as a major health problem in the United 
        States and are working toward a shared goal of screening 80 
        percent of eligible Americans by 2018.
            (8) Hepatitis C is a liver disease that causes inflammation 
        of the liver and results from infection with the Hepatitis C 
        virus. Chronic Hepatitis C infection can lead to serious health 
        problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. 
        It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the United 
        States.
            (9) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC), more than 75 percent of adults infected with 
        the Hepatitis C virus in the United States were born between 
        1945 and 1965.
            (10) The CDC estimates that up to 75 percent of individuals 
        with Hepatitis C do not know that they are infected.
            (11) The CDC and the United States Preventive Services Task 
        Force (USPSTF) recommend a one-time screening for Hepatitis C 
        for all individuals born between 1945 and 1965.
            (12) A recent study suggests that offering Hepatitis C 
        screening to patients in connection with screening 
        colonoscopies may be an effective means of increasing Hepatitis 
        C screening rates among individuals born between 1945 and 1965.

              COLONOSCOPY PROCEDURES FOR PROVIDERS PARTICIPATING IN

subsection (c)(5) attributable to such section for the year.
    (c) Determinations Relating to Expenditures.--For purposes of this 
section, before the beginning of each year (beginning with 2016) at the 
time conversion factors described in subsections (a) and (b) are
