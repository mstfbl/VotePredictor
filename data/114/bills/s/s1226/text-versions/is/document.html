Federal land for oil and gas exploration, development, and production 
under this Act.
    ``(b) Rights to Helium.--Any lease issued under this Act that 
authorizes exploration for, or development or production of, gas shall

the Secretary of the Interior.
    ``(c) Fee.--

        Secretary of the Interior shall collect a single $5,000 permit 
        processing fee per application from each applicant at the time 
        the final decision is made whether to issue a permit to drill 
        under a helium lease issued under this section.
            ``(2) No fee for resubmitted applications.--The Secretary 
        of the Interior shall not collect the fee described in

                in which the fees are collected; and
                    ``(B) used to process protests, leases, and permits 
                under this Act, subject to appropriations.''.

lease in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary.''.

environmental impact statement (referred to in this section as the

U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for an agencywide helium exploration and 
development program under the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et 
seq.).

takes into consideration the Helium Act (50 U.S.C. 167 et seq.).
