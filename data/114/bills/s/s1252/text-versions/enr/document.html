                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

           Begun and held at the City of Washington on Monday,
           the fourth day of January, two thousand and sixteen


                                 An Act


 
   To authorize a comprehensive strategic approach for United States 
foreign assistance to developing countries to reduce global poverty and 
    hunger, achieve food and nutrition security, promote inclusive, 
   sustainable, agricultural-led economic growth, improve nutritional 
  outcomes, especially for women and children, build resilience among 
             vulnerable populations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of 2016''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
    United Nations (referred to in this section as the ``FAO''), 
    805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger. Hunger and 
    malnutrition rob people of health and productive lives and stunt 
    the mental and physical development of future generations.
        (2) According to the January 2014 ``Worldwide Threat Assessment 
    of the US Intelligence Community''--
            (A) the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be a destabilizing 
        factor in countries important to US national security that do 
        not have the financial or technical abilities to solve their 
        internal food security problems''; and
            (B) ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity in weakly governed 
        countries might also provide opportunities for insurgent groups 
        to capitalize on poor conditions, exploit international food 
        aid, and discredit governments for their inability to address 
        basic needs''.
        (3) A comprehensive approach to sustainable food and nutrition 
    security should not only respond to emergency food shortages, but 
    should also address malnutrition, resilience to food and nutrition 
    insecurity, building the capacity of poor, rural populations to 
    improve their agricultural productivity and incomes, removing 
    institutional impediments to agricultural development, value chain 
    access and efficiency, including processing and storage, enhancing 
    agribusiness development, access to markets and activities that 
    address the specific needs and barriers facing women and small-
    scale producers, education, and collaborative research.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY OBJECTIVES; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    (a) Statement of Policy Objectives.--It is in the national interest 
of the United States to promote global food security, resilience, and 
nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans, 
which is reinforced through programs, activities, and initiatives 
that--
        (1) place food insecure countries on a path toward self-
    sufficiency and economic freedom through the coordination of United 
    States foreign assistance programs;
        (2) accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth that 
    reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, particularly 
    among women and children;
        (3) increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of 
    small-scale producers, especially women, by working across 
    agricultural value chains, enhancing local capacity to manage 
    agricultural resources effectively and expanding producer access to 
    local and international markets;
        (4) build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable 
    populations and households while reducing reliance upon emergency 
    food assistance;
        (5) create an enabling environment for agricultural growth and 
    investment, including through the promotion of secure and 
    transparent property rights;
        (6) improve the nutritional status of women and children, with 
    a focus on reducing child stunting, including through the promotion 
    of highly nutritious foods, diet diversification, and nutritional 
    behaviors that improve maternal and child health;
        (7) demonstrably meet, align with and leverage broader United 
    States strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, 
    national security, science and technology, agriculture research and 
    extension, maternal and child health, nutrition, and water, 
    sanitation, and hygiene;
        (8) continue to strengthen partnerships between United States-
    based universities, including land-grant colleges, and universities 
    and institutions in target countries and communities that build 
    agricultural capacity; and
        (9) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer dollars 
    to further these objectives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
President, in providing assistance to implement the Global Food 
Security Strategy, should--
        (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the 
    efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to implement 
    the Global Food Security Strategy;
        (2) seek to fully utilize the unique capabilities of each 
    relevant Federal department and agency while collaborating with and 
    leveraging the contributions of other key stakeholders; and
        (3) utilize open and streamlined solicitations to allow for the 
    participation of a wide range of implementing partners through the 
    most appropriate procurement mechanisms, which may include grants, 
    contracts, cooperative agreements, and other instruments as 
    necessary and appropriate.

    murder, forced displacement, aerial bombardment, ethnic and 
    religious persecution, torture, kidnapping, rape and sexual 
    enslavement, has triggered one of the most profound humanitarian 
    crises of this century and poses a direct threat to regional 
    security and the national security interests of the United States;
        (2) it is in the national security interests of the United 
    States to respond to the needs of displaced Syrian persons and the 
    communities hosting such persons, including with food assistance; 
    and
        (3) after four years of conflict in Syria and the onset of 
    other major humanitarian emergencies where, like Syria, the 
    provision of certain United States humanitarian assistance has been 
    particularly challenging, including the 2013 super-typhoon in the 
    Philippines, the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, the 2015 
    earthquake in Nepal, ongoing humanitarian disasters in Yemen and 
    South Sudan, and the threat of a major El Nino event in 2016, 
    United States international disaster assistance has become severely 
    stressed.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States, in coordination with other donors, regional governments, 
international organizations, and international financial institutions, 
to fully leverage, enhance, and expand the impact and reach of 
available United States humanitarian resources, including for food 
assistance, to mitigate the effects of manmade and natural disasters by 
utilizing innovative new approaches to delivering aid that support 
affected persons and the communities hosting them, build resilience and 
early recovery, and reduce opportunities for waste, fraud, and abuse.
    (c) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--
        (1) Section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
    U.S.C. 2292) is amended--
