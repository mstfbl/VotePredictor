                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize a comprehensive strategic approach for United States 
foreign assistance to developing countries to reduce global poverty and 
    hunger, achieve food and nutrition security, promote inclusive, 
  sustainable, agricultural-led economic growth, improve nutritional 
  outcomes, especially for women and children, build resilience among 
            vulnerable populations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of 
2015''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress makes the following findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) According to the Food and Agriculture 
        Organization of the United Nations (referred to in this section 
        as the ``FAO''), 805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from 
        chronic hunger. Hunger and malnutrition rob people of health 
        and productive lives and stunt the mental and physical 
        development of future generations.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) According to the January 2014 ``Worldwide 
        Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community''--
        </DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be 
                a destabilizing factor in countries important to US 
                national security that do not have the financial or 
                technical abilities to solve their internal food 
                security problems''; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity in 
                weakly governed countries might also provide 
                opportunities for insurgent groups to capitalize on 
                poor conditions, exploit international food aid, and 
                discredit governments for their inability to address 
                basic needs''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Decades of research have shown that there are 
        multiple underlying causes of food insecurity and poor 
        nutrition, including--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) the lack of availability of, access 
                to, and consumption of nutritious food;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) limited investments to improve 
                agricultural productivity;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) social and gender 
                inequality;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (D) insufficient value chains and market 
                development for farmers, including small-scale 
                producers, which lead to post-harvest loss; 
                and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (E) weak institutions in government and 
                civil society.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Agriculture, which comprises large portions of 
        the total labor force in many developing countries, is an 
        essential component of inclusive economic growth. According to 
        the World Bank's 2008 World Development Report, growth in the 
        agricultural sector has been twice as effective in reducing 
        poverty as growth in other sectors.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Women, who are often heads of households and 
        small farmers, are especially vulnerable to food insecurity. 
        Women frequently face stricter constraints than men in 
        accessing markets and resources. In its 2010-2011 report, the 
        FAO estimated that if women farmers had the same access to 
        inputs as men, they could increase their farm yields by 20 to 
        30 percent. According to the FAO, this ``could raise total 
        agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 
        percent''.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) According to UNICEF--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) more than 161,000,000 children younger 
                than 5 years of age suffer from chronic malnutrition 
                (also referred to as stunting); and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) 1 in 3 women in the developing world 
                are anemic, which leads to severe health and 
                developmental consequences.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) According to the United Nations World Food 
        Programme, poor nutrition causes 45 percent of deaths in 
        children younger than 5 years of age.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) Malnutrition can--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) undermine future earning potential by 
                up to 20 percent; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) inhibit economic growth by up to 3 
                percent of gross domestic product.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) According to The Cost of Hunger in Africa 
        Study by the African Union Commission--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) the economic costs associated with 
                child undernutrition are substantial, ranging from 2 
                percent to 16 percent of the gross national product in 
                several African nations; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) adults who suffer from stunting as 
                children are less productive than nonstunted workers 
                and are less able to contribute to the 
                economy.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) According to Save the Children's 2013 Food 
        for Thought report, if the current malnutrition rates continue, 
        global output could be reduced by an estimated $125,000,000,000 
        by 2030, as the young children of today reach working 
        age.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) A comprehensive approach to sustainable food 
        and nutrition security should not only respond to emergency 
        food shortages, but should also address malnutrition, 
        resilience to food and nutrition insecurity, building the 
        capacity of poor, rural populations to improve their 
        agricultural productivity, and incomes, removing institutional 
        impediments to agricultural development, value chain access and 
        efficiency, including processing and storage, enhancing 
        agribusiness development, access to markets and activities that 
        address the specific needs and barriers facing women and small-
        scale producers, education, and collaborative 
        research.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) An effective, sustainable approach to 
        combating food insecurity requires consultation with, and 
        participation from, multiple stakeholders, including 
        government, the private sector, international organizations, 
        international and local nongovernmental stakeholders, 
        grassroots and civil society organizations, faith-based 
        organizations, and higher education research 
        institutions.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (13) Nongovernmental organizations, faith-based 
        organizations, community-based organizations, private voluntary 
        organizations, academic institutions, and cooperatives can 
        increase the effectiveness of public investments by building 
        local capacity, strengthening food and nutrition security and 
        resilience, and leveraging additional resources.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (14) The United States has provided consistent 
        global leadership in addressing food security and investing in 
        agricultural development and humanitarian assistance. In 2010, 
        the United States Government launched Feed the Future (referred 
        to in this paragraph as ``FTF''), an initiative designed to 
        expand and better coordinate the United States investments in 
        improving global food security. FTF is a whole-of-government 
        approach that works across agricultural value chains and 
        focuses on the dual objectives of improving farmer 
        productivity, income, and livelihoods in developing countries 
        and improving the nutrition of women and children.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (15) The United States Government spearheaded the 
        creation of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program 
        (referred to in this paragraph as the ``GAFSP''), which 
        mobilizes contributions from a wide range of international 
        donors to support the goals of FTF. As of 2014, the GAFSP had 
        received pledges totaling $1,300,000,000 from 10 donors and 
        reached an estimated 12,000,000 direct beneficiaries in 25 
        countries.</DELETED>

(division K of Public Law 113-76; 128 Stat. 554).</DELETED>

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
        the United Nations (referred to in this section as the 
        ``FAO''), 805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from chronic 
        hunger. Hunger and malnutrition rob people of health and 
        productive lives and stunt the mental and physical development 
        of future generations.
            (2) According to the January 2014 ``Worldwide Threat 
        Assessment of the US Intelligence Community''--
                    (A) the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be a 
                destabilizing factor in countries important to US 
                national security that do not have the financial or 
                technical abilities to solve their internal food 
                security problems''; and
                    (B) ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity in weakly 
                governed countries might also provide opportunities for 
                insurgent groups to capitalize on poor conditions, 
                exploit international food aid, and discredit 
                governments for their inability to address basic 
                needs''.
            (3) A comprehensive approach to sustainable food and 
        nutrition security should not only respond to emergency food 
        shortages, but should also address malnutrition, resilience to 
        food and nutrition insecurity, building the capacity of poor, 
        rural populations to improve their agricultural productivity 
        and incomes, removing institutional impediments to agricultural 
        development, value chain access and efficiency, including 
        processing and storage, enhancing agribusiness development, 
        access to markets and activities that address the specific 
        needs and barriers facing women and small-scale producers, 
        education, and collaborative research.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY OBJECTIVES; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Statement of Policy Objectives.--It is in the national security 
interest of the United States to promote global food security, 
resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security 
investment plans, which is reinforced through programs, activities, and 
initiatives that--
            (1) place food insecure countries on a path toward self-
        sufficiency and economic freedom through the coordination of 
        United States foreign assistance programs;
            (2) accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth 
        that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, 
        particularly among women and children;
            (3) increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of 
        small-scale producers, especially women, by working across 
        agricultural value chains, enhancing local capacity to manage 
        agricultural resources effectively and expanding producer 
        access to local and international markets;
            (4) build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable 
        populations and households while reducing reliance upon 
        emergency food assistance;
            (5) create an enabling environment for agricultural growth 
        and investment, including through the promotion of secure and 
        transparent property rights;
            (6) improve the nutritional status of women and children, 
        with a focus on reducing child stunting, including through the 
        promotion of highly nutritious foods, diet diversification, and 
        nutritional behaviors that improve maternal and child health;
            (7) align with and leverage broader United States 
        strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, science 
        and technology, agriculture research and extension, maternal 
        and child health, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and 
        hygiene;
            (8) continue to strengthen partnerships between United 
        States-based universities, including land-grant colleges, and 
        universities and institutions in target countries and 
        communities that build agricultural capacity; and
            (9) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer 
        dollars to further these objectives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
President, in providing assistance to implement the Global Food 
Security Strategy, should--
            (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the 
        efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to 
        implement the Global Food Security Strategy;
            (2) seek to fully utilize the unique capabilities of each 
        relevant Federal department and agency while collaborating with 
        and leveraging the contributions of other key stakeholders; and
            (3) utilize open and streamlined solicitations to allow for 
        the participation of a wide range of implementing partners 
        through the most appropriate procurement mechanisms, which may 
        include grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other 
        instruments as necessary and appropriate.

        needed to sustain their long-term economic prosperity;
            (6) support improvement of the nutritional status of women

        nutrition-sensitive programs, including related water, 
        sanitation, and hygiene programs;
            (7) facilitate communication and collaboration, as 
        appropriate, among local stakeholders in support of a multi-

        and communities meet the progress benchmarks identified 
        pursuant to section 8(b)(4).

SEC. 7. EMERGENCY FOOD SECURITY PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the crisis in Syria, which is characterized by acts of 
        terrorism and atrocities directed against civilians, including 
        mass murder, forced displacement, aerial bombardment, ethnic 
        and religious persecution, torture, kidnapping, rape and sexual 
        enslavement, has triggered one of the most profound 
        humanitarian crises of this century and poses a direct threat 
        to regional security and the national security interests of the 
        United States;
            (2) it is in the national security interests of the United 
        States to respond to the needs of displaced Syrian persons and 
        the communities hosting such persons, including with food 
        assistance; and
            (3) after four years of conflict in Syria and the onset of 
        other major humanitarian emergencies where, like Syria, the 
        provision of certain United States humanitarian assistance has 
        been particularly challenging, including the 2013 super-typhoon 
        in the Philippines, the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa, 
        the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, ongoing humanitarian disasters in 
        Yemen and South Sudan, and the threat of a major El Nino event 
        in 2016, United States international disaster assistance has 
        become severely stressed.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States, in coordination with other donors, regional governments, 
international organizations, and international financial institutions, 
to fully leverage, enhance, and expand the impact and reach of 
available United States humanitarian resources, including for food 
assistance, to mitigate the effects of manmade and natural disasters by 
utilizing innovative new approaches to delivering aid that support 
affected persons and the communities hosting them, build resilience and 
early recovery, and reduce opportunities for waste, fraud, and abuse.
    (c) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--
            (1) Section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
        U.S.C. 2292) is amended--

        needs arising from manmade and natural disasters.
            ``(2) Designation.--Funds made available under this 
        subsection shall be known as the `International Disaster

        States that the funds made available to carry out section 491 
        are intended to provide the President with the greatest 
        possible flexibility to address disaster-related needs as they 
        arise and to prepare for and reduce the impact of natural and 
        man-made disasters.
            ``(2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        any amendments to applicable legal provisions contained in this
