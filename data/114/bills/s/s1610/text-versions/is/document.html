                that no program, project, or other activity specified

            (7) Racial profiling.--The term ``racial profiling'' means 
        the practice of a law enforcement agent or agency relying, to 
        any degree, on actual or perceived race, ethnicity, national 
        origin, religion, gender, gender identity, or sexual 
        orientation in selecting which individual to subject to routine 
        or spontaneous investigatory activities or in deciding upon the 
        scope and substance of law enforcement activity following the 
        initial investigatory procedure, except when there is 
        trustworthy information, relevant to the locality and 
        timeframe, that links a person with a particular characteristic 
        described in this paragraph to an identified criminal incident 
        or scheme.
            (8) Routine or spontaneous investigatory activities.--The

                of individuals using any form of public or private 
                transportation, including motorists and pedestrians.
                    (F) Data collection and analysis, assessments, and 
                predicated investigations.
                    (G) Inspections and interviews of entrants into the 
                United States that are more extensive than those 
                customarily carried out.
                    (H) Immigration-related workplace investigations.

                    (A) are immaterial to the investigation;

                personal information; or
                    (C) would place a severe burden on the resources of 
                the law enforcement agency given its size.
            (10) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50

      TITLE II--VOTING RIGHTS REFORM AND CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION

                   Subtitle A--Democracy Restoration

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of 
        citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates 
        individuals with criminal convictions into free society, 
        helping to enhance public safety.
            (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants 
        Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an 
        authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the United States 
        Supreme Court.
            (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal 
        protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the 
        United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote 
        may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any 
        State on account of race, color, gender, or previous condition 
        of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th 
        Amendments to the Constitution empower Congress to enact 
        measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. The 
        8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no excessive 
        bail to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
        unusual punishments inflicted.
            (4) There are 3 areas where discrepancies in State laws 
        regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal 
        elections--
                    (A) the lack of a uniform standard for voting in 
                Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity and 
                unequal participation in Federal elections based solely 
                on where a person lives;
                    (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights 
                after a criminal conviction vary throughout the country 
                and persons in some States can easily regain their 
                voting rights while in other States persons effectively 
                lose their right to vote permanently; and
                    (C) State disenfranchisement laws 
                disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities.
            (5) Two States do not disenfranchise individuals with 
        criminal convictions at all (Maine and Vermont), but 48 States 
        and the District of Columbia have laws that deny convicted 
        individuals the right to vote while they are in prison.
            (6) In some States disenfranchisement results from varying 
        State laws that restrict voting while individuals are under the 
        supervision of the criminal justice system or after they have 
        completed a criminal sentence. In 35 States, convicted 
        individuals may not vote while they are on parole and 31 of 
        those States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation as 
        well. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime 
        disenfranchisement.
            (7) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals 
        convicted of certain misdemeanors.
            (8) An estimated 5,850,000 citizens of the United States, 
        or about 1 in 40 adults in the United States, currently cannot 
        vote as a result of a felony conviction. Of the 5,850,000 
        citizens barred from voting, only 25 percent are in prison. By 
        contrast, 75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their 
        communities while on probation or parole or after having 
        completed their sentences. Approximately 2,600,000 citizens who 
        have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due to 
        restrictive State laws. In 6 States--Alabama, Florida, 
        Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia--more than 7 
        percent of the total population is disenfranchised.
            (9) In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-
        sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in 
        practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and 
        potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals 
        must either obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an 
        action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense 
        and State. Individuals convicted of a Federal offense often 
        have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.
            (10) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately 
        impact racial and ethnic minorities. Eight percent of the 
        African-American population, or 2,000,000 African-Americans, 
        are disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 
        approximately 1 in 3 of the next generation of African-American 
        men will be disenfranchised at some point during their 
        lifetime. Currently, 1 of every 13 African-Americans are 
        rendered unable to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, 
        which is a rate 4 times greater than non African-Americans. 7.7 
        percent of African-Americans are disenfranchised whereas only 
        1.8 percent of non African-Americans are. In 3 States--Florida 
        (23 percent), Kentucky (22 percent), and Virginia (20 
        percent)--more than 1 in 5 African-Americans are unable to vote 
        because of prior convictions.
            (11) Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised 
        based upon their disproportionate representation in the 
        criminal justice system. If current incarceration trends hold, 
        17 percent of Latino men will be incarcerated during their 
        lifetimes, in contrast to less than 6 percent of non-Latino 
        White men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, Latinos 
        generally have disproportionately higher rates of 
        disenfranchisement compared to their presence in the voting age 
        population. In 6 out of 10 States studied in 2003, Latinos 
        constitute more than 10 percent of the total number of persons 
        disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States (California, 
        37 percent; New York, 34 percent; Texas, 30 percent; and 
        Arizona, 27 percent), Latinos were disenfranchised by a rate of 
        more than 25 percent.
            (12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a 
        criminal offense and who are living and working in the 
        community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their 
        rehabilitation and reintegration into society.
            (13) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral 
        participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting 
        among family and community members of disenfranchised persons. 
        Future electoral participation by the children of 
        disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well.
            (14) The United States is the only Western democracy that 
        permits the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals 
        with felony convictions.

SEC. 203. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.
