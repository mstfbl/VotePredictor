SEC. 2. CREDITS FOR PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE CHEMICALS AND INVESTMENTS 
              IN RENEWABLE CHEMICAL PRODUCTION FACILITIES.

            (1) In general.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of 
        chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by 
        adding at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 45S. CREDIT FOR PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE CHEMICALS.

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of section 38, the production 
credit for renewable chemicals for any taxable year is an amount 
(determined separately for each renewable chemical produced by the 
taxpayer) equal to $0.15 per pound of biobased content of each 
renewable chemical produced by the taxpayer during the taxable year.
    ``(b) Limitation.--The amount of the credit determined under 
subsection (a) with respect to a renewable chemical produced by the 
taxpayer during any taxable year shall not exceed the credit amount 
allocated for purposes of this section by the Secretary to the taxpayer 
with respect to such chemical for such taxable year under section 
48E(e).
    ``(c) Biobased Content.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`biobased content' means, with respect to any renewable chemical, the 
biobased content of the total mass of organic carbon in such chemical 
(expressed as a percentage), determined by testing representative 
samples using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) 
D6866.
    ``(d) Renewable Chemical.--For purposes of this section--
