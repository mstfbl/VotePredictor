     To provide for the establishment of a Clean Energy Technology 
   Manufacturing and Export Assistance Fund to assist United States 
    businesses with exporting clean energy technology products and 
                               services.

SEC. 2. CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING AND EXPORT ASSISTANCE 
              FUND.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Clean energy technology.--The term ``clean energy 
        technology'' means a technology related to the production, use, 
        transmission, storage, control, or conservation of energy that 
        will contribute to a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse 
        gas concentrations through reduction, avoidance, or 
        sequestration of energy-related emissions and--
                    (A) reduce the need for additional energy supplies 
                by using existing energy supplies with greater 
                efficiency or by transmitting, distributing, or 
                transporting energy with greater effectiveness through 
                the infrastructure of the United States; or
                    (B) diversify the sources of energy supply of the 
                United States to strengthen energy security and to 
                increase supplies with a favorable balance of 
                environmental effects if the entire technology system 
                is considered.
            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Commerce.
    (b) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a Clean

                export strategy.
            (3) Purpose.--The purpose of the Fund is to ensure that 
        United States clean energy technology firms, including clean 
        energy technology parts suppliers and engineering and design 
        firms, have the information and assistance they need to be 
        competitive and create clean energy technology sector jobs in 
        the United States.
    (c) Assistance.--The Secretary, consistent with the National Export 
Initiative (established by Executive Order 13534 (75 Fed. Reg. 
12,433)), shall use amounts in the Fund to provide information, tools,
