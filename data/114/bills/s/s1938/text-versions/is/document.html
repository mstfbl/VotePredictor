        program meets any instructional curriculum licensure or 
        certification requirements of such State.
            ``(15) In the case of a program designed to prepare an 
        individual for employment pursuant to standards developed by a 
        board or agency of a State in an occupation that requires 
        approval or licensure, the program is approved or licensed by 
        such board or agency of the State.''.
    (b) Exceptions.--Such section is further amended by adding at the 
end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (14) or

        paragraph at any time during the two-year period preceding the 
        date of the waiver.
            ``(3) The waiver furthers the purposes of the educational 
        assistance programs administered by the Secretary or would 
        further the education interests of individuals eligible for 
        assistance under such programs.
            ``(4) The educational institution does not provide any 
        commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or

        to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or 
        admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award 
        of student financial assistance, except for the recruitment of 
        foreign students residing in foreign countries who are not 
        eligible to receive Federal student assistance.''.

institution providing the course of education publicly discloses any 
conditions or additional requirements, including training, experience, 
or exams, required to obtain the license, certification, or approval 
for which the course of education is designed to provide 
preparation.''.
    (e) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3672(b)(2)(A)(i) of such title
