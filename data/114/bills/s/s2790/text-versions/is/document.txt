    (b) Termination Requests or Orders Must Be Material.--
            (1) In general.--The appropriate Federal banking agency may 
        not formally or informally request or order a depository 
        institution to terminate a specific customer account or group 
        of customer accounts or to otherwise restrict or discourage a 
        depository institution from entering into or maintaining a 
        banking relationship with a specific customer or group of 
        customers unless--
                    (A) the agency has a material reason for the 
                request or order; and
                    (B) that reason is not based solely on reputation 
                risk to the depository institution.
            (2) Treatment of national security threats.--The 
        appropriate Federal banking agency shall satisfy the 
        requirement under paragraph (1) if the agency believes a 
        specific customer or group of customers is, or is acting as a 
        conduit for, an entity which--
                    (A) poses a threat to national security;
                    (B) is involved in terrorist financing;
                    (C) is an agency of the Government of Iran, North 
                Korea, Syria, or any country listed from time to time 
                on the state sponsor of terrorism list;
                    (D) is located in, or is subject to the 
                jurisdiction of, any country described in subparagraph 
                (C); or
                    (E) does business with any entity described in 
                subparagraph (C) or (D), unless the appropriate Federal 
                banking agency determines that the customer or group of 
                customers has used due diligence to avoid doing 
                business with any entity described in subparagraph (C) 
                or (D).
    (c) Notice Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--If the appropriate Federal banking agency 
        formally or informally requests or orders a depository 
        institution to terminate a specific customer account or a group 
        of customer accounts, the agency shall--
                    (A) provide the request or order to the institution 
                in writing; and
                    (B) include with the request or order a written 
                justification for why the termination is necessary, 
                including any specific laws or regulations, if any, the 
                agency believes that the customer or group of customers 
                are violating.
            (2) Justification requirement.--A written justification 
        under paragraph (1)(B) may not be based solely on the 
        reputation risk to the depository institution.
    (d) Customer Notice.--
            (1) Notice required.--Except as provided under paragraph 
        (2), if the appropriate Federal banking agency orders a 
        depository institution to terminate a specific customer account 
        or a group of customer accounts, the depository institution 
        shall inform the customer or customers of the justification for 
        the termination of the account or accounts under subsection 
        (c)(1)(B).
            (2) Notice prohibited in cases of national security.--If 
        the appropriate Federal banking agency requests or orders a 
        depository institution to terminate a specific customer account 
        or a group of customer accounts based on a belief that the 
        customer or customers pose a threat to national security, or 
        are otherwise described in subsection (b)(2), neither the 
        depository institution nor the appropriate Federal banking 
        agency may inform the customer or customers of the 
        justification for the termination of the account or accounts.
    (e) Reporting Requirement.--Each appropriate Federal banking agency 
shall issue an annual report to Congress stating--
            (1) the aggregate number of specific customer accounts that 
        the agency requested or ordered a depository institution to 
        terminate during the 1-year period preceding the issuance of 
        the report;
            (2) the legal authority on which the agency relied in 
        making the requests and orders described in paragraph (1); and
            (3) the frequency with which the agency relied on each 
        authority described in paragraph (2).

                of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, or 
                other records which the Attorney General deems relevant 
                or material to the inquiry, if the Attorney General--

                        of competent jurisdiction for such actions and 
                        offers specific and articulable facts showing 
                        that there are reasonable grounds to believe

                        relevant and material for conducting an 
                        investigation under this section; or
                            ``(ii) either personally or through 
                        delegation no lower than the Deputy Attorney 
                        General, issues and signs a subpoena for such 
                        actions and such subpoena is supported by 
                        specific and articulable facts showing that 
                        there are reasonable grounds to believe that 
                        the information or testimony sought is relevant 
                        for conducting an investigation under this 
                        section.''.
