SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue

        compliance burdens on businesses, insurance carriers, and 
        individuals.
            (2) Such collaboration should strike an appropriate balance 
        between sufficient reporting to enforce the law and protecting 
        the privacy of individuals.

                        requirements to qualify for one of the 
                        affordability safe harbors promulgated by the 
                        Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of 
                        section 4980H of such Code; and

        Service can securely and confidentially access the information 
        described in paragraph (1) as necessary to carry out their 
        respective missions, and to provide to the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services additional information relating to 
        eligibility determinations for advance payment of the premium 
        tax credits under section 36B of such Code and the cost-sharing

        Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071);
            (3) a process to allow Exchanges to follow up with 
        employers in order to obtain additional reasonably necessary

        employee to receive notification of any problem in verifying 
        such eligibility; and
            (4) a process to allow employers using the system to 
        provide timely updates to the Federal Marketplace Data Services

                        for a plan year, or whose dependents enroll in 
                        such a plan, at the time of such enrollment; or

                section to those employees of the employer whose names 
                have been provided to the employer by an Exchange under 
                section 1311(d)(4)(J)(i) of the Patient Protection and 
                Affordable Care Act regarding enrollment of the 
                employee or a dependent in a qualified health plan (as 
                defined in section 1301 of such Act) through the 
                Exchange; and
                    ``(B) furnishes a copy of such statement with

        insurance issuer or the employer is unable to collect or 
        maintain information on the TINs of such individuals (other 
        than for purposes of this section), the Secretary may allow the 
        individual's full name and date of birth to be substituted for 
        the name and TIN. In the event the Secretary allows the use of 
        the individual's full name and date of birth in lieu of the 
        TIN, the Social Security Administration shall assist the 
        Internal Revenue Service in providing data matches to determine 
        the TIN associated with the name and date of birth provided by 
        the Internal Revenue Service with respect to such 
        individual.''.

after the date of the enactment of this Act.

statement under this section in electronic form if such individual has 
affirmatively consented at any prior time, to the person who is the 
employer of the individual during the calendar year to which the

        required to make such statement (such as the provider of the 
        individual's health coverage), to receive in electronic form 
        any private health information (such as electronic health 
        records), unless the individual revokes such consent in 
        writing.''.
