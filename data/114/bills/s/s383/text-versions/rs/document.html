    &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE I--RECOGNITION OF TRUST RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 101. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress, after careful review of the historical and 
special legal relationship of the United States with, and resulting 
responsibilities to, Indians, finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the relationship of Indian tribes to the 
        United States is founded in part on the settled doctrine of the 
        law of nations that when a stronger sovereign assumes authority 
        over a weaker sovereign, the stronger nation assumes a duty of 
        protection for the weaker nation, which does not surrender the 
        right to self-government;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the fiduciary responsibilities of the United 
        States to Indians also are founded in part on specific 
        commitments made through written treaties and agreements 
        securing peace, in exchange for which Indians have surrendered 
        claims to vast tracts of land, which provided legal 
        consideration for permanent, ongoing performance of Federal 
        trust duties; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the foregoing historic Federal-tribal 
        relations and understandings have benefitted the people of the 
        United States as a whole for centuries and established enduring 
        and enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor 
        has been committed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 102. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Pursuant to the constitutionally vested authority of 
Congress over Indian affairs, Congress reaffirms that the fiduciary 
responsibilities of the United States to Indian tribes include a duty 
to promote tribal self-determination regarding governmental authority 
and economic development.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

    &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE II--INDIAN TRUST ASSET MANAGEMENT DEMONSTRATION 
                           PROJECT&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--At the discretion of the 
                Indian tribe, an Indian trust asset management plan may

                activities authorized to be included in the plan under 
                subparagraph (A).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        activity funded by a Federal agency, the Indian tribe shall

        surface leasing transaction or timber resource transaction

                the Indian tribe, documentation of the payments that is 
                sufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge the 
                trust responsibility of the United States under

                and at the discretion of the Secretary, enforce the 
                provisions of, or cancel, any lease executed by the

                submit to the Secretary a petition, at such time and in 
                such form as the Secretary determines to be 
                appropriate, to review the compliance of an applicable 
                Indian tribe with any tribal regulations approved by

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 205. EFFECT OF TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Liability.--Subject to subsection (b), nothing in this 
title or a trust asset management plan approved under section 204 shall

Project for any loss resulting from the management of an Indian trust 
asset under an Indian trust asset management plan.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Deviation From Standard Practices.--The United States 
shall not be liable to any party (including any Indian tribe) for any 
term of, or any loss resulting from the terms of, an Indian trust asset 
management plan that provides for management of a trust asset at a 
less-stringent standard than the Secretary would otherwise require or 
adhere to in absence of an Indian trust asset management 
plan.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Effect on Other Laws.--Except with respect to any 
regulation superseded by a trust asset management plan approved under 
section 204(b), or any tribal regulation included or incorporated by 
reference in such a plan under section 204(e), nothing in this title 
amends or otherwise affects the application of any treaty, statute, 
regulation, Executive order, or court decision that is applicable to 
Indian trust assets or the management or administration of Indian trust 
assets.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Trust Responsibility.--Nothing in this title enhances, 
diminishes, or otherwise affects the trust responsibility of the United 
States to Indian tribes or individual Indians.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

              TITLE I--RECOGNITION OF TRUST RESPONSIBILITY

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) there exists a unique relationship between the 
        Government of the United States and the governments of Indian 
        tribes;
            (2) there exists a unique Federal responsibility to 
        Indians;
            (3) through treaties, statutes, and historical relations 
        with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique 
        trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and 
        Indians;
            (4) the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to 
        Indians also are founded in part on specific commitments made 
        through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in 
        exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast 
        tracts of land, which provided legal consideration for 
        permanent, ongoing performance of Federal trust duties; and
            (5) the foregoing historic Federal-tribal relations and 
        understandings have benefitted the people of the United States 
        as a whole for centuries and have established enduring and 
        enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has 
        been committed.

SEC. 102. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.

    Pursuant to the constitutionally vested authority of Congress over 
Indian affairs, Congress reaffirms that the fiduciary responsibilities 
of the United States to Indian tribes include a duty to promote tribal 
self-determination regarding governmental authority and economic 
development.

            (2) Selection of specific transactions and activities.--At 
        the discretion of the Indian tribe, the Indian tribe may

                approval responsibilities, provide to the applicable 
                Indian tribe--
                            (i) a hearing on the record; and

be liable to any party (including any Indian tribe) for any term of, or

standard than the Secretary would otherwise require or adhere to in 
absence of an Indian trust asset management plan.

        the management or administration of Indian trust assets.
            (2) Indian self-determination act.--Nothing in this title

        agreement under the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) (including regulations).
    (e) Separate Approval.--An Indian tribe may submit to the Secretary
