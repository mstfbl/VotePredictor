SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The population of the United States is estimated to age 
        rapidly, with the number of people over the age of 65 set to 
        double to more than 72,000,000, or 1 in 5 Americans, over the 
        next two decades.
            (2) Americans today are living longer and healthier lives 
        than ever before in the history of the United States yet are 
        also facing increased incidence of multiple serious conditions 
        as aging progresses.
            (3) Americans with advanced illness face a complicated and 
        fragmented system of care delivery that puts them at risk for 
        repeat hospitalizations, adverse drug reactions, and 
        conflicting medical advice that may be overwhelming to 
        individuals and families.
            (4) The progression of advanced illness leads to the need 
        for increasingly intensive decision support, health care 
        services, and support from family caregivers.
            (5) The complexity of care needed by individuals with 
        advanced illness may result in uncoordinated care, adverse 
        health outcomes, frustration, wasted time, and undue emotional 
        burdens on individuals and their family caregivers.
            (6) Numerous private sector leaders, including hospitals, 
        health systems, home health agencies, hospice programs, long-
        term care providers, employers, and other entities, have put in 
        place innovative solutions to provide more comprehensive and 
        coordinated care for Americans living with advanced illness.
            (7) Hospice programs, as one of the longest standing 
        Medicare care coordination benefits that offer a comprehensive 
        set of services via an interdisciplinary team working to 
        provide person- and family-centered care to the frailest and 
        most vulnerable individuals in our communities, can serve as a 
        model for advanced illness care delivery.
            (8) Palliative care programs that serve patients beginning 
        at diagnosis with advanced illness and provide care designed to 
        reduce the symptom burden of illness can serve as a model for 
        interdisciplinary team care planning based on the individual's 
        goals of care.
            (9) The Government of the United States, as the Nation's 
        largest purchaser of health care services, must learn from 
        these innovators and encourage health care providers to furnish 
        more supportive and comprehensive advanced illness care to 
        improve the efficacy and quality of health care delivered for 
        generations of Americans to come.
            (10) Health care providers who serve individuals with 
        advanced illness face complicated care systems and legal 
        concerns that may result in over- or under-treatment of 
        individuals with advanced illness.
            (11) Individuals have the well-established right to accept 
        or reject medical treatment that is offered, as well as the 
        well-established right to document their preferences for how 
        treatment decisions should be made if, at some point in the 
        future, they lose the ability to make health care decisions.
            (12) Too often, individuals with advanced illness do not 
        understand the conditions they are facing or their treatment 
        options, and they do not receive the information or support 
        they need to evaluate treatment options in light of their 
        personal goals and values and to document treatment plans in a 
        manner that allows providers and facilities to follow their 
        plans.
            (13) Providing quality services and planning support to 
        individuals with advanced illness will protect and preserve 
        their dignity.
