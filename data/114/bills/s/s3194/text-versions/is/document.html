                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to promote healthy eating and 
                   physical activity among children.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Obesity in Youth Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Research has shown that early childhood is an important 
        time for developing dietary and physical activity behaviors 
        that support health and well-being and may help prevent 
        obesity.
            (2) Infants as young as 7 months have shown eating patterns 
        that are similar to older children and adults.
            (3) For children under 1 year of age, promoting 
        opportunities for movement (such as reaching, crawling, and 
        creeping) may be the most effective way to increase physical 
        activity and improve children's motor skills.
            (4) Children who are exposed to healthy foods early are 
        more likely to prefer and eat healthy foods and to develop 
        eating habits that promote healthy growth that can continue 
        throughout childhood.
            (5) Healthy eating can improve a child's learning ability 
        and potentially lead to higher academic performance, along with 
        his or her mental, social, and physical well-being and can 
        contribute to increased self-esteem.
            (6) A 2010 study indicated that daily physical activity is 
        not only essential for healthy weight maintenance, but also for 
        practicing and learning fundamental gross motor skills and 
        socioemotional and cognitive skills. Furthermore, when children 
        have the opportunity for adequate physical activity, they 
        benefit physically, psychologically and socially.
            (7) Nearly 20 percent (1 in 5) of 2-year-olds spend more 
        than 2 hours of a typical day watching television or videos.
            (8) The Journal of the American Medical Association 
        Pediatrics found that each incremental hour of watching 
        television at age 2 is associated with corresponding declines 
        in school engagement, math achievement, and weekend physical 
        activity, and with increases in bullying by classmates, 
        consumption of soft drinks and snacks, and BMI at age 10.
            (9) A major study published in the New England Journal of 
        Medicine, found that a third of children who were overweight in 
        kindergarten were obese by eighth grade. Almost every child who 
        was very obese remained that way, suggesting that efforts must 
        start much earlier and focus more on the children at greatest 
        risk.
            (10) In 2012, three-fourths of United States preschool-aged 
        children were in child care, and most of their day was spent in 
        sedentary activities.
            (11) Center-based programs serve approximately 6,980,000 
        children birth through age 5 years but not yet in kindergarten, 
        making the early childhood care and education setting an 
        important one for promoting healthful habits.
            (12) Early care and education learning collaboratives in 9 
        States have reached nearly 156,000 children and improved early 
        childhood care and education provider practices for nutrition 
        and physical activity.
    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) establish a program that will influence practices, 
        policies, and environments in early care and education settings 
        to support healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time 
        reduction for children ages birth through 5;
            (2) enhance the training and knowledge of early care and 
        education providers on strategies for promoting healthy eating 
        (including early feeding best practices), physical activity, 
        and screen time reduction in early care and education settings;
            (3) monitor progress of healthy eating and physical 
        activity promotion in early care and education settings; and
            (4) identify emerging, and expand existing, approaches to 
        engaging families and parents of children ages birth to 5 in 
        healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time reduction.
