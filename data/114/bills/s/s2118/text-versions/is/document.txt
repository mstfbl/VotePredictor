                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to extend the application 
 of the Medicare payment rate floor to primary care services furnished 
 under Medicaid and to apply the rate floor to additional providers of 
                         primary care services.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Enhanced Access to Primary 
Care Act''.

SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF APPLICATION OF MEDICARE PAYMENT RATE FLOOR TO 
              PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FURNISHED UNDER MEDICAID AND 
              APPLICATION TO ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS.

    (a) Renewal of Payment Floor; Additional Providers.--Section 
1902(a)(13) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)) is 
amended by striking subparagraph (C) and inserting the following:
                    ``(C) payment for primary care services (as defined 
                in subsection (jj)) at a rate that is not less than 100 
                percent of the payment rate that applies to such 
                services and physician under part B of title XVIII (or, 
                if greater, the payment rate that would be applicable 
                under such part if the conversion factor under section 
                1848(d) for the year involved were the conversion 
                factor under such section for 2009), and that is not 
                less than the rate that would otherwise apply to such 
                services under this title if the rate were determined 
                without regard to this subparagraph, and that are--
                            ``(i) furnished in 2013 and 2014, by a 
                        physician with a primary specialty designation 
                        of family medicine, general internal medicine, 
                        or pediatric medicine; or
                            ``(ii) furnished in the 2-year period that 
                        begins on the first day of the first month that 
                        begins after the date of enactment of the 
                        Ensuring Enhanced Access to Primary Care Act--

                                pediatric medicine, but only if the 
                                physician self-attests that the 
                                physician is Board certified in family 
                                medicine, general internal medicine, or 
                                pediatric medicine;
                                    ``(II) by a physician with a 
                                primary specialty designation of 
                                obstetrics and gynecology, but only if 
                                the physician self-attests that the 
                                physician is Board certified in 
                                obstetrics and gynecology; or
                                    ``(III) by physician with a primary 
                                specialty designation of psychiatry or 
                                neurology, but only if the physician 
                                self-attests that the physician is 
                                Board certified in psychiatry or 
                                neurology;''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1905(dd) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(dd)) is amended by inserting ``or furnished during 
the 2-year period that begins on the first day of the first month that 
begins after the date of enactment of the Ensuring Enhanced Access to 
Primary Care Act,'' after ``2015,''.
