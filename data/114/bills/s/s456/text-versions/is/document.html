    It is the sense of Congress that the statement issued by the 
Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on April 10, 
2014 entitled ``Antitrust Policy Statement On Sharing Of Cybersecurity 
Information'' provides protections against antitrust concerns for the 
legitimate sharing of cyber threat indicators (as defined in section 
229 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by section 2)).
