    (a) In General.--For the one-year period beginning on the date of 
the enactment of this Act, subject to subsection (b), no funds 
authorized or appropriated by Federal law may be made available for any 
purpose to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any 
affiliate or clinic of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc.,

America affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not provide 
any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion during such 
period.
    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to an abortion--
            (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
        incest; or
            (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical 
        disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as 
        certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death 
        unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering 
        physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
        itself.
    (c) Repayment.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall seek repayment of any Federal assistance 
received by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any

(a) during the period specified in subsection (a).
