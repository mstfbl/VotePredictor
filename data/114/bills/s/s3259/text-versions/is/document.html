_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To establish scientific standards and protocols across forensic 
                  disciplines, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Forensic Science and Standards Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) at the direction of Congress, the National Academy of 
        Sciences led a comprehensive review of the state of forensic 
        science and issued its findings in a 2009 report, 
        ``Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path 
        Forward'';
            (2) the report's findings indicate the need for independent 
        scientific research to support the foundation of forensic 
        disciplines;
            (3) the report stresses the need for standards in methods, 
        data interpretation, and reporting, and the importance of 
        preventing cognitive bias and mitigating human factors; and
            (4) according to the report, forensic science research is 
        not financially well-supported, and there is need for a unified 
        strategy for developing a forensic science research plan across 
        Federal agencies.

            (1) In general.--The Director of the National Institute of 
        Standards and Technology shall establish scientific area 
        committees to identify gaps in and opportunities for standards 
        development in the forensic sciences. The scientific area 
        committees shall be administered by the Director of the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology.
            (2) Duties.--
                    (A) In general.--The scientific area committees 
                shall be the primary mechanism for identifying and 
                coordinating the development of voluntary consensus 
                forensic science standards as described in subsection 
                (a). The scientific area committees shall submit, for 
                consideration by forensic science stakeholders and by 
                the Commission established in section 9, 
                recommendations on these forensic science standards. In 
                accomplishing this objective, the scientific area 
                committees shall--
                            (i) encourage information exchange within 
                        the forensic science community, to include 
                        researchers, practitioners, law enforcement, 
                        and legal professionals;
                            (ii) ensure that standards development is 
                        appropriate to the needs of the forensic 
                        science community and relevant to practical 
                        applications;
                            (iii) take into account existing studies 
                        and reports; and
                            (iv) support public participation in the 
                        standards development process and the broad 
                        adoption of forensic science standards by 
                        holding public meetings and disseminating work 
                        products for public review and comment to the 
                        extent practicable.
                    (B) Validation of recommendations.--A 
                recommendation on a forensic science standard under 
                subparagraph (A) may not be published in the Federal 
                Register until it has been subject to the validation 
                program described in subsection (b).
            (3) Members.--The scientific area committees shall have 
        significant representation from forensic science practitioners, 
        academic researchers, and statisticians to balance scientific 
        rigor with practical and regulatory constraints, and, to the 
        extent practicable, the majority of the scientific area 
        committees shall have a minimum representation of 50 percent 
        from forensic science practitioners. Each member of a 
        scientific area committee shall have significant academic, 
        research, or practical expertise in a discipline of forensic 
        science or in another area relevant to the purpose of the 
        scientific area committee.
            (4) Federal advisory committee act.--A scientific area 
        committee established under this subsection shall not be 
        subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).

SEC. 9. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FORENSIC SCIENCE.

    (a) Establishment.--The Director of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology and the Attorney General, in consultation with
