        qualifying legislation has been referred has not reported such 
        qualifying legislation within 10 session days after the date of 
        referral of such legislation, that committee shall be

        calendar.
            ``(6) Floor consideration in house of representatives.--
                    ``(A) Proceeding to consideration.--After each

                discharged from its consideration, it shall be in order 
                to move to proceed to consider the qualifying 
                legislation in the House. All points of order against 
                the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in 
                order after the House has disposed of a motion to 
                proceed on the qualifying legislation. The previous 
                question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
                to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion 
                shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote 
                by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in 
                order.
                    ``(B) Consideration.--The qualifying legislation 
                shall be considered as read. All points of order 
                against the qualifying legislation and against its 
                consideration are waived. The previous question shall 
                be considered as ordered on the qualifying legislation 
                to its passage without intervening motion except 2 
                hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
                proponent and an opponent. A motion to reconsider the 
                vote on passage of the qualifying legislation shall not 
                be in order. No amendment to, or motion to recommit, 
                qualifying legislation shall be in order.
                    ``(C) Appeals.--All appeals from the Chair relating 
                to the application of the Rules of the House of 
                Representatives to the procedure relating to the 
                qualifying legislation shall be decided without debate.

                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the 
                Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any 
                time after the committee authorized to consider 
                qualifying legislation reports it to the Senate or has 
                been discharged from its consideration (even though a 
                previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed 
                to) to move to proceed to the consideration of 
                qualifying legislation, and all points of order against 
                qualifying legislation (and against consideration of 
                the qualifying legislation) are waived. The motion to 
                proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to 
                a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote 
                by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall 
                not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of the qualifying legislation is agreed 
                to, the qualifying legislation shall remain the 
                unfinished business until disposed of.

                and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, 
                which shall be divided equally between the majority and 
                minority leaders or their designees. A motion to 
                further limit debate is in order and not debatable. An 
                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
                motion to recommit the qualifying legislation is not in 
                order.
                    ``(C) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall 
                occur immediately following the conclusion of the 
                debate on the qualifying legislation and a single 
                quorum call at the conclusion of the debate, if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.
                    ``(D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may 
                be, to the procedure relating to qualifying legislation 
                shall be decided without debate.

                the Senate of any veto message with respect to 
                qualifying legislation, including all debatable motions 
                and appeals in connection with such qualifying 
                legislation, shall be limited to 10 hours, to be 
                equally divided between, and controlled by, the 
                majority leader and the minority leader or their 
                designees.

        representatives.--

                Senate, the Senate then receives a companion measure 
                from the House of Representatives, the companion 
                measure shall not be debatable.

is enacted by Congress--
            ``(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such are 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but
