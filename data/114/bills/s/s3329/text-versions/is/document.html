                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure transparent enforcement of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
                                Action.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``JCPOA Enforcement Transparency Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States entered into the Joint Comprehensive 
        Plan of Action (JCPOA) on July 14, 2015, without the approval 
        of Congress.
            (2) The JCPOA established the Joint Commission in Annex IV 
        of the agreement.
            (3) The JCPOA placed detailed limitations on components of 
        Iran's nuclear agreement, and required those limitations to be 
        met by Implementation Day, which took place on January 16, 
        2016.
            (4) The Joint Commission provided alternate arrangements 
        regarding some Iranian nuclear stocks and facilities prior to 
        January 16, 2016.
            (5) The JCPOA capped Iran's stockpile of low enriched 
        uranium (LEU) at 300 kilograms (kg).
            (6) Iran was granted an exemption to retain more than 300 
        kg of LEU by the Joint Commission.
            (7) The JCPOA required all Iranian uranium oxide enriched 
        to between 5 percent and 20 percent to be fabricated into fuel 
        plates for the Tehran Research Reactor or transferred outside 
        of Iran or diluted to an enrichment level of 3.67 percent or 
        less.
            (8) The Joint Commission found near 20 percent LEU in ``lab 
        contaminant'' that was judged as unrecoverable.
            (9) Under the JCPOA, Iran committed to only develop, 
        acquire, build, or operate hot cells, shielded cells, or 
        shielded glove boxes with dimensions less than 6 cubic meters 
        for 15 years.
            (10) Prior to Implementation Day, the Joint Commission 
        agreed to allow Iran to continue operating 19 large hot cells 
        in three Tehran locations and one Karaj location which are in 
        excess of the 6 cubic meter limitation.
            (11) In July 2016, the Joint Commission established a 
        Technical Working Group to evaluate stocks of Iranian 3.67 
        percent LEU and other stocks.
            (12) Ensuring Iranian compliance with the JCPOA is 
        tantamount to restricting breakout times for the development of 
        a nuclear weapon.
            (13) The current Administration's policy to maintain 
        secrecy on the decisions of the Joint Commission and its 
        Technical Working Group interferes in the process of 
        establishing adequate congressional and public oversight of the 
        JCPOA.

SEC. 3. NOTIFICATION AND JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR DECISIONS ISSUED 
              BY THE JOINT COMMISSION AND TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP.

            (2) not later than 30 days after each subsequent decision
