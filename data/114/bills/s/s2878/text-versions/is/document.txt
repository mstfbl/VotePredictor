        security agencies, the diplomatic services, and other

              LARGE FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

    (a) In General.--Section 101 of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6411) is amended--

                adviser to'' before ``the Secretary of State'';
                    (C) in paragraph (3)--
                            (i) in subparagraph (A), by striking 
                        ``and'' at the end;
                            (ii) in subparagraph (B), by striking the 
                        period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and
                            (iii) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(C) contacts with nongovernmental organizations 
                that have an impact on the state of religious freedom

                    (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph 
                (5); and
                    (E) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:
            ``(4) Coordination responsibilities.--In order to promote 
        religious freedom as an interest of United States foreign 
        policy, the Ambassador at Large--
                    ``(A) shall coordinate international religious 
                freedom policies across all programs, projects, and 
                activities of the United States; and
                    ``(B) should participate in any interagency 
                processes on issues in which the promotion of 
                international religious freedom policy can advance 
                United States national security interests, including in 
                democracy promotion, stability, security, and 
                development globally.''; and
            (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the Office'' 
        and all that follows through the period at the end and 
        inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time 
        equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff 
        positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the Annual 
        Report under the direct supervision of the Ambassador at Large, 
        and for the conduct of investigations by the Office and for 
        necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this Act. The 
        Secretary of State should also provide to the Ambassador at 
        Large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties 
        described in this section, including as necessary 
        representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided 
        to other Ambassadors at Large in the Department of State.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Because international religious freedom is 
a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs coordination across 
many regional bureaus and among Special Envoys and Special 
Representatives with overlapping mandates, the Secretary of State 
should consider elevating the office of International Religious Freedom 
and the position of the Ambassador at Large for International Religious 
Freedom to the Office of the Secretary, similar to other Ambassador at 
Large positions that now report directly to the Secretary. Providing 
the Office of International Religious Freedom with additional resources 
and status will demonstrate both the strategic importance of 
international religious freedom policy within the State Department 
bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally that the U.S. 
gives priority to the protection and promotion of international 
religious freedom as mandated by the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998.

SEC. 102. ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

    (a) In General.--Section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)) is amended--

        ``September 1'' and inserting ``May 1'';
            (2) in subparagraph (A)--
                    (A) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (vii); 
                and
                    (B) by inserting after clause (iii) the following 
                new clauses:

                        government does not exist or the government

                politicians, or other human rights advocates seeking to 
                defend the rights of members of religious groups or

                ritual animal slaughter or male infant circumcision,'' 
                after ``entire religions,''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``policies that ban or restrict 
                the public manifestation of religious belief and the 
                peaceful involvement of religious groups or their

                country,'' after ``such groups,'';

                comprehensive description'';
                    (B) by striking ``policies in support'' and 
                inserting ``diplomatic and political coordination 
                efforts, and other policies in support''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end before the period the 
                following: ``, and a comprehensive and country-specific 
                analysis of the impact of actions by the United States 
                on the status of religious freedom in each such

            (5) in subparagraph (F)--
                    (A) in clause (i)--
                            (i) by striking ``section 402(b)(1)'' and

                            (ii) by adding at the end the following:

                        Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom 
                        Act is located shall be included in this 
                        section of the report.''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(iii) Special watch list.--A list, to be 
                        known as the `Special Watch List', which shall 
                        identify each country that engages in or 
                        tolerates severe violations of religious 
                        freedom during the previous year but which the 
                        President determines does not meet, at the time 
                        of the publication of the Annual Report, all of 
                        the criteria described in section 3(11) for 
                        designation under section 402(b)(1).''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the original intent of the International Religious 
        Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to require 
        annual reports from both the Department of State and the 
        Commission on International Religious Freedom to be delivered 
        each year, during the same calendar year, and with at least 5 
        months separating these reports, in order to provide updated 
        information for policymakers, Members of Congress, and 
        nongovernmental organizations; and
            (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights 
        Practices no longer contain updated information on religious 
        freedom conditions globally, it is important that the 
        Department of State and the Commission work together to fulfill 
        the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act 
        of 1998.

        in the scope and strategic value of international religious 
        freedom, how violations of international religious freedom harm 
        fundamental United States interests, how the advancement of 
        international religious freedom can advance such interests, how 
        United States international religious freedom policy should be 
        carried out in practice by United States diplomats and other 
        Foreign Service officers, and the relevance and relationship of 
        international religious freedom to United States defense,

Executive Office of the President, with the primary responsibility to 
serve as a resource for executive branch officials on international 
religious freedom, compiling and maintaining information on the facts 
and circumstances of violations of religious freedom (as defined in 
section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998), and 
making relevant policy recommendations to advance United States 
international religious freedom policy. The Special Advisor should also 
assist the Ambassador at Large to coordinate international religious 
freedom policies and strategies throughout the executive branch and 
within any interagency policy committees where the Ambassador at Large 
participates.''.

            (1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in

        such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for 
        religious freedom.
    (b) Report.--Whenever the President designates a non-state actor 
under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for religious 
freedom, the President shall, as soon as practicable after the 
designation is made, submit to the appropriate congressional committees 
a report detailing the reasons for such designation.
    (c) Actions.--The President should take specific actions to address 
severe violations of religious freedom of non-state actors that are

(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)).
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of State should work with Congress to create new political, 
financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations of 
religious freedom by non-state actors and to update the actions the 
President can take in section 405 of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998.
    (f) Determinations of Responsible Parties.--In order to 
appropriately target Presidential actions under the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 in response, the President shall with 
respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of particular 
concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), seek to determine 
the specific officials or members thereof that are responsible for the 
particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or 
tolerated by that entity.
    (g) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``appropriate 
congressional committees'', ``non-state actor'', and ``particularly 
severe violations of religious freedom'' have the meanings given such 
terms in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6402), as amended by section 3 of this Act.

                TITLE IV--PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

SEC. 401. ASSISTANCE FOR PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

    (a) Availability of Assistance.--It is the sense of Congress that 
for each fiscal year that begins on or after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Department of State should make available--
            (1) an amount equal to not less than 10 percent of the 
        amounts available in that fiscal year for the Human Rights and 
        Democracy Fund for the promotion of international religious 
        freedom and for projects to advance United States interests in 
        the protection and advancement of international religious 
        freedom, in particular, through grants to--
                    (A) groups that are able to develop legal 
                protections or promote cultural and societal 
                understanding of international norms of religious 
                freedom;
                    (B) groups that seek to address and mitigate 
                religiously motivated and sectarian violence and combat 
                violent extremism; and
                    (C) groups that seek to strengthen investigations, 
                reporting, and monitoring of religious freedom 
                violations, including genocide perpetrated against 
                religious minorities; and
            (2) an amount equal to not less than 2 percent of amounts 
        available in that fiscal year for the Human Rights and 
        Democracy Fund to be made available for the establishment of a 
        Religious Freedom Defense Fund, administered by the Ambassador 
        at Large for International Religious Freedom, to provide grants 
        for--
                    (A) victims of religious freedom abuses and their 
                families to cover legal and other expenses that may 
                arise from detention, imprisonment, torture, fines, and 
                other restrictions; and
                    (B) projects to help create and support training of 
                a new generation of defenders of religious freedom, 
                including legal and political advocates, and civil 
                society projects which seek to create advocacy 
                networks, strengthen legal representation, train and 
                educate new religious freedom defenders, and build the 
                capacity of religious communities and rights defenders 
                to protect against religious freedom violations, 
                mitigate societal or sectarian violence, or minimize 
                legal or other restrictions of the right to freedom of 
                religion.
    (b) Preference.--It is the sense of Congress that, in providing 
grants under subsection (a), the Ambassador at Large for International 
Religious Freedom should, as appropriate, give preference to projects 
targeting religious freedom violations in countries designated as 
countries of particular concern for religious freedom under section 
402(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 
6442(b)(1)) and countries included on the Special Watch List described 
in section 102(b)(1)(F)(iii) of the International Religious Freedom Act 
of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)(F)(iii)).
    (c) Administration and Consultations.--
            (1) Administration.--Amounts made available in accordance 
        with subsection (a) shall be administered by the Ambassador at 
        Large for International Religious Freedom.
            (2) Consultations.--In developing priorities and policies 
        for providing grants in accordance with subsection (a), 
        including priorities and policies for identification of 
        potential grantees, the Ambassador at Large for International 
        Religious Freedom shall consult with other Federal agencies, 
        including the United States Commission on International 
        Religious Freedom and, as appropriate, nongovernmental 
        organizations.

SEC. 601. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

    Title VII of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6481 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 702. VOLUNTARY CODES OF CONDUCT FOR UNITED STATES INSTITUTIONS 
              OF HIGHER EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

    ``(a) Finding.--Congress recognizes the enduring importance of 
United States institutions of higher education worldwide both for their 
potential for shaping positive leadership and new educational models in 
host countries and for their emphasis on teaching universally 
recognized rights of free inquiry and academic freedom.
    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United 
States institutions of higher education operating campuses outside the 
United States or establishing any educational entities with foreign 
governments, particularly with or in countries the governments of which 
engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom as 
identified in the Annual Report, should seek to adopt a voluntary code 
of conduct for operating in such countries that should--
            ``(1) uphold the right of freedom of religion of their 
        employees and students, including the right to manifest that 
        religion peacefully as protected in international law;
            ``(2) ensure that the religious views and peaceful practice 
        of religion in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, the 
        status of a worker's or faculty member's employment or a 
        student's enrollment; and
            ``(3) make every effort in all negotiations, contracts, or 
        memoranda of understanding engaged in or constructed with a 
        foreign government to protect academic freedom and the rights 
        enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

``SEC. 703. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY TO 
              PROMOTE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THROUGH UNITED STATES FOREIGN 
              POLICY.

    ``It is the sense of Congress that--
            ``(1) the annual national security strategy report of the 
        President required by section 108 of the National Security Act 
        of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) should promote international religious 
        freedom as a foreign policy and national security priority and 
        should articulate that promotion of the right to freedom of 
        religion is a strategy that protects other, related human 
        rights, and advances democracy outside the United States, and 
        make clear its importance to United States foreign policy goals 
        of stability, security, development, and diplomacy; and
            ``(2) the national security strategy report should be a 
        guide for the strategies and activities of relevant Federal 
        agencies and inform the Department of Defense quadrennial 
        defense review under section 118 of title 10, United States 
        Code, and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and 
        Development Review.''.

                            of Religious Freedom.'';
        and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:

``Sec. 702. Voluntary codes of conduct for United States institutions 
                            of higher education operating outside the 
                            United States.
