SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) many areas of undeveloped National Forest System land, 
        National Park System land, and public land administered by the 
        Bureau of Land Management in the States of Idaho, Montana, 
        Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming (referred to in this section as 
        ``public land'')--
                    (A) possess outstanding natural characteristics 
                that give the areas value as wildernesses, parks, or 
                wild and scenic rivers; and
                    (B) if properly preserved, will be an enduring 
                resource as wildernesses and wildland areas and of 
                biodiversity for the benefit of the people of the 
                United States;
            (2) the Northern Rockies Bioregion--
                    (A) contains the most diverse array of wildland 
                that remains in the United States south of Canada;
                    (B) provides a sanctuary for species listed as 
                threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species 
                Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);
                    (C) is national interest public land that is among 
                the most popular wildland in the United States; and
                    (D) embraces greater ecosystems and national 
                treasures such as the Greater Yellowstone, Greater 
                Glacier/Northern Continental Divide, Greater Hells 
                Canyon/Wallowa, Greater Salmon/Selway, and Greater 
                Cabinet/Yaak/Selkirk ecosystems;
            (3) the natural ecosystems in the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion are largely dependent on--
                    (A) public land; and
                    (B) the ecological productivity and diversity of 
                resources on public land;
            (4) conservation of roadless areas on public land--
                    (A) produces clean water;
                    (B) protects native fisheries and native flora and 
                fauna;
                    (C) provides scenic and recreational qualities; and
                    (D) preserves options for sustainable economics 
                through activities such as hunting, fishing, and 
                wilderness-based recreation;
            (5) the headwaters of several major river systems, 
        including the Columbia, Snake, Green, Missouri, and 
        Saskatchewan Rivers, are in the Northern Rockies Bioregion, and 
        the water of those rivers--
                    (A) flows to 3 oceans;
                    (B) is of economic importance to farming and 
                ranching operations, municipal water supplies, and 
                water-based recreation, including fishing and boating; 
                and
                    (C) if protected, will enhance the uses described 
                in subparagraph (B), reduce costs for water treatment 
                and irrigation, and increase native fish populations;
            (6) the wildlife treasures of the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion are of international significance and contain intact, 
        large mammalian fauna and rare and unique plant life;
            (7) wildlife habitat fragmentation due to road building, 
        timber harvesting, mining, oil and gas exploration, lack of 
        interagency cooperation, and other activities has severe 
        effects on--
                    (A) the wildlife populations of the Northern 
                Rockies Bioregion (including populations of species 
                listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
                Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)) and the 
                habitats of the wildlife; and
                    (B) the water quality, ancient forests, and greater 
                ecosystems of the Northern Rockies Bioregion;
            (8) the overemphasis on resource extraction from public 
        land has--
                    (A) compromised ecosystem integrity and detracted 
                from economic diversification opportunities; and
                    (B) resulted in economic instability and high 
                unemployment in rural, resource-dependent communities;
            (9) the fragmentation and development of the remaining 
        roadless and essentially roadless ecosystems and biological 
        connectors of the Northern Rockies Bioregion would cause a loss 
        to the United States of--
                    (A) an entire wildland region; and
                    (B) the only remaining area in the United States 
                south of Canada that can support populations of 
                caribou, gray wolves, grizzly bears, anadromous fish, 
                and other rare or endangered plant or animal life in 1 
                intact bioregion;
            (10) since the completion of the 1936 roadless area 
        inventory by Bob Marshall, millions of acres of roadless 
        wildland have been developed in the Northern Rockies Bioregion;
            (11) extensive fragmentation of wildland and wildlife 
        habitat has--
                    (A) resulted in the listing of several species as 
                threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species 
                Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.); and
                    (B) reduced the number and range of other species, 
                including anadromous fish;
            (12) the natural ecosystems of the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion serve as educational and research centers for onsite 
        studies in biology, geology, astronomy, and other sciences;
            (13) the pristine nature of public land helps local 
        communities attract new residents and businesses based on local 
        quality of life;
            (14) a review of the situation in the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion as of the date of enactment of this Act has revealed 
        the urgent need for an ecological reserve system for the 
        Northern Rockies Bioregion that includes core ecosystem reserve 
        areas and biological connecting corridors necessary to ensure 
        wildlife movements and genetic interchange between the core 
        reserve areas;
            (15) wildlife freedom of movement is essential to the 
        survival of wildlife species, and a number of scientific 
        studies have identified movement corridors as necessary for 
        wildlife conservation in a changing climate;
            (16) several foreign governments, including the governments 
        of Australia and Scotland, have announced plans for corridors 
        that would make wildlife movement possible as climate pressures 
        increase;
            (17) the concept of connective corridors for wildlife 
        movement--
                    (A) has been endorsed by the Governors of States in 
                the western United States; and
                    (B) is recognized by conservation and scientific 
                organizations, such as the National Academy of 
                Sciences, which, in 2008, described freedom of movement 
                for wildlife as basic to the emerging new science of 
                movement ecology;
            (18) freedom of wildlife movement--
                    (A) was a fundamental reason for the development 
                and introduction of this Act; and
                    (B) has become an increasingly high-profile issue 
                in the climate and biological sciences;
            (19) the economic value to the United States of most of the 
        public land, left in its natural state, exceeds any potential 
        return to the Treasury of the United States from timber harvest 
        and development;
            (20) if Federal land management in the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion continues to result in development in roadless areas, 
        the Federal Government will be using tax revenues to fund 
        permanent reductions in wilderness, water quality, fish and 
        wildlife habitat, species, and biological diversity;
            (21) this Act--
                    (A) provides opportunities for employment in 
                outdoor trades by establishing rehabilitation zones on 
                specific tracts of damaged Federal land where active 
                restoration work will occur;
                    (B) will provide contracts for local businesses; 
                and
                    (C) will renew the intrinsic economic, social, and 
                cultural benefits that result from productive land;
            (22) Federal land rehabilitation projects--
                    (A) have direct benefits to local economies; and
                    (B) reduce the loss to taxpayers in the United 
                States caused by below-cost timber sales and other 
                subsidized resource extraction;
            (23) a congressional review of roadless areas within public 
        land identifies--
                    (A) areas that, on the basis of the land form, 
                ecosystem, associated fish and wildlife, economic 
                value, and location of the areas, will help to fulfill 
                the role of the Forest Service, National Park Service, 
                and Bureau of Land Management to ensure a quality 
                National Wilderness Preservation System;
                    (B) areas that may have value as wild and scenic 
                rivers; and
                    (C) areas that--
                            (i) may not possess wilderness attributes 
                        and should not now be designated as components 
                        of the National Wilderness Preservation System; 
                        and
                            (ii) should be studied to determine the 
                        role of the areas in maintaining biological 
                        diversity in the Northern Rockies Bioregion;
            (24) many areas of public land--
                    (A) have been damaged and experienced a reduction 
                in productivity due to unwise development practices, 
                which have also impaired ecosystem function and 
                biological diversity, such as the Island Park area 
                adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, which contains 
                large clear-cut areas that border the park boundary; 
                and
                    (B) should be returned to the former ecological 
                health and native diversity of the areas through 
                efforts--
                            (i) to ensure that vital ecosystem 
                        components are restored, especially in areas in 
                        which wildlife travel corridors and native fish 
                        and wildlife populations have been damaged or 
                        eliminated; and
                            (ii) to ensure and maintain genetic 
                        interchange, biological diversity, and 
                        restoration of native species diversity 
                        throughout the Northern Rockies Bioregion;
            (25) backcountry areas of the National Park System have 
        been damaged by inappropriate management, despite policies that 
        require that recommended wilderness be administered as 
        wilderness;
            (26) an emphasis on structures and motorized equipment, and 
        in some instances developed backcountry campsites, in 
        backcountry areas of the National Park System has detracted 
        from and degraded the wilderness character of those backcountry 
        areas;
            (27) Federal agencies entrusted with managing the natural 
        resources of the Northern Rockies Bioregion--
                    (A) operate under contradictory congressional 
                mandates; and
                    (B) are in dissension over management policies that 
                involve common resources and greater ecosystems;
            (28) Federal agency structures and regulatory mechanisms as 
        of the date of enactment of this Act have proven unsatisfactory 
        for the responsible management of nationally important 
        ecosystems on public land;
            (29) Federal laws and regulations as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act have not been sufficient to establish and 
        maintain the accountability of Federal agencies for public 
        resources; and
            (30) this Act does not affect private existing rights.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    (a) In General.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to designate certain National Forest System land, 
        certain National Park System land, and certain public land 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the States of 
        Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming as components 
        of the National Wilderness Preservation System;
            (2) to designate certain National Forest System land, 
        certain public land administered by the Bureau of Land 
        Management, and watercourses on that National Forest System 
        land and public land in the States of Montana, Idaho, and 
        Wyoming as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers 
        System;
            (3) to prioritize areas for wildland recovery to help 
        restore biological diversity and native species; and
            (4) to establish a system of biological connecting 
        corridors between the core ecosystems in the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion.
    (b) Purpose of Designations.--The designations of land made by this 
Act are made--
            (1) to promote, perpetuate, and preserve the wilderness 
        character of the designated land;
            (2) to protect water quality, watersheds, and wildlife 
        habitats, including the habitats of species listed as 
        threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);
            (3) to protect the ecological integrity and contiguity of 
        major wildland ecosystems and the interconnecting corridors of 
        the ecosystems identified by the Director of the United States 
        Fish and Wildlife Service or another official;
            (4) to protect and maintain biological and native species 
        diversity and dispersal throughout the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion;
            (5) to promote and ensure interagency cooperation in the 
        implementation of integrated, holistic ecosystem management and 
        protection of the ecosystems and corridors covered by this Act 
        based on principles from conservation biology;
            (6) to preserve scenic, historic, and cultural resources;
            (7) to promote scientific research, primitive recreation, 
        solitude, physical and mental challenges, and inspiration for 
        the benefit of the people of the United States;
            (8) to avoid the misinvestment of scarce capital in land of 
        marginal timber value; and
            (9) to promote ecologically and economically sustainable 
        management in the Northern Rockies Bioregion.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Corridor.--The term ``corridor'' means an area that 
        provides connectivity of habitat or potential habitat, and that 
        facilitates the ability of terrestrial, estuarine, and 
        freshwater fish, or wildlife, to move within a landscape--
                    (A) as needed for migration, gene flow, or 
                dispersal; or
                    (B) in response to the impacts of climate change or 
                other impacts.
            (2) Development.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``development'' means an 
                activity that eliminates the roadless and wilderness 
                characteristics of the land on which the activity takes 
                place.
                    (B) Inclusions.--The term ``development'' includes 
                the construction or operation of a ski resort facility, 
                road building, timber harvesting, mining, and oil and 
                gas drilling.
            (3) Greater ecosystem.--The term ``greater ecosystem'', 
        when used in conjunction with a specific ecosystem described in 
        this Act, means an ecological land unit--
                    (A)(i) of sufficient scale to support and maintain 
                populations of large vertebrate species and the other 
                native plant and animal species of the unit; and
                    (ii) comprised of land that is similar in

               TITLE II--BIOLOGICAL CONNECTING CORRIDORS

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that, as of the date of enactment of this Act--
            (1) the most recent scientific information on ecological 
        reserve design and function, including recent scientific 
        information on species dispersal in response to a changing 
        climate, points out the critical need for biological connecting 
        corridors between the larger core ecosystem areas;
            (2) while none of the remaining major wild land ecosystems 
        of the Northern Rockies Bioregion appears to be of sufficient 
        size to perpetuate the full complement of self-sustaining 
        viable populations of native wildlife, biological diversity, 
        and full range of ecological processes on its own, it appears 
        that an effective reserve system can be achieved if biological 
        connecting corridors between the ecosystems are identified and 
        protected;
            (3) the wild land areas addressed by this title are located 
        between the major core ecosystems of the region and are 
        essential for wildlife and plant migration and genetic 
        interchange; and
            (4) these areas are some of the most beautiful and wild 
        mountain ranges in the United States, including the Bitterroot, 
        Sapphire, Lost River, Lemhi, and Bridger mountain ranges.
