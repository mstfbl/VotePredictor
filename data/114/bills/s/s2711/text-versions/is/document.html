                such student for the applicable school year under 
                sections 1127 and 1130.
            ``(2) Notification to states if additional reimbursement is 
        available.--In any case where the reimbursement available for 
        an ESA eligible student for a school year exceeds the amount of 
        the grant provided by the State under the education savings

                eligible student and desires a reimbursement under this 
                subsection shall submit a request for reimbursement and 
                notify the Secretary that includes the amount of the 
                grant.
                    ``(B) Reimbursement.--Not later than 30 days after 
                the Secretary receives a request for reimbursement 
                under subparagraph (A) from a State, the Secretary will 
                reimburse a State for the grant.
            ``(4) Return of overpayments.--A State shall return to the 
        Secretary any overpayment made to the State under this section 
        by not later than 30 days after the final determination that 
        the State was overpaid pursuant to this section.
    ``(c) Affect on Allotments.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of any calculation 
        regarding the total number of eligible Indian students under

        program.
            ``(2) Availability of remainder.--In any case where the 
        reimbursement provided by the Secretary under subsection (b)(1) 
        is less than the amount that would be provided for the student 
        under subsection (b)(1)(B), the remaining amount shall remain 
        available to the Secretary to be used in accordance with this 
        part.
    ``(d) Information.--The Secretary shall work with Bureau-funded

participate in the program.
    ``(e) Rule of Construction.--The reimbursement provided through an 
education savings account program on behalf of an ESA eligible student

shall not be considered assistance to a school that enrolls the 
eligible student or any other educational service provider from which 
the eligible student receives services. The amounts provided on behalf 
of an ESA eligible student under this section shall not be treated as
