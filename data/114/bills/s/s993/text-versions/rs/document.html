SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals with serious mental 
        illnesses are booked into jails each year, resulting in 
        prevalence rates of serious mental illness in jails that are 3 
        to 6 times higher than in the general population. An even 
        greater number of individuals who are detained in jails each 
        year have mental health problems that do not rise to the level 
        of a serious mental illness but may still require a resource-
        intensive response.
            (2) Adults with mental illnesses cycle through jails more 
        often than individuals without mental illnesses, and tend to 
        stay longer (including before trial, during trial, and after 
        sentencing).
            (3) According to estimates, almost \3/4\ of jail detainees 
        with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring substance use 
        disorders, and individuals with mental illnesses are also much 
        more likely to have serious physical health needs.
            (4) Among individuals under probation supervision, 
        individuals with mental disorders are nearly twice as likely as 
        other individuals to have their community sentence revoked, 
        furthering their involvement in the criminal justice system. 
        Reasons for revocation may be directly or indirectly related to 
        an individual's mental disorder.

Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3797aa) is amended by redesignating
