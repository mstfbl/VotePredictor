SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. REQUIRED PERIODIC DISCLOSURES DURING PERIODS WHEN LOAN PAYMENTS 
              ARE NOT REQUIRED.

    Section 433 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1083) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Required Periodic Disclosures During Periods When Loan 
Payments Are Not Required.--During any period of time when a borrower 
of one or more loans, made, insured, or guaranteed under this part or 
part D is not required to make a payment to an eligible lender on the 
borrower's loan from that eligible lender, such eligible lender shall 
provide such borrower with a statement that corresponds to each payment 
installment time period in which a payment would be due if payments 
were required to be made, and that includes, in simple and 
understandable terms--
            ``(1) the original principal amount of each of the 
        borrower's loans, and the original principal amount of those 
        loans in the aggregate;
            ``(2) the borrower's current balance, as of the time of the 
        statement, as applicable;
            ``(3) the interest rate on each loan;
            ``(4) the total amount the borrower has paid in interest on 
        each loan;
            ``(5) the aggregate amount the borrower has paid for each 
        loan, including the amount the borrower has paid in interest, 
        the amount the borrower has paid in fees, and the amount the 
        borrower has paid against the balance;
            ``(6) the lender's or loan servicer's address and toll-free 
        phone number for payment and billing error purposes;
            ``(7) an explanation--
                    ``(A) that the borrower has the option to pay the 
                interest that accrues on each loan while the borrower 
                is a student at an institution of higher education or 
                during a period of deferment or forbearance, if 
                applicable; and
                    ``(B) if the borrower does not pay such interest 
                while attending an institution or during a period of 
                deferment or forbearance, any accumulated interest on 
                the loan will be capitalized when the loan goes into 
                repayment, resulting in more interest being paid over 
                the life of the loan;
            ``(8) the amount of interest that has accumulated since the 
        last statement based on the typical installment time period and 
        the aggregate interest accrued to date; and
            ``(9) a suggested payment amount equal to the interest 
        charged since the last installment time period.''.

                        disbursement of each new loan (or the first 
                        disbursement in each award year if more than

                                incurred, and the estimated future debt 
                                required to complete the program of 
                                study; and''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:

                the minimum amount necessary to cover expenses and that 
                the borrower does not have to accept the full amount of 
                loans for which the borrower is eligible.
                    ``(M) A warning that the higher the borrower's 
                debt-to-income ratio is, the more difficulty the 
                borrower is likely to experience in repaying the loan.
                    ``(N) Options for reducing borrowing through 
                scholarships, reduced expenses, work-study, or other 
                work opportunities.

                graduating on time to avoid additional borrowing, what 
                course load is necessary to graduate on time, and 
                information on how adding an additional year of study 
                impacts total indebtedness.''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) In addition to the other requirements of this 
        subsection, each eligible institution shall, prior to

        to a student (other than a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan or 
        a Federal Direct PLUS loan made on behalf of a student), ensure 
        that the student manually enter, either in writing or through
