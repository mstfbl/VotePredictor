                                 A BILL


 
   To provide for Federal agencies to develop public access policies 
  relating to research conducted by employees of that agency or from 
                   funds administered by that agency.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Science and 
Technology Research Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Federal Government funds basic and applied 
        research with the expectation that new ideas and discoveries 
        that result from the research, if shared and effectively 
        disseminated, will advance science and improve the lives and 
        welfare of people of the United States and around the 
        world;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Internet makes it possible for this 
        information to be promptly available to every scientist, 
        physician, educator, and citizen at home, in school, or in a 
        library; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the United States has a substantial interest 
        in maximizing the impact and utility of the research it funds 
        by enabling a wide range of reuses of the peer-reviewed 
        literature that reports the results of such research, including 
        by enabling computational analysis by state-of-the-art 
        technologies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        enabling computational analysis by state-of-the-art 
        technologies;
            (4) the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a 
        policy memorandum dated February 22, 2013, which established 
        the commitment of the executive branch of the Federal 
        Government to ensuring that ``the direct results of Federally 
        funded scientific research are made available to and useful for 
        the public, industry, and the scientific community''; and
            (5) the executive branch advises that such public access 
        should be implemented ``with the fewest constraints possible''.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL AGENCY.

    In this Act, the term ``Federal agency'' means an Executive agency, 
as defined under section 105 of title 5, United States Code.

SEC. 4. FEDERAL RESEARCH PUBLIC ACCESS POLICY.

    (a) Requirement To Develop Policy.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, each Federal agency with annual 
        extramural research expenditures of over $100,000,000 shall 
        develop a Federal research public access policy that is 
        consistent with and advances the purposes of the Federal 
        agency.
            (2) Common procedures.--To the extent practicable, Federal 
        agencies required to develop a policy under paragraph (1) shall 
        follow common procedures for the collection and depositing of 
        research papers.
    (b) Content.--Each Federal research public access policy shall 
provide for--
            (1) submission to a digital repository designated or 
        maintained by the Federal agency of an electronic version of 
        the author's final manuscript of original research papers that 
        have been accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals 
        and that result from research supported, in whole or in part, 
        from funding by the Federal Government;
            (2) the incorporation of all changes resulting from the 
        peer review publication process in the manuscript described 
        under paragraph (1);

        in peer-reviewed journals, preferably sooner, or as adjusted 
        under established mechanisms;
            (5) a means, using established mechanisms for making 
        requests to the applicable Federal agency, for members of the 
        public and other stakeholders to request to adjust the period 
        before such a final peer-reviewed manuscript or published 
        version is made publicly available by presenting evidence 
        demonstrating that the period is inconsistent with the 
        objectives of the Federal research public access policy or the 
        needs of the public, industry, or the scientific community;
            (6) providing research papers as described in paragraph (4)

                productive reuse of the research and computational 
                analysis by state-of-the-art technologies; and
                    (B) examines whether such research papers should 
                include a royalty-free copyright license that is 
                available to the public and that permits the reuse of 
                those research papers, on the condition that 
                attribution is given to the author or authors of the 
                research and any others designated by the copyright 
                owner.
