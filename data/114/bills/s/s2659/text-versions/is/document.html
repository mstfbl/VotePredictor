 To reaffirm that the Environmental Protection Agency cannot regulate 
     vehicles used solely for competition, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Recognizing the Protection of 
Motorsports Act of 2016'' or the ``RPM Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF VEHICLES USED SOLELY FOR COMPETITION FROM THE 
              ANTI-TAMPERING PROVISIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

    Section 203 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7522) is amended by 
adding at the end of subsection (a) the following: ``No action with 
respect to any device or element of design described in paragraph (3) 
shall be treated as a prohibited act under that paragraph if the action 
is for the purpose of modifying a motor vehicle into a vehicle to be 
used solely for competition.''.

SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF VEHICLES USED SOLELY FOR COMPETITION FROM THE 
              DEFINITION OF ``MOTOR VEHICLE'' IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

    Section 216 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7550) is amended by 
striking ``.'' at the end of paragraph (2) and inserting ``and that is 
not a vehicle used solely for competition, including any vehicle so 
used that was converted from a motor vehicle.''.

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION.

    Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall finalize 
any regulations necessary to implement the amendments made by this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
