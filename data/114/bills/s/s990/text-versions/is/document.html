                                 A BILL


 
  To improve the process by which the Librarian of Congress considers 
 requests for exemptions to section 1201(a)(1)(A) of title 17, United 
 States Code, and to ease restrictions on the use of certain statutory 
          exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Breaking Down Barriers to Innovation 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Librarian of Congress (referred to in this section 
        as the ``Librarian'') should ensure that noninfringing uses of 
        copyrighted works, as well as activities unrelated to the 
        copyrighted works, are not unduly burdened by the application 
        of section 1201 of title 17, United States Code;
            (2) the Librarian should apply section 1201 of title 17, 
        United States Code, in a manner that strikes a balance between 
        the ability of persons to make noninfringing use of copyrighted 
        works and the legitimate protection of intellectual property 
        rights;
            (3) the Librarian, in considering whether to grant 
        exemptions to the prohibition on the circumvention of 
        technological protection measures, should recognize that such 
        measures prevent persons from undertaking activities unrelated 
        to the use of copyrighted works; and
            (4) the Librarian--
                    (A) should not impose undue burdens on proponents 
                of exemptions; and
                    (B) should ensure that the rulemaking process for 
                considering exemptions is responsive to changes in the 
                technological landscape.

SEC. 3. CIRCUMVENTION OF COPYRIGHT PROTECTION SYSTEMS.

            (1) In general.--Section 1201(a)(1) of title 17, United

        to the Librarian; and
            ``(ii) may not assign the burden of proof to a proponent of 
        an exemption.
    ``(E) The Librarian, at the discretion of the Librarian, may 
conduct a rulemaking proceeding under subparagraph (C) outside of the 
3-year review process described in that subparagraph if the Librarian 
determines that it is substantially likely that persons who are users 
of a copyrighted work which is in a particular class of works are, or 
are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by 
virtue of the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their ability to 
make noninfringing uses of that particular class of works under this 
title.'';

    ``(iii) At the end of each 3-year period described in subparagraph 
(C), the Librarian shall renew for the ensuing 3-year period each 
exemption granted under subparagraph (C) unless the Librarian 
determines that, as a result of changed circumstances, it is unlikely 
that any persons who are users of a copyrighted work in the class of 
copyrighted works to which the exemption relates will be adversely 
affected by virtue of the prohibition under subparagraph (A) in their 
ability to make noninfringing uses of that particular class of works 
under this title.''; and

        measure that effectively controls access to a work which is in 
        a particular class of copyrighted works diminishes the ability 
        of the persons to make noninfringing uses of that particular 
        class of works under this title;
            ``(ii) if a technological measure inhibits noninfringing 
        uses of a work which is in a particular class of copyrighted 
        works relating to improving accessibility of works or

        presumption that persons who use that particular class of work 
        are likely to be adversely affected; and

        noninfringing based upon the totality of the circumstances, 
        including--
                    ``(I) the presence of supporting judicial 
                precedent;
