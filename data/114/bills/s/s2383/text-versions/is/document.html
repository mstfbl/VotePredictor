SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the testing and development of military weapons systems 
        and the training of military forces are critical to ensuring 
        the national security of the United States;
            (2) the Utah Test and Training Range is a unique and 
        irreplaceable national asset at the core of the test and

            (3) continued access to the special use airspace and land 
        that comprise the Utah Test and Training Range, under the terms 
        and conditions described in this Act is a national security 
        priority;
            (4) multiple use of, sustained yield activities on, and 
        access to the BLM land are vital to the customs, culture, 
        economy, ranching, grazing, and transportation interests of the 
        counties in which the BLM land is situated; and
            (5) the limited use by the military of the BLM land and 
        airspace above the BLM land is vital to improving and 
        maintaining the readiness of the Armed Forces.
