        critical to ensuring the national security of the United 
        States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Utah Test and Training Range is a unique 
        and irreplaceable national asset at the core of the test and 
        training mission of the Department of Defense;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) continued access to the special use airspace 
        and land that comprise the Utah Test and Training Range, under

        security priority;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) multiple use of, sustained yield activities 
        on, and access to the BLM land are vital to the customs, 
        culture, economy, ranching, grazing, and transportation 
        interests of the counties in which the BLM land is situated; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the limited use by the military of the BLM 
        land and airspace above the BLM land is vital to improving and 
        maintaining the readiness of the Armed Forces.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                public, and relevant stakeholders concerning the 
                temporary closure--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) at least 30 days before the 
                        date on which the temporary closure goes into 
                        effect;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the State owns approximately 68,057 acres of 
        land and approximately 10,280 acres of mineral interests 
        located within the Utah Test and Training Range in Box Elder, 
        Tooele, and Juab Counties, Utah;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the State owns approximately 2,353 acres of 
        land and approximately 3,560 acres of mineral interests located 
        wholly or partially within the Cedar Mountains Wilderness in 
        Tooele County, Utah;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the parcels of State land described in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) were granted by Congress to the State 
                pursuant to the Act of July 16, 1894 (28 Stat. 107, 
                chapter 138), to be held in trust for the benefit of 
                the public school system and other public institutions 
                of the State; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) are largely scattered in checkerboard

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) continued State ownership and development of 
        State trust land within the Utah Test and Training Range and

                the Utah Test and Training Range; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the Federal management of the Cedar 
                Mountains Wilderness; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) it is in the public interest of the United 
        States to acquire in a timely manner all State trust land 
        within the Utah Test and Training Range and the Cedar Mountains 
        Wilderness, in exchange for the conveyance of the Federal land 
        to the State, in accordance with the terms and conditions 
        described in this title.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to direct, 
facilitate, and expedite the exchange of certain Federal land and non-
Federal land between the United States and the State.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
