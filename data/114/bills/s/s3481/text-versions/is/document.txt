                                 A BILL


 
  To address payment for claims relating to certain provisions of the 
              Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``HHS Slush Fund Elimination Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Congress, as demonstrated in the Consolidated and 
        Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-
        235; 128 Stat. 2130) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
        2016 (Public Law 114-113; 129 Stat. 2242), does not support the 
        use of taxpayer funding for payments made under the risk 
        corridor program under section 1342 of the Patient Protection 
        and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18062);
            (2) on September 9, 2016, the Department of Health and 
        Human Services issued a memo that encouraged the settlement of 
        civil actions relating to the risk corridor program;
            (3) a 1998 legal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel 
        states ``The Judgment Fund does not become available simply 
        because an agency may have insufficient funds at a particular 
        time to pay a judgment'';
            (4) the Congressional Research Service has concluded that 
        ``the Judgment Fund would not appear to be available to pay for 
        such judgments under current law''; and
            (5) Congress wants to prohibit the Department of Health and 
        Human Services from illegally paying claims or settlements, 
        specifically through the Judgment Fund, to insurers for the 
        risk corridor program.

SEC. 3. JUDGMENTS, AWARDS, AND COMPROMISE SETTLEMENTS.

    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``covered provision'' 
means section 1341 or 1342 of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18061 and 18062).
    (b) Payments.--Notwithstanding section 1304 of title 31, United 
States Code, or any other provision of law--
            (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), no Federal funds, 
        including amounts appropriated under such section 1304, may be 
        used to pay any final judgment, award, or compromise settlement 
        relating to a covered provision (including interest and costs); 
        and
            (2) amounts owed by the United States Government for a 
        final judgment, award, or compromise settlement relating to a 
        covered provision (including interest and costs) shall be paid 
        from amounts appropriated to the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services under section 1342(b)(2) of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18062(b)(2)).
                                 <all>
