SEC. 2. REGULATIONS PROHIBITING THE IMPOSITION OF FEES THAT ARE NOT 
              REASONABLE AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE COSTS INCURRED.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe 
regulations--
            (1) prohibiting an air carrier from imposing fees described 
        in subsection (b) that are unreasonable or disproportional to 
        the costs incurred by the air carrier; and
            (2) establishing standards for assessing whether such fees 
        are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by the 
        air carrier.
    (b) Fees Described.--The fees described in this subsection are--
            (1) any fee for a change or cancellation of a reservation 
        for a flight in interstate air transportation;
            (2) any fee relating to checked baggage to be transported 
        on a flight in interstate air transportation; and
            (3) any other fee imposed by an air carrier relating to a 
        flight in interstate air transportation.
    (c) Considerations.--In establishing the standards required by 
subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall consider--
            (1) with respect to a fee described in subsection (b)(1) 
        imposed by an air carrier for a change or cancellation of a 
        flight reservation--
                    (A) any net benefit or cost to the air carrier from 
                the change or cancellation, taking into consideration--
                            (i) the ability of the air carrier to 
                        anticipate the expected average number of 
                        cancellations and changes and make reservations 
                        accordingly;
                            (ii) the ability of the air carrier to fill 
                        a seat made available by a change or 
                        cancellation;
                            (iii) any difference in the fare likely to 
                        be paid for a ticket sold to another passenger 
                        for a seat made available by the change or 
                        cancellation, as compared to the fare paid by 
                        the passenger who changed or canceled the 
                        passenger's reservation; and
                            (iv) the likelihood that the passenger 
                        changing or canceling the passenger's 
                        reservation will fill a seat on another flight 
                        by the same air carrier;
                    (B) the costs of processing the change or 
                cancellation electronically; and
                    (C) any related labor costs;
            (2) with respect to a fee described in subsection (b)(2) 
        imposed by an air carrier relating to checked baggage--
                    (A) the costs of processing checked baggage 
                electronically; and
                    (B) any related labor costs; and
            (3) any other considerations the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.
    (d) Updated Regulations.--The Secretary shall update the standards 
required by subsection (a)(2) not less frequently than every 3 years.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Air carrier.--The term ``air carrier'' means any air 
        carrier that holds an air carrier certificate under section 
        41101 of title 49, United States Code.
