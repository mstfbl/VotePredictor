                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments 
 of East Rosebud Creek in Carbon County, Montana, as components of the 
                     Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``East Rosebud Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) East Rosebud Creek is cherished by the people of 
        Montana and visitors from across the United States for its 
        clean water, spectacular natural setting, and outstanding 
        recreational opportunities;
            (2) recreational activities, including fishing, hunting, 
        camping, paddling, hiking, rock climbing, and wildlife 
        watching, on East Rosebud Creek and the surrounding land 
        generate millions of dollars annually for the local economy;
            (3) East Rosebud Creek--
                    (A) is a national treasure;
                    (B) possesses outstandingly remarkable values; and
                    (C) merits the high level of protection afforded by 
                the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) 
                in order to maintain the benefits provided by the 
                Creek, as described in paragraphs (1) and (2), for 
                future generations to enjoy; and
            (4) designation of select public land segments of East 
        Rosebud Creek under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 
        1271 et seq.) would recognize the importance of maintaining the 
        values of the Creek while preserving public access, respecting 
        private property rights, allowing appropriate maintenance of 
        existing infrastructure, and allowing historical uses of the 
        Creek to continue.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to designate East Rosebud 
Creek in the State of Montana as a component of the National Wild and 
Scenic Rivers System to preserve and protect for present and future 
generations the outstandingly remarkable scenic, recreational, and 
geologic values of the Creek.

SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF WILD AND SCENIC RIVER SEGMENTS.

    Section
     (a) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(213) East rosebud creek, montana.--The portions of East 
        Rosebud Creek in the State of Montana, consisting of--
                    ``(A) the 13-mile segment exclusively on public 
                land within the Custer National Forest from the source 
                in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness downstream to the 
                point at which the Creek enters East Rosebud Lake, 
                including the stream reach between Twin Outlets Lake 
                and Fossil Lake, to be administered by the Secretary of 
                Agriculture as a wild river; and
                    ``(B) the 7-mile segment exclusively on public land 
                within the Custer National Forest from immediately 
                below, but not including, the outlet of East Rosebud 
                Lake downstream to the point at which the Creek enters 
                private property for the first time, to be administered 
                by the Secretary of Agriculture as a recreational 
                river.''.
    (b) Adjacent Management.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in paragraph (213) of section 3(a) 
        of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) (as added 
        by subsection (a)) creates a protective perimeter or buffer 
        zone outside the designated boundary of the river segment 
        designated by that paragraph.
            (2) Outside activities.--The fact that an otherwise 
        authorized activity or use can be seen or heard within the 
        boundary of the river segment designated by paragraph (213) of 
        section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 
        1274(a)) (as added by subsection (a)) shall not preclude the 
        activity or use outside the boundary of the river segment.
