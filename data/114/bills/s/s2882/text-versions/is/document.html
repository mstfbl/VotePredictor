            (1) In general.--The 2015 ozone standards shall not apply 
        to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit 
        application if--
                    (A) the Administrator or the State, local, or 
                tribal permitting authority, as applicable, determines 
                the application to be complete on or before the date of
