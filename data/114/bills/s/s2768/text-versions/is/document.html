                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to update a program to 
   provide assistance for the planning, design, and construction of 
 treatment works to intercept, transport, control, or treat municipal 
 combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows, and to require 
  the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to update 
certain guidance used to develop and determine the financial capability 
    of communities to implement clean water infrastructure programs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Water Affordability Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
            (2) Infiltration.--The term ``infiltration'' means the 
        process by which stormwater enters a sanitary sewer system 
        through broken pipes or defective pipe joints.
            (3) Inflow.--The term ``inflow'' means the process by which 
        stormwater enters a sanitary sewer system through inappropriate 
        pipe connections.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
        et seq.) has--
                    (A) resulted in improved water quality, habitat 
                restoration, and the protection of public health; and
                    (B) proven effective for managing municipal 
                wastewater flows under most weather conditions, 
                however, during heavy precipitation events, wastewater 
                flows to a municipal sanitary or combined sewer system 
                can overload the system, overwhelm treatment plant 
                processes, and lead to sewer overflows.
            (2) There are approximately 15,800 municipal sanitary sewer 
        systems, 770 municipal combined sewer systems, and 5,000 
        satellite collection systems that convey wastewater through 
        municipal sewer systems for treatment at publicly owned 
        treatment works.
            (3) In December 1999, Congress incorporated the national 
        Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency into section 402(q) of the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342(q)), codifying framework 
        to manage wet weather events that overwhelm combined sewer 
        systems.
            (4) No other framework similar to the framework described 
        in paragraph (3) has been established for managing wet weather-
        related challenges at municipal sanitary sewer systems.
            (5) Municipal sanitary sewer systems can experience flows 
        exceeding the capacity of those sewer systems during periods in 
        which stormwater enters the system by infiltration and inflow.
            (6) The Administrator estimates that--
                    (A) more than $8,000,000,000 is needed to correct 
                infiltration and inflow throughout the United States 
                with no expectation that overflows will be eliminated;
                    (B) more than $290,000,000,000 is needed to address 
                general wastewater and stormwater management needs at 
                the municipal level over the next 20 years; and
                    (C) $335,000,000,000 of community investment is 
                needed to address drinking water needs.
            (7) The Director of the Bureau of the Census estimates that 
        municipalities spend more than $90,000,000,000 annually on 
        water and wastewater infrastructure, an amount that is second 
        only to education as a municipal budget item and greater than 
        amounts spent on roads, hospitals, police, and other essential 
        services.
            (8) Affordable treatment and management techniques are 
        available to help municipalities manage wet weather-related 
        flows affordably and cost-effectively while ensuring the 
        protection of the environment and public health.
            (9) Many communities have used wet weather wastewater 
        management techniques for decades with the approval of the 
        Administrator and Federal and State funding through grants or 
        loans.
            (10) The added challenge of extreme weather 
        unpredictability will increasingly result in--
                    (A) communities facing both intensive precipitation 
                events that will overwhelm sewer systems;
                    (B) unwanted system overflows; and
                    (C) more intensive droughts that render the more 
                costly treatment techniques a stranding of scarce 
                resources for marginal environmental benefits.
            (11) The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
        1251 et seq.) may provide more cost-effective tools--
                    (A) to accelerate the elimination of combined 
                sewage overflows;
                    (B) to incentivize better planning for heavy 
                precipitation events;
                    (C) to enable alternative treatment and management 
                techniques that protect the environment and public 
                health; and
                    (D) to provide for better overall cost-effective 
                management of wet weather flows.

SEC. 11. UPDATING OF GUIDANCE.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Affordability.--The term ``affordability'' means, with 
        respect to payment of a utility bill, a measure of whether an 
        individual customer or household can pay the bill without undue 
        hardship or unreasonable sacrifice in the essential lifestyle 
        or spending patterns of the individual or household, as 
        determined by the Administrator.
            (2) Financial capability.--The term ``financial 
        capability'' means the financial capability of a community to 
        make investments necessary to make water quality-related 
        improvements, taking into consideration the criteria described 
        in subsection (b)(2)(A).
            (3) Guidance.--The term ``guidance'' means the guidance 
        published by the Administrator entitled ``Combined Sewer 
        Overflows--Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and 
        Schedule Development'' and dated February 1997, as applicable 
        to combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.
    (b) Updating.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall update the 
        guidance to ensure that the evaluations by the Administrator of 
        financial capability assessment and schedule development meet 
        the criteria described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Criteria.--The criteria described in this paragraph are 
        that, under the updated guidance--
                    (A) in assessing financial capability of a 
                community--
                            (i) greater emphasis should be placed on 
                        local economic conditions;
                            (ii) for regional systems, consideration 
                        should be given to the economic conditions of 
                        political jurisdictions and significant 
                        demographic groups within each region;
                            (iii) prescriptive formulas for use in 
                        calculating financial capability and thresholds 
                        for expenditure should not be considered to be 
                        the only indicator of the financial capability 
                        of a community;
                            (iv) site-specific local conditions should 
                        be taken into consideration in analyzing 
                        financial capability;
                            (v) a single measure of financial 
                        capability or affordability (such as median 
                        household income) should be viewed in the 
                        context of other economic measures, rather than 
                        as a threshold to be achieved; and
                            (vi)(I) consideration should be given to 
                        the economic outlook of a community, including 
                        the potential impact of program requirements 
                        over time, in the development of implementation 
                        schedules; and
                            (II) the assessment should take into 
                        consideration other essential community 
                        investments relating to water quality 
                        improvements;
                    (B) with respect to the timing of implementation of 
                water quality-related improvements--
                            (i) environmental improvement 
                        implementation schedules should be structured 
                        to mitigate the potential adverse impact on 
                        distressed populations resulting from the costs 
                        of the improvements; and
                            (ii) implementation schedules should--
                                    (I) reflect local community 
                                financial conditions and economic 
                                impacts; and
                                    (II) give appropriate weight to the 
                                economic, public health, and 
                                environmental benefits associated with 
                                improved water quality;
                    (C) with respect to implementation of 
                methodologies--
                            (i) a determination of local financial 
                        capability may be achieved through an 
                        evaluation of an array of factors the relative 
                        importance of which may vary across regions and 
                        localities; and
                            (ii) an appropriate methodology should give 
                        consideration to such various factors as are 
                        appropriate to recognize the prevailing and 
                        projected economic concerns in a community; and
                    (D) the residential indicator should be revised to 
                include--
                            (i) a consideration of costs imposed upon 
                        ratepayers for essential utilities;
                            (ii) increased consideration and 
                        quantification of local community-imposed costs 
                        in regional systems;
                            (iii) a mechanism to assess impacts on 
                        communities with disparate economic conditions 
                        throughout the entire service area of a 
                        utility;
                            (iv) a consideration of the industrial and 
                        population trends of a community;
                            (v) recognition that--
                                    (I) the median household income of 
                                a service area reflects a numerical 
                                median rather than the distribution of 
                                incomes within the service area; and
                                    (II) more representative methods of 
                                determining affordability, such as 
                                shelter costs, essential utility 
                                payments, and State and local tax 
                                efforts, should be considered;
                            (vi) cash-flow forecasting rather than 
                        forecasting based on a snapshot evaluation of 
                        community financial capability;
                            (vii) a consideration of low-income 
                        ratepayer percentages; and
                            (viii) impacts relating to program 
                        delivery, such as water quality infrastructure 
                        market saturation and program management.
            (3) Implementation.--The updated guidance should indicate 
        that, in a case in which a previously approved long-term 
        control plan or associated enforceable agreement allows for 
        modification of the plan or terms of the agreement (including 
        financial capability considerations), and all parties are in 
        agreement that a change is needed or that the plan or agreement 
        contains a reopener provision to address changes in the 
        economic or financial status of the community since the 
        effective date of the plan or agreement, reconsideration and 
        modification of financial capability determinations and 
        implementation schedules based on the criteria described in 
        paragraph (2) are appropriate.
    (c) Publication and Submission.--Upon completion of the updating of 
guidance under subsection (b), the Administrator shall publish in the 
Federal Register and submit to the Committee on Environment and Public 
Works of the Senate and the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure of the House of Representatives the updated guidance.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out this section.
