SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of General Services.
            (2) Baseline.--The term ``baseline'' means the highest 
        annual rate of energy use for a building during the period 
        beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31 of the 
        calendar year preceding the calendar year during which the deep 
        energy retrofit of the building commenced.
            (3) Deep energy retrofit.--The term ``deep energy 
        retrofit'' means a project carried out in a Federal building 
        that results in energy savings in that building of at least 35 
        percent, and preferably at least 50 percent, relative to the

            (4) Energy savings.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``energy savings'' means 
                the quantity of energy calculated on an annual basis 
                and equal to the difference between--
                            (i) the quantity of energy used in a 
                        Federal building after a deep energy retrofit; 
                        and
                            (ii) the baseline for the building.
                    (B) Calculation.--For purposes of calculating 
                energy savings under subparagraph (A)--
                            (i) calculations shall be made for 
                        electricity separately than other fuels;
                            (ii) conversions from electricity to 
                        British thermal units may be permitted; and
                            (iii) the baseline and deep retrofit 
                        building consumption data shall be adjusted for 
                        any differences in weather, occupancy, and 
                        other important usage indicators.
            (5) Federal building.--The term ``Federal building'' means 
        a building owned by a Federal agency.
            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Energy.

SEC. 2. DEEP ENERGY RETROFIT PROGRAM.

    (a) Planning.--
            (1) Development.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary

                building shall submit to the Secretary and the 
                Administrator a plan for deep energy retrofits of at 
                least 50 percent of the Federal buildings of the 
                agency.
                    (B) Technical assistance.--The Secretary, acting 
                through the Federal Energy Management Program and in 
                cooperation with the Administrator, shall provide 
                technical assistance to each Federal agency to carry 
                out subparagraph (A).
