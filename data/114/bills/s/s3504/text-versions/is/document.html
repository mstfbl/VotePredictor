                provide incentive payments to such beneficiaries who 
                are furnished qualifying services in accordance with

SEC. 502. GAO STUDY AND REPORT ON LONGITUDINAL COMPREHENSIVE CARE 
              PLANNING SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE PART B.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a study on the 
establishment under part B of the Medicare program under title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act of a payment code for a visit for longitudinal 
comprehensive care planning services. Such study shall include an 
analysis of the following to the extent such information is available:
            (1) The frequency with which services similar to 
        longitudinal comprehensive care planning services are furnished 
        to Medicare beneficiaries, which providers of services and 
        suppliers are furnishing those services, whether Medicare 
        reimbursement is being received for those services, and, if so, 
        through which codes those services are being reimbursed.
            (2) Whether, and the extent to which, longitudinal 
        comprehensive care planning services would overlap, and could 
        therefore result in duplicative payment, with services covered 
        under the hospice benefit as well as the chronic care 
        management code, evaluation and management codes, or other 
        codes that already exist under part B of the Medicare program.
            (3) Any barriers to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, 
        hospice programs, home health agencies, and other applicable 
        providers working with a Medicare beneficiary to engage in the 
        care planning process and complete the necessary documentation 
        to support the treatment and care plan of the beneficiary and 
        provide such documentation to other providers and the 
        beneficiary or his representative.
            (4) Any barriers to providers, other than the provider 
        furnishing longitudinal comprehensive care planning services, 
        accessing the care plan and associated documentation for use 
        related to the care of the Medicare beneficiary.
            (5) Potential options for ensuring that applicable 
        providers are notified of a patient's existing longitudinal 
        care plan and that applicable providers consider that plan in 
        making their treatment decisions, and what the challenges might 
        be in implementing such options.
            (6) Stakeholder's views on the need for the development of 
        quality metrics with respect to longitudinal comprehensive care 
        planning services, such as measures related to--
                    (A) the process of eliciting input from the 
                Medicare beneficiary or from a legally authorized 
                representative and documenting in the medical record 
                the patient-directed care plan;
                    (B) the effectiveness and patient-centeredness of 
                the care plan in organizing delivery of services 
                consistent with the plan;
                    (C) the availability of the care plan and 
                associated documentation to other providers that care 
                for the beneficiary; and
                    (D) the extent to which the beneficiary received 
                services and support that is free from discrimination 
                based on advanced age, disability status, or advanced 
                illness.
            (7) Stakeholder's views on how such quality metrics would 
        provide information on--
                    (A) the goals, values, and preferences of the 
                beneficiary;
                    (B) the documentation of the care plan;
                    (C) services furnished to the beneficiary; and
                    (D) outcomes of treatment.
            (8) Stakeholder's views on--
                    (A) the type of training and education needed for 
                applicable providers, individuals, and caregivers in 
                order to facilitate longitudinal comprehensive care 
                planning services;
                    (B) the types of providers of services and 
                suppliers that should be included in the 
                interdisciplinary team of an applicable provider; and
                    (C) the characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries 
                that would be most appropriate to receive longitudinal 
                comprehensive care planning services, such as 
                individuals with advanced disease and individuals who

        conjunction with the receipt of other items or services, such 
        as behavioral counseling, and how these compare to items and

        have on medical services that are directly related to obesity, 
        including with respect to subpopulations determined based on 
        the extent of obesity.
            (10) What is known about the spending associated with the
