        the allotment, all public institutions of higher education in 
        the State will not increase tuition for in-State students by a 
        percentage greater than the estimated percentage increase in 
        the Consumer Price Index (as determined by the Secretary, using 
        the definition in section 478(f)) for the calendar year for 
        which the State is receiving the allotment.
    ``(d) Authority to Compromise.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) and 
(c), the Secretary may waive any maintenance of support and effort 
requirement described in such subsections for a State if there is a 
clear case of a significant economic downturn in the State as evidenced 
by a reduction in State domestic product, real per capita income, and 
employment. Such determination shall only be made by the Secretary 
following a written appeal by the State that documents recent and 
significant decreases in economic activity in the State.
