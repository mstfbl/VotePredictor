                                 A BILL


 
 To advance the integration of clean distributed energy into electric 
                     grids, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Distributed Energy Grid 
Integration Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) research by the Secretary of Energy and the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has found 
        that clean distributed energy technologies can create important 
        values for both the host facility and the electric grid 
        operator;
            (2) the values described in paragraph (1) can include, for 
        the host facility--
                    (A) energy bill savings;
                    (B) additional revenue from offering ancillary 
                services to the electric grid operator;
                    (C) increased electric reliability in the event of 
                grid outages; and
                    (D) improved electric power quality;
            (3) the values described in paragraph (1) can include, for 
        the electric grid operator--
                    (A) avoiding the need for transmission and 
                distribution upgrade investments;
                    (B) enhanced grid stability by providing reactive 
                power;
                    (C) voltage and frequency stabilization; and
                    (D) more reliable and stable operation of the grid 
                by providing dispatchable energy to the grid during 
                periods of insufficient capacity or supply; and
            (4) new advances in intelligent sensing and simulation and 
        control technologies offer the potential to enhance the 
        benefits of clean distributed generation to both the host 
        facility and the electric grid operator from dynamic, adaptive, 
        and anticipatory response to changing grid conditions.
