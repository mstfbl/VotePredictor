    (a) Summary Nutrition Labeling Information.--
            (1) In general.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end 
        the following new paragraph:
    ``(z)(1) Except as provided in subparagraphs (3), (4), and (5) of 
paragraph (q), if it is food (other than a dietary supplement) intended 
for human consumption and is offered for sale and otherwise required to 
bear nutrition labeling, unless its principal display panel bears 
summary nutrition information that reflects the overall nutritional 
value of the food or specified ingredients, as specified in accordance 
with regulations of the Secretary, and does not contain any summary 
nutritional information which is in addition to or inconsistent with 
the information required under this subparagraph.''.
            (2) Principles for implementing regulations.--In 
        promulgating regulations regarding the summary nutrition 
        information required under the amendment made by paragraph (1), 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take into 
        account published reports of the Institute of Medicine of the 
        National Academy of Sciences regarding such information and 
        base regulations on the following principles:
                    (A) There should be a single simple, standard 
                symbol system that displays calorie information related 
                to a common serving size, and information related to 
                nutrients strongly associated with public health 
                concerns.
                    (B) Consumers should be able to quickly and easily 
                comprehend the meaning of the symbol system as an 
                indicator of a product's contribution to a healthy 
                diet.
                    (C) The information should appear on all products 
                that are required to bear nutrition labeling.
                    (D) The information should--
                            (i) appear in a consistent location on the 
                        principal display panels across products;
                            (ii) have a prominent design that visually 
                        contrasts with existing packaging design; and
                            (iii) be sufficiently large to be easily 
                        legible.
                    (E) The nutrition information should be consistent 
                with the Nutrition Facts Panel and with the 
                recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines of Americans.
                    (F) The information should aim to facilitate 
                consumer selection of healthy product options, 
                including among nutritionally at-risk subpopulations.
                    (G) The Secretary should periodically evaluate the 
                front-of-package information to assess its ability to 
                help facilitate consumer selection of healthy product 
                options and the extent to which manufacturers are 
                offering healthier products as a result of the 
                disclosure.
                    (H) The implementation of the information 
                disclosure should be accompanied by appropriate 
                consumer education and promotion campaigns determined 
                by the Secretary.
    (b) Percentage of Wheat and Grains in Grain-Based Products.--
Section 403(z) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
343(z)), as added by subsection (a)(1), is further amended by adding at 
the end the following new subparagraph:
            ``(2) If, in the case of food other than a dietary 
        supplement, the principal display panel bears--
                    ``(A) the phrase `made with whole grain', the term 
                `multigrain', or similar descriptive phrases, terms, or 
                representations with respect to whole grain content, 
                unless the amount of whole grains, expressed as a 
                percentage of total grains, is conspicuously disclosed 
                in immediate proximity to such descriptive phrase, 
                term, or representation; or
                    ``(B) the terms `wheat' or `whole wheat' on breads, 
                pasta, crackers, or similar wheat-based products, 
                unless the percentage of whole wheat by weight 
                contained in the food is conspicuously declared in 
                immediate proximity to that term or there is a 
                conspicuous declaration that the food `contains no 
                whole wheat' in immediate proximity to that term.''.
    (c) Sweeteners, Coloring, and Flavoring.--Section 403(z) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(z)), as amended, is 
further amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
            ``(3) If, in the case of food other than a dietary 
        supplement, it bears or contains any added artificial or 
        natural coloring, any added artificial or natural non-caloric 
        sweetener, or any added artificial or natural flavoring, unless 
        such fact is prominently stated on the principal display panel 
        of a package or container of the food.''.
    (d) Conforming Amendment.--The second sentence of section 403(k) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(k)) is amended 
by striking ``and (i)'' and inserting ``, (i), and (z)''.
    (e) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
affecting any requirement in regulation in effect as of the date of the 
enactment of this Act with respect to matters that are required to be 
stated on the principal display panel of a package or container of food 
that is not required by an amendment made by this section or as 
restricting the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to require additional information be disclosed on such a principal 
display panel.

                application of section 403(r) of the Federal Food, 
                Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)) with respect 
                to the mechanisms by which a nutrient in food (other 
                than a dietary supplement) is intended to affect the 
                structure or any function of the human body, or 
                characterize the documented mechanism by which a 
                nutrient in such food acts to maintain such structure 
                or function; and
                    (B) issue guidance clarifying the application of 
                such section 403(r) with respect to the substantiation 
                of claims pursuant to a request under section 403(r)(7)

                following:
            ``(7) If the Secretary requests that a claim under 
        subparagraph (1)(B) for food (other than a dietary supplement) 
        be substantiated, then not later than 90 days after the date on 
        which the Secretary makes such request, the manufacturer shall 
        provide to the Secretary all documentation in the 
        manufacturer's possession relating to the claim.''.
    (b) Trans Fats.--Section 403(r)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)(A)) is amended--
            (1) in subclause (iii)--
                    (A) in the matter before item (I), by striking 
                ``fat or saturated fat'' and inserting ``fat, saturated 
                fat, or trans fats''; and
                    (B) in item (II), by striking ``fat or saturated

            (4) by inserting after subclause (iv) the following new 
        subclause:
            ``(v) may not be made with respect to the level of trans 
        fats in the food unless the food contains less than one gram of 
        saturated fat per serving or, if the food contains more than 
        one gram of saturated fat per serving, unless the label or 
        labeling of the food discloses the level of saturated fat in 
        the food in immediate proximity to such claim and with 
        appropriate prominence which shall be no less than one-half the 
        size of the claim with respect to the level of trans fats,''.

                    (B) including provisions to specifically address 
                the use of such term on the principal display panel and 
                the information panel.
            (2) Definition.--The rule promulgated pursuant to paragraph 
        (1) shall define the term ``natural''--
                    (A) to exclude, at a minimum, the use of any 
                artificial food or ingredient (including any artificial 
                flavor or added color) or any synthetic substance; and
                    (B) based on data, including data on consumers' 
                understanding of the term as used in connection with 
                food.
            (3) Process.--In promulgating the rule required by

                consumer understanding of the term ``natural'' in 
                relation to the term ``organic''; and
                    (B) fully consider the results of such surveys and 
                studies, as well as such public submissions.
    (b) Use of Term ``Healthy''.--
            (1) Added sugars and whole grains.--The Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services shall revise the regulations under the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to the use of the 
        term ``healthy'' on the labeling of a food (other than a 
        dietary supplement) to take into account the extent to which 
        such food contains added sugars or whole grains.
            (2) Requirements.--In making the revisions to regulations 
        required by paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in the case of a food (other than a dietary 
                supplement) that contains grains, the Secretary shall 
                not consider the food to be ``healthy'' unless at least 
                half of those grains, by weight, are whole grains; and
                    (B) the Secretary shall not allow a food to be 
                labeled ``healthy'' if the food contains more than 10 
                percent of the daily value of added sugar per serving 
                as determined by the Secretary under section
