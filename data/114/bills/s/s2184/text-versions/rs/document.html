&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Objectives of Guidelines.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The guidelines established

                results;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to develop specific project monitoring 
                and evaluation plans, including measurable goals and 
                performance metrics, and to identify the resources

                evaluation methodologies to such programs, including 
                through the use of impact evaluations, ex-post

                clearly define program logic, inputs, outputs, 
                intermediate outcomes, and end outcomes;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) to disseminate guidelines for the 
                development and implementation of monitoring and

                pilot programs before replicating wherever possible, or 
                provide a written justification for not conducting an

                lessons learned that serve as benchmarks to guide 
                future programs for United States development 
                professionals, implementing partners, the donor 
                community, and aid recipient governments, and as a 
                repository of knowledge on lessons learned;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                of the evaluation;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (K) to undertake collaborative 
                partnerships and coordinate efforts with the academic 
                community, implementing partners, and national and 
                international institutions that have expertise in 
                program monitoring, evaluation, and analysis when such 
                partnerships provide needed expertise or significantly 
                improve the evaluation and analysis;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (L) to ensure verifiable, valid, credible, 
                precise, reliable, and timely data are available to

                agency makes a determination that the inclusion of a 
                required item of information online would jeopardize 
                the health or security of an implementing partner or

                proprietary information of an implementing partner or 
                program beneficiary, the head of the Federal department 
                or agency shall provide such determination in writing 
                to the appropriate congressional committees, including

                        appropriate congressional committees on such 
                        information; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) submit such information to 
                        the appropriate congressional committees in a 
                        written report.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                states.--If the Secretary of State makes a 
                determination that the inclusion of a required item of 
                information online would be detrimental to the national 
                interests of the United States, the Secretary of State 
                shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) provide such determination, 
                        including the basis for such determination, in 
                        writing to the appropriate congressional 
                        committees; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
