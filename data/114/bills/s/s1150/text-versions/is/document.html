        as follows:
            ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not 
        less than--
                    ``(A) $8.00 an hour, beginning on January 1, 2016, 
                or the first day of the third month that begins after 
                the date of enactment of the Raise the Wage Act, 
                whichever date is later;
                    ``(B) $9.00 an hour, beginning 1 year after the 
                date the wage specified in subparagraph (A) takes 
                effect;
                    ``(C) $10.00 an hour, beginning 2 years after such 
                date;
                    ``(D) $11.00 an hour, beginning 3 years after such 
                date;
                    ``(E) $12.00 an hour, beginning 4 years after such 
                date; and
                    ``(F) beginning on the date that is 5 years after 
                such date, and annually thereafter, the amount 
                determined by the Secretary pursuant to subsection 
                (h);''.
            (2) Determination based on increase in the median hourly 
        wage of all employees.--Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards 
        Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:
    ``(h)(1) Each year, by not later than the date that is 90 days 
before a new minimum wage determined under subsection (a)(1)(F) is to 
take effect, the Secretary shall determine the minimum wage to be in 
effect pursuant to this subsection for each period described in 
subsection (a)(1)(F). The wage determined pursuant to this subsection 
for a year shall be--
            ``(A) not less than the amount in effect under subsection 
        (a)(1) on the date of such determination;
            ``(B) increased from such amount by the annual percentage 
        increase in the median hourly wage of all employees as 
        determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and
            ``(C) rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05.
    ``(2) In calculating the annual percentage increase in the median 
hourly wage of all employees for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the 
Secretary through the Bureau of Labor Statistics shall compile data on 
the hourly wages of all employees to determine such a median hourly 
wage and compare such median hourly wage for the most recent year for 
which data are available with the median hourly wage determined for the 
preceding year.''.
    (b) Base Minimum Wage for Tipped Employees.--Section 3(m)(1) of the 
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(m)(1)) is amended to

        of such determination shall be not less than--
                    ``(A) for the 1-year period beginning on January 1, 
                2016, or the first day of the third month that begins 
                after the date of enactment of the Raise the Wage Act, 
                whichever date is later, $3.15 an hour;
                    ``(B) for each succeeding 1-year period until the 
                hourly wage under this paragraph equals the wage in 
                effect under section 6(a)(1) for such period, an hourly 
                wage equal to the amount determined under this 
                paragraph for the preceding year, increased by the 
                lesser of--
                            ``(i) $1.05; or
                            ``(ii) the amount necessary for the wage in 
                        effect under this paragraph to equal the wage 
                        in effect under section 6(a)(1) for such 
                        period, rounded to the nearest multiple of 
                        $0.05; and
                    ``(C) for each succeeding 1-year period after the 
                year in which the hourly wage under this paragraph 
                first equals the wage in effect under section 6(a)(1) 
                for the same period, the amount necessary to ensure 
                that the wage in effect under this paragraph remains 
                equal to the wage in effect under section 6(a)(1), 
                rounded to the nearest multiple of $0.05; and''.
