SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The nature of genocide and mass atrocities, including 
        crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes, 
        committed globally includes shocking acts of violence 
        perpetrated by governments and non-state actors, which have 
        killed millions of civilians and other innocent individuals.
            (2) The commitment to prevent acts of genocide and mass 
        atrocities has been a centerpiece of policy by consecutive 
        administrations of the United States Government.
            (3) The United States was the first country in the world to 
        sign the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
        Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris December 9, 1948, and 
        President Ronald Reagan signed implementing legislation 
        allowing the United States to become a party to the Convention 
        on November 25, 1988.
            (4) In the 2006 National Security Strategy, President 
        George W. Bush highlighted the ``moral imperative that states 
        take action to prevent and punish genocide''.
            (5) In 2008, the bipartisan Genocide Prevention Task Force, 
        which was co-chaired by former Secretary of Defense William 
        Cohen and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright--
                    (A) stated ``genocide and mass atrocities also 
                threaten core U.S. national interests''; and
                    (B) recommended the creation of ``a new standing 
                interagency mechanism for analysis of threats [of 
                genocide and mass atrocities] and coordination of 
                appropriate preventive action''.
            (6) In December 2010, the Senate unanimously passed Senate 
        Concurrent Resolution 71, which recognized the United States 
        ``national interest in helping to prevent and mitigate acts of 
        genocide and other mass atrocities against civilians, and 
        supporting and encouraging efforts to develop a whole of 
        government approach to prevent and mitigate such acts''.
            (7) In 2012, President Obama, in Presidential Study 
        Directive 10, which ordered the creation of the Atrocities 
        Prevention Board, stated that he would ensure that the United 
        States Government has the required structures, tools, and 
        mechanisms to better prevent and respond to mass atrocities.
            (8) In February 2014, James Clapper, the Director of 
        National Intelligence, stated in his annual national security 
        threat assessment to Congress--
                    (A) ``The overall risk of mass atrocities worldwide 
                will probably increase in 2014 and beyond.'';
                    (B) ``Many countries at risk of mass atrocities 
                will likely be open to influence to prevent or mitigate 
                them.''; and
                    (C) ``Much of the world will almost certainly turn 
                to the United States for leadership to prevent and 
                respond to mass atrocities.''.
            (9) The United States can strengthen its atrocity 
        prevention and peacebuilding efforts by--
                    (A) supporting civil society which serves a central 
                role in promoting nonviolent conflict resolution and 
                supporting early warning;
                    (B) enhancing cooperation and understanding among 
                ethnic and religious groups, communities, and factions;
                    (C) working with the international community to 
                ensure shared responsibility by enhancing multilateral 
                and regional mechanisms that seek to prevent genocide 
                and mass atrocities;
                    (D) promoting effective accountability mechanisms 
                to deter individuals and entities that may incite or 
                commit genocide or mass atrocities; and
                    (E) implementing policies that hold accountable 
                individuals and entities that incite or commit genocide 
                or mass atrocities.
