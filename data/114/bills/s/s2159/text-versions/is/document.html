                physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness 
                that would, as certified by a physician, place the 
                woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
                performed, including a life-endangering physical 
                condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
                itself.
            ``(3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        terms `institution', `agency', or `entity' mean the entire 
        legal institution, agency, or entity, or any part thereof, 
        including any institution, agency, or entity that controls, is
