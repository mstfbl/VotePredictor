  To improve certain programs of the Small Business Administration to 
     better assist small business customers in accessing broadband 
                  technology, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Broadband 
and Emerging Information Technology Enhancement Act of 
2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) According to a report by the Federal 
        Communications Commission entitled ``Connecting America: The 
        National Broadband Plan'', dated March 2010, the Commission 
        recommends that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) ``To fully implement next-generation 
                technology within its operations, the SBA should also 
                appoint a broadband and emerging IT coordinator. This 
                individual would ensure that SBA programs maintain the 
                requisite broadband expertise, tools and training 
                courses to serve small businesses.'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) ``Congress should consider ways to 
                leverage existing assistance provided through'' 
                entrepreneurial development programs, ``to focus 
                training on advanced IT and broadband 
                applications'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) ``Congress could also consider ways to 
                support technology training among women entrepreneurs 
                through'' women's business centers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) ``The training programs should include 
                an entry-level `Broadband 101' course to give small 
                businesses an introduction to how to capitalize on 
                broadband connectivity, as well as more advanced 
                applications for IT staff.''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) small and medium enterprise ``IT 
                training should include resources for non-IT staff, 
                such as how to use e-commerce tools for sales, 
                streamline finance with online records or leverage 
                knowledge management across an 
                organization.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) According to a report by the Broadband 
        Opportunity Council, dated August 20, 2015, the Council 
        recommends that the United States--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) modernize Federal programs to expand 
                program support for broadband technology 
                investments;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) empower communities with tools and 
                resources to attract investment in and promote 
                meaningful use of broadband technology;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) promote increased deployment of and 
                competition relating to broadband technology through 
                expanded access to Federal assets; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) improve data collection, analysis, and 
                research on broadband technology.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) According to a report entitled ``The State of 
        the App Economy'', dated October 2014--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) ``More than three-quarters of the 
                highest grossing apps are produced by startups and 
                small companies.''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) ``Seventy-eight percent of the leading 
                app companies are located outside Silicon 
                Valley.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) According to a report entitled, ``Developer 
        Economics Q1 2015: State of the Developer Nation'', dated 
        February 2015, ``The emergence of the app industry over the 
        past eight years has grown to a $120 billion 
        economy.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Broadband and 
Emerging Information Technology Enhancement Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a report by the Federal Communications 
        Commission entitled ``Connecting America: The National 
        Broadband Plan'', dated March 2010, the Commission recommends 
        that--
                    (A) ``To fully implement next-generation technology 
                within its operations, the SBA should also appoint a 
                broadband and emerging IT coordinator. This individual 
                would ensure that SBA programs maintain the requisite 
                broadband expertise, tools and training courses to 
                serve small businesses.'';
                    (B) ``Congress should consider ways to leverage 
                existing assistance provided through'' entrepreneurial 
                development programs, ``to focus training on advanced 
                IT and broadband applications'';
                    (C) ``Congress could also consider ways to support 
                technology training among women entrepreneurs through'' 
                women's business centers;
                    (D) ``The training programs should include an 
                entry-level `Broadband 101' course to give small 
                businesses an introduction to how to capitalize on 
                broadband connectivity, as well as more advanced 
                applications for IT staff.''; and
                    (E) small and medium enterprise ``IT training 
                should include resources for non-IT staff, such as how 
                to use e-commerce tools for sales, streamline finance 
                with online records or leverage knowledge management 
                across an organization.''.
            (2) According to a report by the Broadband Opportunity 
        Council, dated August 20, 2015, the availability of and access 
        to broadband technology enables--
                    (A) greater civic participation, by providing tools 
                for open government and streamlining government 
                process;
                    (B) changes in how people access educational 
                resources, collaborate in the educational process, 
                conduct research, and continue to learn anytime, 
                anyplace, and at any pace;
                    (C) improved healthcare access, treatments, and 
                information;
                    (D) new business models that create business 
                efficiencies, drive job creation, and connect 
                manufacturers and store-fronts to clients and partners 
                worldwide; and
                    (E) bringing communities together and improvements 
                to public safety, creating a greener planet, and make 
                transportation systems more resilient and efficient.
            (3) According to a report entitled ``The State of the App 
        Economy'', dated October 2014--
                    (A) ``More than three-quarters of the highest 
                grossing apps are produced by startups and small 
                companies.''; and
                    (B) ``Seventy-eight percent of the leading app 
                companies are located outside Silicon Valley.''.
            (4) According to a report entitled, ``Developer Economics 
        Q1 2015: State of the Developer Nation'', dated February 2015, 
        ``The emergence of the app industry over the past eight years
