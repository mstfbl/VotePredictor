SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a report by the Federal Communications 
        Commission entitled ``Connecting America: The National 
        Broadband Plan'', dated March 2010, the Commission recommends 
        that--
                    (A) ``To fully implement next-generation technology 
                within its operations, the SBA should also appoint a 
                broadband and emerging IT coordinator. This individual 
                would ensure that SBA programs maintain the requisite 
                broadband expertise, tools and training courses to 
                serve small businesses.'';
                    (B) ``Congress should consider ways to leverage 
                existing assistance provided through'' entrepreneurial 
                development programs, ``to focus training on advanced 
                IT and broadband applications'';
                    (C) ``Congress could also consider ways to support 
                technology training among women entrepreneurs through'' 
                women's business centers;
                    (D) ``The training programs should include an 
                entry-level `Broadband 101' course to give small 
                businesses an introduction to how to capitalize on 
                broadband connectivity, as well as more advanced 
                applications for IT staff.''; and
                    (E) small and medium enterprise ``IT training 
                should include resources for non-IT staff, such as how 
                to use e-commerce tools for sales, streamline finance 
                with online records or leverage knowledge management 
                across an organization.''.
            (2) According to a report by the Broadband Opportunity 
        Council, dated August 20, 2015, the Council recommends that the 
        United States--
                    (A) modernize Federal programs to expand program 
                support for broadband technology investments;
                    (B) empower communities with tools and resources to 
                attract investment in and promote meaningful use of 
                broadband technology;
                    (C) promote increased deployment of and competition 
                relating to broadband technology through expanded 
                access to Federal assets; and
                    (D) improve data collection, analysis, and research 
                on broadband technology.
            (3) According to a report entitled ``The State of the App 
        Economy'', dated October 2014--
                    (A) ``More than three-quarters of the highest 
                grossing apps are produced by startups and small 
                companies.''; and
                    (B) ``Seventy-eight percent of the leading app 
                companies are located outside Silicon Valley.''.
            (4) According to a report entitled, ``Developer Economics 
        Q1 2015: State of the Developer Nation'', dated February 2015, 
        ``The emergence of the app industry over the past eight years 
        has grown to a $120 billion economy.''.
