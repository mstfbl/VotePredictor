                        TITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS

SEC. 401. ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Administrative 
Leave Act of 2016''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) agency use of administrative leave, and leave that is 
        referred to incorrectly as administrative leave in agency 
        recording practices, has exceeded reasonable amounts--
                    (A) in contravention of--
                            (i) established precedent of the 
                        Comptroller General of the United States; and
                            (ii) guidance provided by the Office of 
                        Personnel Management; and
                    (B) resulting in significant cost to the Federal 
                Government;
            (2) administrative leave should be used sparingly;
            (3) prior to the use of paid leave to address personnel 
        issues, an agency should consider other actions, including--
                    (A) temporary reassignment;
                    (B) transfer; and
                    (C) telework;
            (4) an agency should prioritize and expeditiously conclude 
        an investigation in which an employee is placed in 
        administrative leave so that, not later than the conclusion of 
        the leave period--
                    (A) the employee is returned to duty status; or
                    (B) an appropriate personnel action is taken with 
                respect to the employee;
            (5) data show that there are too many examples of employees 
        placed in administrative leave for 6 months or longer, leaving 
        the employees without any available recourse to--
                    (A) return to duty status; or
                    (B) challenge the decision of the agency;
            (6) an agency should ensure accurate and consistent 
        recording of the use of administrative leave so that 
        administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; 
        and
            (7) other forms of excused absence authorized by law should 
        be recorded separately from administrative leave, as defined by 
        the amendments made by this section.
    (c) Administrative Leave.--
            (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 63 of title 5,
