                during the term of the lease to mitigate for a

                permitted activity; and
                    ``(B) shall be adjusted to account for the 
                cessation, in whole or in part, of the impacts caused 
                by the permitted activity.

                have been restored pursuant to the restoration and 
                rehabilitation plan, the land subject to the lease 
                shall revert back to the State or Indian tribe, as
