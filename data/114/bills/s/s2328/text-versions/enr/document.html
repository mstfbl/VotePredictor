of fiscal years as determined by the Oversight Board in its sole 
discretion but in any case a period of not less than one fiscal year 
following the fiscal year in which the notice is delivered. The notice 
may also set forth a schedule for revisions to Budgets that have 
already been certified, which revisions must be subject to subsequent 
approval and certification by the Oversight Board. The Oversight Board 
shall consult with the Governor and the Legislature in establishing a 
schedule, but the Oversight Board shall retain sole discretion to set 
or, by delivery of a subsequent notice to the Governor and the 
Legislature, change the dates of such schedule as it deems appropriate 
and reasonably feasible.
    (b) Revenue Forecast.--The Oversight Board shall submit to the 
Governor and Legislature a forecast of revenues for the period covered 
by the Budgets by the time specified in the notice delivered under 
subsection (a), for use by the Governor in developing the Budget under 
subsection (c).
    (c) Budgets Developed by Governor.--
        (1) Governor's proposed budgets.--The Governor shall submit to 
    the Oversight Board proposed Budgets by the time specified in the 
    notice delivered under subsection (a). In consultation with the 
    Governor in accordance with the process specified in the notice 
    delivered under subsection (a), the Oversight Board shall determine 
    in its sole discretion whether each proposed Budget is compliant 
    with the applicable Fiscal Plan and--
            (A) if a proposed Budget is a compliant budget, the 
        Oversight Board shall--
                (i) approve the Budget; and
                (ii) if the Budget is a Territory Budget, submit the 
            Territory Budget to the Legislature; or
            (B) if the Oversight Board determines that the Budget is 
        not a compliant budget, the Oversight Board shall provide to 
        the Governor--
                (i) a notice of violation that includes a description 
            of any necessary corrective action; and
                (ii) an opportunity to correct the violation in 
            accordance with paragraph (2).
        (2) Governor's revisions.--The Governor may correct any 
    violations identified by the Oversight Board and submit a revised 
    proposed Budget to the Oversight Board in accordance with paragraph 
    (1). The Governor may submit as many revised Budgets to the 
    Oversight Board as the schedule established in the notice delivered 
    under subsection (a) permits. If the Governor fails to develop a 
    Budget that the Oversight Board determines is a compliant budget by 
    the time specified in the notice delivered under subsection (a), 
    the Oversight Board shall develop and submit to the Governor, in 
    the case of an Instrumentality Budget, and to the Governor and the 
    Legislature, in the case of a Territory Budget, a revised compliant 
    budget.
    (d) Budget Approval by Legislature.--
        (1) Legislature adopted budget.--The Legislature shall submit 
    to the Oversight Board the Territory Budget adopted by the 
    Legislature by the time specified in the notice delivered under 
    subsection (a). The Oversight Board shall determine whether the 
    adopted Territory Budget is a compliant budget and--
            (A) if the adopted Territory Budget is a compliant budget, 
        the Oversight Board shall issue a compliance certification for 
        such compliant budget pursuant to subsection (e); and
            (B) if the adopted Territory Budget is not a compliant 
        budget, the Oversight Board shall provide to the Legislature--
                (i) a notice of violation that includes a description 
            of any necessary corrective action; and
                (ii) an opportunity to correct the violation in 
            accordance with paragraph (2).
        (2) Legislature's revisions.--The Legislature may correct any 
    violations identified by the Oversight Board and submit a revised 
    Territory Budget to the Oversight Board in accordance with the 
    process established under paragraph (1) and by the time specified 
    in the notice delivered under subsection (a). The Legislature may 
    submit as many revised adopted Territory Budgets to the Oversight 
    Board as the schedule established in the notice delivered under 
    subsection (a) permits. If the Legislature fails to adopt a 
    Territory Budget that the Oversight Board determines is a compliant 
    budget by the time specified in the notice delivered under 
    subsection (a), the Oversight Board shall develop a revised 
    Territory Budget that is a compliant budget and submit it to the 
    Governor and the Legislature.
    (e) Certification of Budgets.--
        (1) Certification of developed and approved territory 
    budgets.--If the Governor and the Legislature develop and approve a 
    Territory Budget that is a compliant budget by the day before the 
    first day of the fiscal year for which the Territory Budget is 
    being developed and in accordance with the process established 
    under subsections (c) and (d), the Oversight Board shall issue a 
    compliance certification to the Governor and the Legislature for 
    such Territory Budget.
        (2) Certification of developed instrumentality budgets.--If the 
    Governor develops an Instrumentality Budget that is a compliant 
    budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year for which 
    the Instrumentality Budget is being developed and in accordance 
    with the process established under subsection (c), the Oversight 
    Board shall issue a compliance certification to the Governor for 
    such Instrumentality Budget.
        (3) Deemed certification of territory budgets.--If the Governor 
    and the Legislature fail to develop and approve a Territory Budget 
    that is a compliant budget by the day before the first day of the 
    fiscal year for which the Territory Budget is being developed, the 
    Oversight Board shall submit a Budget to the Governor and the 
    Legislature (including any revision to the Territory Budget made by 
    the Oversight Board pursuant to subsection (d)(2)) and such Budget 
    shall be--
            (A) deemed to be approved by the Governor and the 
        Legislature;
            (B) the subject of a compliance certification issued by the 
        Oversight Board to the Governor and the Legislature; and
            (C) in full force and effect beginning on the first day of 
        the applicable fiscal year.
        (4) Deemed certification of instrumentality budgets.--If the 
    Governor fails to develop an Instrumentality Budget that is a 
    compliant budget by the day before the first day of the fiscal year 
    for which the Instrumentality Budget is being developed, the 
    Oversight Board shall submit an Instrumentality Budget to the 
    Governor (including any revision to the Instrumentality Budget made 
    by the Oversight Board pursuant to subsection (c)(2)) and such 
    Budget shall be--
            (A) deemed to be approved by the Governor;
            (B) the subject of a compliance certification issued by the 
        Oversight Board to the Governor; and
            (C) in full force and effect beginning on the first day of 
        the applicable fiscal year.
    (f) Joint Development of Budgets.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, if, in the case of a Territory Budget, the 
Governor, the Legislature, and the Oversight Board, or in the case of 
an Instrumentality Budget, the Governor and the Oversight Board, 
jointly develop such Budget for the fiscal year that meets the 
requirements under this section, and that the relevant parties certify 
that such budget reflects a consensus among them, then such Budget 
shall serve as the Budget for the territory or territorial 
instrumentality for that fiscal year.
    SEC. 203. EFFECT OF FINDING OF NONCOMPLIANCE WITH BUDGET.
    (a) Submission of Reports.--Not later than 15 days after the last 
day of each quarter of a fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 
determined by the Oversight Board), the Governor shall submit to the 
Oversight Board a report, in such form as the Oversight Board may 
require, describing--
        (1) the actual cash revenues, cash expenditures, and cash flows 
    of the territorial government for the preceding quarter, as 
    compared to the projected revenues, expenditures, and cash flows 
    contained in the certified Budget for such preceding quarter; and
        (2) any other information requested by the Oversight Board, 
    which may include a balance sheet or a requirement that the 
    Governor provide information for each covered territorial 
    instrumentality separately.
    (b) Initial Action by Oversight Board.--
        (1) In general.--If the Oversight Board determines, based on 
    reports submitted by the Governor under subsection (a), independent 
    audits, or such other information as the Oversight Board may 
    obtain, that the actual quarterly revenues, expenditures, or cash 
    flows of the territorial government are not consistent with the 
    projected revenues, expenditures, or cash flows set forth in the 
    certified Budget for such quarter, the Oversight Board shall--
            (A) require the territorial government to provide such 
        additional information as the Oversight Board determines to be 
        necessary to explain the inconsistency; and
            (B) if the additional information provided under 
        subparagraph (A) does not provide an explanation for the 
        inconsistency that the Oversight Board finds reasonable and 
        appropriate, advise the territorial government to correct the 
        inconsistency by implementing remedial action.
        (2) Deadlines.--The Oversight Board shall establish the 
    deadlines by which the territorial government shall meet the 
    requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).
    (c) Certification.--
        (1) Inconsistency.--If the territorial government fails to 
    provide additional information under subsection (b)(1)(A), or fails 
    to correct an inconsistency under subsection (b)(1)(B), prior to 
    the applicable deadline under subsection (b)(2), the Oversight 
    Board shall certify to the President, the House of Representatives 
    Committee on Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Energy and 
    Natural Resources, the Governor, and the Legislature that the 
    territorial government is inconsistent with the applicable 
    certified Budget, and shall describe the nature and amount of the 
    inconsistency.
        (2) Correction.--If the Oversight Board determines that the 
    territorial government has initiated such measures as the Oversight 
    Board considers sufficient to correct an inconsistency certified 
    under paragraph (1), the Oversight Board shall certify the 
    correction to the President, the House of Representatives Committee 
    on Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural 
    Resources, the Governor, and the Legislature.
    (d) Budget Reductions by Oversight Board.--If the Oversight Board 
determines that the Governor, in the case of any then-applicable 
certified Instrumentality Budgets, and the Governor and the 
Legislature, in the case of the then-applicable certified Territory 
Budget, have failed to correct an inconsistency identified by the 
Oversight Board under subsection (c), the Oversight Board shall--
        (1) with respect to the territorial government, other than 
    covered territorial instrumentalities, make appropriate reductions 
    in nondebt expenditures to ensure that the actual quarterly 
    revenues and expenditures for the territorial government are in 
    compliance with the applicable certified Territory Budget or, in 
    the case of the fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is 
    established, the budget adopted by the Governor and the 
    Legislature; and
        (2) with respect to covered territorial instrumentalities at 
    the sole discretion of the Oversight Board--
            (A) make reductions in nondebt expenditures to ensure that 
        the actual quarterly revenues and expenses for the covered 
        territorial instrumentality are in compliance with the 
        applicable certified Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year 
        in which the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted 
        by the Governor and the Legislature or the covered territorial 
        instrumentality, as applicable; or
            (B)(i) institute automatic hiring freezes at the covered 
        territorial instrumentality; and
            (ii) prohibit the covered territorial instrumentality from 
        entering into any contract or engaging in any financial or 
        other transactions, unless the contract or transaction was 
        previously approved by the Oversight Board.
    (e) Termination of Budget Reductions.--The Oversight Board shall 
cancel the reductions, hiring freezes, or prohibition on contracts and 
financial transactions under subsection (d) if the Oversight Board 
determines that the territorial government or covered territorial 
instrumentality, as applicable, has initiated appropriate measures to 
reduce expenditures or increase revenues to ensure that the territorial 
government or covered territorial instrumentality is in compliance with 
the applicable certified Budget or, in the case of the fiscal year in 
which the Oversight Board is established, the budget adopted by the 
Governor and the Legislature.
    SEC. 204. REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH FISCAL 
      PLAN.
    (a) Submission of Legislative Acts to Oversight Board.--
        (1) Submission of acts.--Except to the extent that the 
    Oversight Board may provide otherwise in its bylaws, rules, and 
    procedures, not later than 7 business days after a territorial 
    government duly enacts any law during any fiscal year in which the 
    Oversight Board is in operation, the Governor shall submit the law 
    to the Oversight Board.
        (2) Cost estimate; certification of compliance or 
    noncompliance.--The Governor shall include with each law submitted 
    to the Oversight Board under paragraph (1) the following:
            (A) A formal estimate prepared by an appropriate entity of 
        the territorial government with expertise in budgets and 
        financial management of the impact, if any, that the law will 
        have on expenditures and revenues.
            (B) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) 
        finds that the law is not significantly inconsistent with the 
        Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a certification 
        of such finding.
            (C) If the appropriate entity described in subparagraph (A) 
        finds that the law is significantly inconsistent with the 
        Fiscal Plan for the fiscal year, it shall issue a certification 
        of such finding, together with the entity's reasons for such 
        finding.
        (3) Notification.--The Oversight Board shall send a 
    notification to the Governor and the Legislature if--
            (A) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under 
        this subsection that is not accompanied by the estimate 
        required under paragraph (2)(A);
            (B) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under 
        this subsection that is not accompanied by either a 
        certification described in paragraph (2)(B) or (2)(C); or
            (C) the Governor submits a law to the Oversight Board under 
        this subsection that is accompanied by a certification 
        described in paragraph (2)(C) that the law is significantly 
        inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan.
        (4) Opportunity to respond to notification.--
            (A) Failure to provide estimate or certification.--After 
        sending a notification to the Governor and the Legislature 
        under paragraph (3)(A) or (3)(B) with respect to a law, the 
        Oversight Board may direct the Governor to provide the missing 
        estimate or certification (as the case may be), in accordance 
        with such procedures as the Oversight Board may establish.
            (B) Submission of certification of significant 
        inconsistency with fiscal plan and budget.--In accordance with 
        such procedures as the Oversight Board may establish, after 
        sending a notification to the Governor and Legislature under 
        paragraph (3)(C) that a law is significantly inconsistent with 
        the Fiscal Plan, the Oversight Board shall direct the 
        territorial government to--
                (i) correct the law to eliminate the inconsistency; or
                (ii) provide an explanation for the inconsistency that 
            the Oversight Board finds reasonable and appropriate.
        (5) Failure to comply.--If the territorial government fails to 
    comply with a direction given by the Oversight Board under 
    paragraph (4) with respect to a law, the Oversight Board may take 
    such actions as it considers necessary, consistent with this Act, 
    to ensure that the enactment or enforcement of the law will not 
    adversely affect the territorial government's compliance with the 
    Fiscal Plan, including preventing the enforcement or application of 
    the law.
        (6) Preliminary review of proposed acts.--At the request of the 
    Legislature, the Oversight Board may conduct a preliminary review 
    of proposed legislation before the Legislature to determine whether 
    the legislation as proposed would be consistent with the applicable 
    Fiscal Plan under this subtitle, except that any such preliminary 
    review shall not be binding on the Oversight Board in reviewing any 
    law subsequently submitted under this subsection.
    (b) Effect of Approved Fiscal Plan on Contracts, Rules, and 
Regulations.--
        (1) Transparency in contracting.--The Oversight Board shall 
    work with a covered territory's office of the comptroller or any 
    functionally equivalent entity to promote compliance with the 
    applicable law of any covered territory that requires agencies and 
    instrumentalities of the territorial government to maintain a 
    registry of all contracts executed, including amendments thereto, 
    and to remit a copy to the office of the comptroller for inclusion 
    in a comprehensive database available to the public. With respect 
    to Puerto Rico, the term ``applicable law'' refers to 2 L.P.R.A. 
    97, as amended.
        (2) Authority to review certain contracts.--The Oversight Board 
    may establish policies to require prior Oversight Board approval of 
    certain contracts, including leases and contracts to a governmental 
    entity or government-owned corporations rather than private 
    enterprises that are proposed to be executed by the territorial 
    government, to ensure such proposed contracts promote market 
    competition and are not inconsistent with the approved Fiscal Plan.
        (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any 
    policies established by the Oversight Board pursuant to paragraph 
    (2) should be designed to make the government contracting process 
    more effective, to increase the public's faith in this process, to 
    make appropriate use of the Oversight Board's time and resources, 
    to make the territorial government a facilitator and not a 
    competitor to private enterprise, and to avoid creating any 
    additional bureaucratic obstacles to efficient contracting.
        (4) Authority to review certain rules, regulations, and 
    executive orders.--The provisions of this paragraph shall apply 
    with respect to a rule, regulation, or executive order proposed to 
    be issued by the Governor (or the head of any department or agency 
    of the territorial government) in the same manner as such 
    provisions apply to a contract.
        (5) Failure to comply.--If a contract, rule, regulation, or 
    executive order fails to comply with policies established by the 
    Oversight Board under this subsection, the Oversight Board may take 
    such actions as it considers necessary to ensure that such 
    contract, rule, executive order or regulation will not adversely 
    affect the territorial government's compliance with the Fiscal 
    Plan, including by preventing the execution or enforcement of the 
    contract, rule, executive order or regulation.
    (c) Restrictions on Budgetary Adjustments.--
        (1) Submissions of requests to oversight board.--If the 
    Governor submits a request to the Legislature for the reprogramming 
    of any amounts provided in a certified Budget, the Governor shall 
    submit such request to the Oversight Board, which shall analyze 
    whether the proposed reprogramming is significantly inconsistent 
    with the Budget, and submit its analysis to the Legislature as soon 
    as practicable after receiving the request.
        (2) No action permitted until analysis received.--The 
    Legislature shall not adopt a reprogramming, and no officer or 
    employee of the territorial government may carry out any 
    reprogramming, until the Oversight Board has provided the 
    Legislature with an analysis that certifies such reprogramming will 
    not be inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan and Budget.
        (3) Prohibition on action until oversight board is appointed.--
            (A) During the period after a territory becomes a covered 
        territory and prior to the appointment of all members and the 
        Chair of the Oversight Board, such covered territory shall not 
        enact new laws that either permit the transfer of any funds or 
        assets outside the ordinary course of business or that are 
        inconsistent with the constitution or laws of the territory as 
        of the date of enactment of this Act, provided that any 
        executive or legislative action authorizing the movement of 
        funds or assets during this time period may be subject to 
        review and rescission by the Oversight Board upon appointment 
        of the Oversight Board's full membership.
        (B) Upon appointment of the Oversight Board's full membership, 
    the Oversight Board may review, and in its sole discretion, 
    rescind, any law that--
            (i) was enacted during the period between, with respect to 
        Puerto Rico, May 4, 2016; or with respect to any other 
        territory, 45 days prior to the establishment of the Oversight 
        Board for such territory, and the date of appointment of all 
        members and the Chair of the Oversight Board; and
            (ii) alters pre-existing priorities of creditors in a 
        manner outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent 
        with the territory's constitution or the laws of the territory 
        as of, in the case of Puerto Rico, May 4, 2016, or with respect 
        to any other territory, 45 days prior to the establishment of 
        the Oversight Board for such territory;
    but such rescission shall only be to the extent that the law alters 
    such priorities.
    (d) Implementation of Federal Programs.--In taking actions under 
this Act, the Oversight Board shall not exercise applicable authorities 
to impede territorial actions taken to--
        (1) comply with a court-issued consent decree or injunction, or 
    an administrative order or settlement with a Federal agency, with 
    respect to Federal programs;
        (2) implement a federally authorized or federally delegated 
    program;
        (3) implement territorial laws, which are consistent with a 
    certified Fiscal Plan, that execute Federal requirements and 
    standards; or
        (4) preserve and maintain federally funded mass transportation 
    assets.
    SEC. 205. RECOMMENDATIONS ON FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MANAGEMENT 
      RESPONSIBILITY.
    (a) In General.--The Oversight Board may at any time submit 
recommendations to the Governor or the Legislature on actions the 
territorial government may take to ensure compliance with the Fiscal 
Plan, or to otherwise promote the financial stability, economic growth, 
management responsibility, and service delivery efficiency of the 
territorial government, including recommendations relating to--
        (1) the management of the territorial government's financial 
    affairs, including economic forecasting and multiyear fiscal 
    forecasting capabilities, information technology, placing controls 
    on expenditures for personnel, reducing benefit costs, reforming 
    procurement practices, and placing other controls on expenditures;
        (2) the structural relationship of departments, agencies, and 
    independent agencies within the territorial government;
        (3) the modification of existing revenue structures, or the 
    establishment of additional revenue structures;
        (4) the establishment of alternatives for meeting obligations 
    to pay for the pensions of territorial government employees;
        (5) modifications or transfers of the types of services that 
    are the responsibility of, and are delivered by the territorial 
    government;
        (6) modifications of the types of services that are delivered 
    by entities other than the territorial government under alternative 
    service delivery mechanisms;
        (7) the effects of the territory's laws and court orders on the 
    operations of the territorial government;
        (8) the establishment of a personnel system for employees of 
    the territorial government that is based upon employee performance 
    standards;
        (9) the improvement of personnel training and proficiency, the 
    adjustment of staffing levels, and the improvement of training and 
    performance of management and supervisory personnel; and
        (10) the privatization and commercialization of entities within 
    the territorial government.
    (b) Response to Recommendations by the Territorial Government.--
        (1) In general.--In the case of any recommendations submitted 
    under subsection (a) that are within the authority of the 
    territorial government to adopt, not later than 90 days after 
    receiving the recommendations, the Governor or the Legislature 
    (whichever has the authority to adopt the recommendation) shall 
    submit a statement to the Oversight Board that provides notice as 
    to whether the territorial government will adopt the 
    recommendations.
        (2) Implementation plan required for adopted recommendations.--
    If the Governor or the Legislature (whichever is applicable) 
    notifies the Oversight Board under paragraph (1) that the 
    territorial government will adopt any of the recommendations 
    submitted under subsection (a), the Governor or the Legislature 
    (whichever is applicable) shall include in the statement a written 
    plan to implement the recommendation that includes--
            (A) specific performance measures to determine the extent 
        to which the territorial government has adopted the 
        recommendation; and
            (B) a clear and specific timetable pursuant to which the 
        territorial government will implement the recommendation.
        (3) Explanations required for recommendations not adopted.--If 
    the Governor or the Legislature (whichever is applicable) notifies 
    the Oversight Board under paragraph (1) that the territorial 
    government will not adopt any recommendation submitted under 
    subsection (a) that the territorial government has authority to 
    adopt, the Governor or the Legislature shall include in the 
    statement explanations for the rejection of the recommendations, 
    and the Governor or the Legislature shall submit such statement of 
    explanations to the President and Congress.
    SEC. 206. OVERSIGHT BOARD DUTIES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING.
    (a) Requirements for Restructuring Certification.--The Oversight 
Board, prior to issuing a restructuring certification regarding an 
entity (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 11, United 
States Code), shall determine, in its sole discretion, that--
        (1) the entity has made good-faith efforts to reach a 
    consensual restructuring with creditors;
        (2) the entity has--
            (A) adopted procedures necessary to deliver timely audited

        (6) Except as provided in section 304(d), an appeal of an 
    interlocutory order or decree does not stay any proceeding of the 
    district court from which the appeal is taken unless the district 
    court, or the court of appeals in which the appeal is pending, 
    issues a stay of such proceedings pending the appeal.

    interlocutory appeal of an order or decree shall be made not later

    A lease to a territory or territorial instrumentality shall not be 
treated as an executory contract or unexpired lease for the purposes of 
section 365 or 502(b)(6) of title 11, United States Code, solely by 
reason of the lease being subject to termination in the event the 
debtor fails to appropriate rent.
    SEC. 312. FILING OF PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT.
    (a) Exclusivity.--Only the Oversight Board, after the issuance of a 
certificate pursuant to section 104(j) of this Act, may file a plan of 
adjustment of the debts of the debtor.
    (b) Deadline for Filing Plan.--If the Oversight Board does not file 
a plan of adjustment with the petition, the Oversight Board shall file 
a plan of adjustment at the time set by the court.
    SEC. 313. MODIFICATION OF PLAN.
    The Oversight Board, after the issuance of a certification pursuant 
to section 104(j) of this Act, may modify the plan at any time before 
confirmation, but may not modify the plan so that the plan as modified 
fails to meet the requirements of this title. After the Oversight Board 
files a modification, the plan as modified becomes the plan.
    SEC. 314. CONFIRMATION.
    (a) Objection.--A special tax payer may object to confirmation of a 
plan.
    (b) Confirmation.--The court shall confirm the plan if--

    United States Code, made applicable to a case under this title by 
    section 301 of this Act;
        (2) the plan complies with the provisions of this title;
        (3) the debtor is not prohibited by law from taking any action 
    necessary to carry out the plan;
        (4) except to the extent that the holder of a particular claim 
    has agreed to a different treatment of such claim, the plan 
    provides that on the effective date of the plan each holder of a 
    claim of a kind specified in 507(a)(2) of title 11, United States 
    Code, will receive on account of such claim cash equal to the 
    allowed amount of such claim;
        (5) any legislative, regulatory, or electoral approval 
    necessary under applicable law in order to carry out any provision 
    of the plan has been obtained, or such provision is expressly 
    conditioned on such approval;
        (6) the plan is feasible and in the best interests of 
    creditors, which shall require the court to consider whether 
    available remedies under the non-bankruptcy laws and constitution 
    of the territory would result in a greater recovery for the 
    creditors than is provided by such plan; and
        (7) the plan is consistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan 
    certified by the Oversight Board under title II.
    (c) Confirmation for Debtors With a Single Class of Claims.--If all 
of the requirements of section 314(b) of this title and section 1129(a) 
of title 11, United States Code, incorporated into this title by 
section 301 other than sections 1129(a)(8) and 1129(a)(10) are met with 
respect to a plan--
        (1) with respect to which all claims are substantially similar 
    under section 301(e) of this title;
        (2) that includes only one class of claims, which claims are 
    impaired claims; and
        (3) that was not accepted by such impaired class,
the court shall confirm the plan notwithstanding the requirements of 
such sections 1129(a)(8) and 1129(a)(10) of title 11, United States 
Code if the plan is fair and equitable and does not discriminate 
unfairly with respect to such impaired class.

employed by the debtor (in the debtor's sole discretion), the Oversight 
Board (in the Oversight Board's sole discretion), a committee under 
section 1103 of title 11, United States Code, or a trustee appointed by

States Trustee or any other party in interest, award compensation that 
is less than the amount of compensation that is requested.

awarded to a professional person, the court shall consider the nature, 
the extent, and the value of such services, taking into account all 
relevant factors, including--
        (1) the time spent on such services;

        (4) whether the services were performed within a reasonable 
    amount of time commensurate with the complexity, importance, and 
    nature of the problem, issue, or task addressed;
        (5) with respect to a professional person, whether the person 
    is board certified or otherwise has demonstrated skill and 
    experience in the restructuring field; and

            (A) reasonably likely to benefit the debtor; or
            (B) necessary to the administration of the case.
    (e) The court shall reduce the amount of compensation awarded under 
this section by the amount of any interim compensation awarded under 
section 317 of this title, and, if the amount of such interim 
compensation exceeds the amount of compensation awarded under this 
section, may order the return of the excess to the debtor.
    (f) Any compensation awarded for the preparation of a fee 
application shall be based on the level and skill reasonably required 
to prepare the application.

this title, or more often if the court permits, for such compensation 
for services rendered before the date of such an application or 
reimbursement for expenses incurred before such date as is provided

    SEC. 403. FIRST MINIMUM WAGE IN PUERTO RICO.

designate a time period not to exceed four years during which employers 
in Puerto Rico may pay employees who are initially employed after the 
date of enactment of such Act a wage which is not less than the wage 
described in paragraph (1). Notwithstanding the time period designated, 
such wage shall not continue in effect after such Board terminates in 
accordance with section 209 of such Act.

    (a) Special Rule.--The regulations proposed by the Secretary of 
Labor relating to exemptions regarding the rates of pay for executive, 
administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees, 
and published in a notice in the Federal Register on July 6, 2015, and

force or effect in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico until--
        (1) the Comptroller General of the United States completes the 
    assessment and transmits the report required under subsection (b);

        (2) the Secretary of Labor, taking into account the assessment

of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall examine the 
economic conditions in Puerto Rico and shall transmit a report to 
Congress assessing the impact of applying the regulations described in

    Population Survey, which is jointly administered by the Bureau of 
    the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and which is the 
    primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the 
    United States; and
        (2) if necessary, the Bureau of the Census should request the 
    funding required to conduct this feasibility study as part of its 
    budget submission to Congress for fiscal year 2018.

    other source of law related to such a bond, loan, letter of credit, 
    other borrowing title, obligation of insurance, or other financial 
    indebtedness in physical or dematerialized form, of which--

        enactment of this Act.
        (2) Liability claim.--The term ``Liability Claim'' means, as it 
    relates to a Liability--
            (A) right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced

        fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, 
        secured, or unsecured.
    (b) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (c) of this 
section, the establishment of an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico (i.e., 
the enactment of this Act) in accordance with section 101 operates with 
respect to a Liability as a stay, applicable to all entities (as such 
term is defined in section 101 of title 11, United States Code), of--
        (1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or 
    employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other 
    action or proceeding against the Government of Puerto Rico that was 
    or could have been commenced before the enactment of this Act, or 
    to recover a Liability Claim against the Government of Puerto Rico 
    that arose before the enactment of this Act;
        (2) the enforcement, against the Government of Puerto Rico or 
    against property of the Government of Puerto Rico, of a judgment 
    obtained before the enactment of this Act;
        (3) any act to obtain possession of property of the Government 
    of Puerto Rico or of property from the Government of Puerto Rico or

    property of the Government of Puerto Rico;

    the Government of Puerto Rico any lien to the extent that such lien 
    secures a Liability Claim that arose before the enactment of this 
    Act;
        (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a Liability Claim 
    against the Government of Puerto Rico that arose before the 
    enactment of this Act; and

    Rico that arose before the enactment of this Act against any 
    Liability Claim against the Government of Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico in accordance with section 101 does not operate as a stay--
        (1) solely under subsection (b)(1) of this section, of the 
    continuation of, including the issuance or employment of process, 
    of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding 
    against the Government of Puerto Rico that was commenced on or 
    before December 18, 2015; or
        (2) of the commencement or continuation of an action or 
    proceeding by a governmental unit to enforce such governmental 
    unit's or organization's police and regulatory power, including the 
    enforcement of a judgment other than a money judgment, obtained in 
    an action or proceeding by the governmental unit to enforce such 
    governmental unit's or organization's police or regulatory power.
    (d) Continuation of Stay.--Except as provided in subsections (e), 
(f), and (g) the stay under subsection (b) continues until the earlier 
of--
        (1) the later of--
            (A) the later of--
                (i) February 15, 2017; or
                (ii) six months after the establishment of an Oversight 
            Board for Puerto Rico as established by section 101(b);
            (B) the date that is 75 days after the date in subparagraph 
        (A) if the Oversight Board delivers a certification to the 
        Governor that, in the Oversight Board's sole discretion, an 
        additional 75 days are needed to seek to complete a voluntary 
        process under title VI of this Act with respect to the 
        government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its 
        territorial instrumentalities; or
            (C) the date that is 60 days after the date in subparagraph 
        (A) if the district court to which an application has been 
        submitted under subparagraph 601(m)(1)(D) of this Act 
        determines, in the exercise of the court's equitable powers, 
        that an additional 60 days are needed to complete a voluntary 
        process under title VI of this Act with respect to the 
        government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its 
        territorial instrumentalities; or
        (2) with respect to the government of the Commonwealth of 
    Puerto Rico or any of its territorial instrumentalities, the date 
    on which a case is filed by or on behalf of the government of the 
    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any of its territorial 
    instrumentalities, as applicable, under title III.
    (e) Jurisdiction, Relief From Stay.--
        (1) The United States District Court for the District of Puerto 
    Rico shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of any civil 
    actions arising under or related to this section.
        (2) On motion of or action filed by a party in interest and 
    after notice and a hearing, the United States District Court for 
    the District of Puerto Rico, for cause shown, shall grant relief 
    from the stay provided under subsection (b) of this section.
    (f) Termination of Stay; Hearing.--Forty-five days after a request 
under subsection (e)(2) for relief from the stay of any act against 
property of the Government of Puerto Rico under subsection (b), such 
stay is terminated with respect to the party in interest making such 
request, unless the court, after notice and a hearing, orders such stay 
continued in effect pending the conclusion of, or as a result of, a 
final hearing and determination under subsection (e)(2). A hearing 
under this subsection may be a preliminary hearing, or may be 
consolidated with the final hearing under subsection (e)(2). The court 
shall order such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of the 
final hearing under subsection (e)(2) if there is a reasonable 
likelihood that the party opposing relief from such stay will prevail 
at the conclusion of such final hearing. If the hearing under this 
subsection is a preliminary hearing, then such final hearing shall be 
concluded not later than thirty days after the conclusion of such 
preliminary hearing, unless the thirty-day period is extended with the 
consent of the parties in interest or for a specific time which the 
court finds is required by compelling circumstances.
    (g) Relief To Prevent Irreparable Damage.--Upon request of a party 
in interest, the court, with or without a hearing, shall grant such 
relief from the stay provided under subsection (b) as is necessary to 
prevent irreparable damage to the interest of an entity in property, if 
such interest will suffer such damage before there is an opportunity 
for notice and a hearing under subsection (e) or (f).
    (h) Act in Violation of Stay Is Void.--Any order, judgment, or 
decree entered in violation of this section and any act taken in 
violation of this section is void, and shall have no force or effect, 
and any person found to violate this section may be liable for damages, 
costs, and attorneys' fees incurred in defending any action taken in 
violation of this section, and the Oversight Board or the Government of 
Puerto Rico may seek an order from the court enforcing the provisions 
of this section.
    (i) Government of Puerto Rico.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``Government of Puerto Rico'', in addition to the definition set 
forth in section 5(11) of this Act, shall include--
        (1) the individuals, including elected and appointed officials, 
    directors, officers of and employees acting in their official 
    capacity on behalf of the Government of Puerto Rico; and
        (2) the Oversight Board, including the directors and officers 
    of and employees acting in their official capacity on behalf of the 
    Oversight Board.
    (j) No Default Under Existing Contracts.--
        (1) Notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law 
    to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in 
    effect, the holder of a Liability Claim or any other claim (as such 
    term is defined in section 101 of title 11, United States Code) may 
    not exercise or continue to exercise any remedy under a contract or 
    applicable law in respect to the Government of Puerto Rico or any 
    of its property--
            (A) that is conditioned upon the financial condition of, or 
        the commencement of a restructuring, insolvency, bankruptcy, or 
        other proceeding (or a similar or analogous process) by, the 
        Government of Puerto Rico, including a default or an event of 
        default thereunder; or
            (B) with respect to Liability Claims--
                (i) for the non-payment of principal or interest; or
                (ii) for the breach of any condition or covenant.
        (2) The term ``remedy'' as used in paragraph (1) shall be 
    interpreted broadly, and shall include any right existing in law or 
    contract, including any right to--
            (A) setoff;
            (B) apply or appropriate funds;
            (C) seek the appointment of a custodian (as such term is 
        defined in section 101(11) of title 11, United States Code);
            (D) seek to raise rates; or
            (E) exercise control over property of the Government of 
        Puerto Rico.
        (3) Notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law 
    to the contrary and so long as a stay under this section is in 
    effect, a contract to which the Government of Puerto Rico is a 
    party may not be terminated or modified, and any right or 
    obligation under such contract may not be terminated or modified, 
    solely because of a provision in such contract is conditioned on--
            (A) the insolvency or financial condition of the Government 
        of Puerto Rico at any time prior to the enactment of this Act;
            (B) the adoption of a resolution or establishment of an 
        Oversight Board pursuant to section 101 of this Act; or
            (C) a default under a separate contract that is due to, 
        triggered by, or a result of the occurrence of the events or 
        matters in paragraph (1)(B).
        (4) Notwithstanding any contractual provision to the contrary 
    and so long as a stay under this section is in effect, a 
    counterparty to a contract with the Government of Puerto Rico for 
    the provision of goods and services shall, unless the Government of 
    Puerto Rico agrees to the contrary in writing, continue to perform 
    all obligations under, and comply with the terms of, such contract, 
    provided that the Government of Puerto Rico is not in default under 
    such contract other than as a result of a condition specified in 
    paragraph (3).
    (k) Effect.--This section does not discharge an obligation of the 
Government of Puerto Rico or release, invalidate, or impair any 
security interest or lien securing such obligation. This section does 
not impair or affect the implementation of any restructuring support 
agreement executed by the Government of Puerto Rico to be implemented 
pursuant to Puerto Rico law specifically enacted for that purpose prior 
to the enactment of this Act or the obligation of the Government of 
Puerto Rico to proceed in good faith as set forth in any such 
agreement.
    (l) Payments on Liabilities.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prohibit the Government of Puerto Rico from making any 
payment on any Liability when such payment becomes due during the term 
of the stay, and to the extent the Oversight Board, in its sole 
discretion, determines it is feasible, the Government of Puerto Rico 
shall make interest payments on outstanding indebtedness when such 
payments become due during the length of the stay.
    (m) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) A combination of severe economic decline, and, at times, 
    accumulated operating deficits, lack of financial transparency, 
    management inefficiencies, and excessive borrowing has created a 
    fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico.
        (2) As a result of its fiscal emergency, the Government of 
    Puerto Rico has been unable to provide its citizens with effective 
    services.
        (3) The current fiscal emergency has also affected the long-
    term economic stability of Puerto Rico by contributing to the 
    accelerated outmigration of residents and businesses.
        (4) A comprehensive approach to fiscal, management, and 
    structural problems and adjustments that exempts no part of the 
    Government of Puerto Rico is necessary, involving independent 
    oversight and a Federal statutory authority for the Government of 
    Puerto Rico to restructure debts in a fair and orderly process.
        (5) Additionally, an immediate--but temporary--stay is 
    essential to stabilize the region for the purposes of resolving 
    this territorial crisis.
            (A) The stay advances the best interests common to all 
        stakeholders, including but not limited to a functioning 
        independent Oversight Board created pursuant to this Act to 
        determine whether to appear or intervene on behalf of the 
        Government of Puerto Rico in any litigation that may have been 
        commenced prior to the effectiveness or upon expiration of the 
        stay.
            (B) The stay is limited in nature and narrowly tailored to 
        achieve the purposes of this Act, including to ensure all 
        creditors have a fair opportunity to consensually renegotiate 
        terms of repayment based on accurate financial information that 
        is reviewed by an independent authority or, at a minimum, 
        receive a recovery from the Government of Puerto Rico equal to 
        their best possible outcome absent the provisions of this Act.

    time during which it can focus its resources on negotiating a 
    voluntary resolution with its creditors instead of defending 
    numerous, costly creditor lawsuits;
        (3) provide an oversight mechanism to assist the Government of 
    Puerto Rico in reforming its fiscal governance and support the 
    implementation of potential debt restructuring;
        (4) make available a Federal restructuring authority, if 
    necessary, to allow for an orderly adjustment of all of the 
    Government of Puerto Rico's liabilities; and

    in Puerto Rico by encouraging the Government of Puerto Rico to 
    resolve its longstanding fiscal governance issues and return to 
    economic growth.
    (o) Voting on Voluntary Agreements Not Stayed.--Notwithstanding any 
provision in this section to the contrary, nothing in this section

interest in, or lien on such property, or which deprives any such 
territorial instrumentality of property in violation of applicable law 
assuring the transfer of such property to such territorial 
instrumentality for the benefit of its creditors, then the transferee 
shall be liable for the value of such property.
    (b) Enforceability.--A creditor may enforce rights under this 
section by bringing an action in the United States District Court for

        criteria in subsection (a)(1).
            (B) A recommendation by the Governor whether the project 
        should be considered a Critical Project. If the Governor fails 
        to provide a recommendation during the development of the

        implementation of Land-Use Plans, as defined by Puerto Rico Act 
        550-2004, a determination by the Planning Board will be 
        required within the 60-day timeframe. If the Planning Board 
        determines such project will be inconsistent with relevant 
        Land-Use Plans, then the project will be deemed ineligible for 
        Critical Project designation.
            (D) In the case of an Energy Project that will connect with 
        the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's transmission or 
        distribution facilities, a recommendation by the Energy 
        Commission of Puerto Rico, if the Energy Commission determines 
        such Energy Project will affect an approved Integrated Resource 
        Plan, as defined under Puerto Rico Act 54-2014. If the Energy 
        Commission determines the Energy Project will adversely affect 
        an approved Integrated Resource Plan, then the Energy 
        Commission shall provide the reasons for such determination and 
        the Energy Project shall be ineligible for Critical Project 
        designation, provided that such determination must be made 
        during the 60-day timeframe for the development of the Critical 
        Project Report.
            (E) A recommendation by the Revitalization Coordinator 
        whether the project should be considered a Critical Project.
        (2) Public involvement.--Immediately following the completion 
    of the Critical Project Report, the Revitalization Coordinator 
    shall make such Critical Project Report public and allow a period 
    of 30 days for the submission of comments by residents of Puerto 
    Rico specifically on matters relating to the designation of a 
    project as a Critical Project. The Revitalization Coordinator shall 
    respond to the comments within 30 days of closing the coming period 
    and make the responses publicly available.
        (3) Submission to oversight board.--Not later than 5 days after 
    the Revitalization Coordinator has responded to the comments under 
    paragraph (2), the Revitalization Coordinator shall submit the 
    Critical Project Report to the Oversight Board.
    (c) Action by the Oversight Board.--Not later than 30 days after 
receiving the Critical Project Report, the Oversight Board, by majority 
vote, shall approve or disapprove the project as a Critical Project, if 
the Oversight Board--
        (1) approves the project, the project shall be deemed a 
    Critical Project; and
        (2) disapproves the project, the Oversight Board shall submit 
    to the Revitalization Coordinator in writing the reasons for 
    disapproval.

    established by the Revitalization Coordinator under section 
    503(a)(3).

    representative selected by the Governor in consultation with the 
    Revitalization Coordinator representing each of the following 
    agencies: The Environmental Quality Board, the Planning Board, the 
    Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, and 
    any other Puerto Rico Agency determined to be relevant by the

    the Puerto Rico Agency or Revitalization Coordinator has failed to 
    adhere to the Expedited Permitting Process, the Oversight Board 
    shall direct the offending party to comply with the Expedited 
    Permitting Process. The Oversight Board may take such enforcement

    duly enacted during any fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is 
    in operation that may affect the Expedited Permitting Process.
        (2) Finding of oversight board.--Upon receipt of a law under 
    paragraph (1), the Oversight Board shall promptly review whether 
    the law would adversely impact the Expedited Permitting Process

Agency may include in any certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or 
other authorization issued for a Critical Project any term or condition 
that may be permitted, but is not required, by any applicable Puerto 
Rico law, if the Revitalization Coordinator determines the term or 
condition would prevent or impair the expeditious construction, 
operation, or expansion of the Critical Project. The Revitalization 
Coordinator may request a Puerto Rico Agency to include in any 
certificate, right-of-way, permit, lease, or other authorization, a

conducted and actions taken by any Federal agency relating to a 
Critical Project shall be expedited in a manner consistent with 
completion of the necessary reviews and approvals by the deadlines 
under the Expedited Permitting Process, but in no way shall the 
deadlines established through the Expedited Permitting Process be

Modification. The holder of the right to vote the Outstanding Bonds 
that are Insured Bonds shall be the monoline insurer insuring such 
Insured Bond to the extent such insurer is granted the right to vote 
Insured Bonds for purposes of directing remedies or consenting to 
proposed amendments or modifications as provided in the applicable 
documents pursuant to which such Insured Bond was issued and insured.

Supervisor.
    (l) Information Agent.--For the purpose of administering a vote of 
holders of Bonds, including the holders of the right to vote such 
Bonds, or seeking the consent of holder of Bonds, including the holders

section, the Territory Government Issuer may appoint an Information 
Agent for each Pool reasonably acceptable to the Administrative 
Supervisor.

    and on all future holders of those Bonds whether or not notation of 
    such Qualifying Modification is made upon the Bonds, if--
            (A) the holders of the right to vote the Outstanding Bonds 
        in every Pool of the Issuer pursuant to subsection (j) have 
        consented to or approved the Qualifying Modification;

                (iii) except for such conditions that have been 
            identified in the Qualifying Modification as being non-
            waivable, any conditions on the effectiveness of the 
            Qualifying Modification have been satisfied or, in the 
            Administrative Supervisor's sole discretion, satisfaction 
            of such conditions has been waived;
            (C) with respect to a Bond Claim that is secured by a lien 
        on property and with respect to which the holder of such Bond 
        Claim has rejected or not consented to the Qualifying 
        Modification, the holder of such Bond--
                (i) retains the lien securing such Bond Claims; or
                (ii) receives on account of such Bond Claim, through 
            deferred cash payments, substitute collateral, or 
            otherwise, at least the equivalent value of the lesser of 
            the amount of the Bond Claim or of the collateral securing 
            such Bond Claim; and
            (D) the district court for the territory or, for any 
        territory that does not have a district court, the United 
        States District Court for the District of Hawaii, has, after 
        reviewing an application submitted to it by the applicable 
        Issuer for an order approving the Qualifying Modification, 
        entered an order that the requirements of this section have 
        been satisfied.
        (2) Upon the entry of an order under paragraph (1)(D), the 
    conclusive and binding Qualifying Modification shall be valid and 
    binding on any person or entity asserting claims or other rights, 
    including a beneficial interest (directly or indirectly, as 
    principal, agent, counterpart, subrogee, insurer or otherwise) in 
    respect of Bonds subject to the Qualifying Modification, any 
    trustee, any collateral agent, any indenture trustee, any fiscal 
    agent, and any bank that receives or holds funds related to such 
    Bonds. All property of an Issuer for which an order has been 
    entered under paragraph (1)(D) shall vest in the Issuer free and 
    clear of all claims in respect of any Bonds of any other Issuer. 
    Such Qualifying Modification will be full, final, complete, 
    binding, and conclusive as to the territorial government Issuer, 
    other territorial instrumentalities of the territorial government 
    Issuer, and any creditors of such entities, and should not be 
    subject to any collateral attack or other challenge by any such 
    entities in any court or other forum. Other than as provided 
    herein, the foregoing shall not prejudice the rights and claims of 
    any party that insured the Bonds, including the right to assert 
    claims under the Bonds as modified following any payment under the 
    insurance policy, and no claim or right that may be asserted by any 
    party in a capacity other than holder of a Bond affected by the 
    Qualifying Modification shall be satisfied, released, discharged, 
    or enjoined by this provision.
    (n) Judicial Review.--
        (1) The district court for the territory or, for any territory 
    that does not have a district court, the United States District 
    Court for the District of Hawaii shall have original and exclusive 
    jurisdiction over civil actions arising under this section.
        (2) Notwithstanding section 106(e), there shall be a cause of 
    action to challenge unlawful application of this section.
        (3) The district court shall nullify a Modification and any 
    effects on the rights of the holders of Bonds resulting from such 
    Modification if and only if the district court determines that such 
    Modification is manifestly inconsistent with this section.
