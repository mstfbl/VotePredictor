    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the 
case of a qualified resident of a United States possession--
            (1) there shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed 
        by section 1401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for any 
        taxable year which begins in the payroll tax holiday period an 
        amount equal to 3.1 percent of the lesser of--
                    (A) the self-employment income (as defined in 
                section 1402(b) of such Code) derived from sources 
                within a United States possession (as determined under 
                section 937(b) of such Code) for the taxable year, or
                    (B) the net earnings from self-employment (as 
                defined in section 1402(a) of such Code) for the 
                taxable year, and
            (2) with respect to remuneration received during the 
        payroll tax holiday period for services performed as an 
        employee within a United States possession (except amounts 
        received for services performed as an employee of the United 
        States or any agency thereof), the rate of tax under 3101(a) of 
        such Code shall be 3.1 percent (including for purposes of 
        determining the applicable percentage under sections 3201(a) 
        and 3211(a)(1) of such Code).
    (b) Special Rules.--
            (1) Application of rule for special refunds.--In the case 
        of an qualified resident of a United States possession to whom 
        subsection (a)(2) applies, the first sentence of section 
        6413(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be 
        applied by substituting for ``exceeds the tax with respect to 
        the amount of such wages received in such year which is equal 
        to such contribution and benefit base'' the following: 
        ``exceeds the sum of--
            ``(1) 3.1 percent of the lesser of--
                    ``(A) the wages received in such year to which 
                section 101(a)(2) of the Puerto Rico Assistance Act of 
                2015 applies, or
                    ``(B) the contribution and benefit base, plus
            ``(2) 6.2 percent of the lesser of--
                    ``(A) the wages received in such year to which such 
                section does not apply, or
                    ``(B) the contribution and benefits base reduced 
                (but not below zero) by the amount of wages taken into 
                account under paragraph (1).''.
            (2) Employer liability.--An employer who receives an 
        attestation from an employee, in such form and manner as 
        directed by the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's 
        delegate), that such employee is a qualified resident of a 
        United States possession shall not be liable under section 3102 
        or 3202 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for any failure to 
        collect taxes in excess of the rate which applies under this 
        section unless a reasonable person would determine that such 
        attestation is not true and correct.
            (3) De minimis services.--For purposes of subsection 
        (a)(2), services performed as an employee outside of a United 
        States possession shall not be taken into account if such 
        services are de minimis.

                principles of section 911(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
                Code of 1986 without regard to the second sentence 
                thereof) outside of a United States possession and does 
                not have a closer connection (determined under the 
                principles of section 7701(b)(3)(B)(ii) of such Code) 
                to the United States or a foreign country than to a 
                United States possession.
        For purposes of subparagraph (A), the determination of whether

        subsection (a)(1), and
            (2) by substituting ``4.65 percent'' for ``3.1 percent'' 
        each place it appears in subsections (a)(2) and (b).

            (2) Transfers to social security equivalent benefit 
        account.--There are hereby appropriated to the Social Security

        reason of the application of subsection (a)(2). Amounts 
        appropriated by the preceding sentence shall be transferred 
        from the general fund at such times and in such manner as to

                            (i) In the case of the financial plan and 
                        budget for the first fiscal year of a control

            (3) Contracts subject to legislative assembly approval.--In 
        the case of a contract or lease that is required to be 
        submitted to the Authority under this subsection and is subject 
        to approval by the Legislative Assembly under the laws of the 
        Commonwealth, the Governor shall submit the contract or lease

        variance with the financial plan and budget, unless--
                    (A) the Authority determines to be reasonable and 
                appropriate, taking into account the terms of the 
                financial plan and budget--

                        Commonwealth government to correct the 
                        inconsistency; and
                    (B) the Governor agrees to submit the reports

                year as approved by the Authority under section 324 as 
                a result of the terms and conditions of the budget of 
                the Commonwealth government for the control year or as 
                a result of any law enacted by Congress that affects

                Governor a notification of the determination.
                    (B) Certification.--In the case of an inconsistency

                Secretary, and Congress that the Commonwealth 
                government is at variance with the financial plan and 
                budget unless the Commonwealth government adopts or 
                implements a remedial action (including revising the 
                financial plan and budget pursuant to section 
                324(b)(5)) to correct the inconsistency that the

                reserve fund due to the investment of funds in the debt 
                service reserve fund (to the extent the transfer does 
                not reduce the amount of the debt service reserve fund 
                below the minimum reserve fund requirement established 
                for the debt service reserve fund) for such purposes as

    The Authority may not issue bonds, notes, or other obligations 
pursuant to this part that are secured in whole or in part by a debt 
service reserve fund established under section 333 if issuance of the

below the minimum reserve requirement for the debt service reserve 
fund, unless the Authority, on issuance of the bonds, deposits in the 
debt service reserve fund an amount (from the proceeds of the bonds to 
be issued or from other sources) that, when added to the amount already
