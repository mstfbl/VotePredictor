               TITLE VII--VESSEL INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''.

SEC. 702. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the enactment of the Act to Prevent Pollution 
        from Ships (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980, the United States 
        Coast Guard has been the principal Federal authority charged 
        with administering, enforcing, and prescribing regulations 
        relating to the discharge of pollutants from vessels engaged in 
        maritime commerce and transportation.
            (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 
        12,000,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 
        commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges 
        operating in United States waters.
            (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the 
        normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from 
        otherwise applicable permitting requirements.
            (4) During the 32 years during which this regulatory 
        exemption was in effect, Congress enacted several statutes to 
        deal with the regulation of discharges incidental to the normal 
        operation of a vessel, including--
                    (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 
                U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980;
                    (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention 
                and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.);
                    (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 
                Stat. 4073);
                    (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization 
                Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the 
                Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 
                U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and 
                permanent requirements, respectively, for the 
                regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo 
                residue;
                    (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the 
                Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), 
                which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges 
                in certain areas of Alaska;
                    (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation 
                Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which 
                established requirements for the regulation of vessel 
                discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in 
                the form of hold washings;
                    (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 
                2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the 
                implementation of the International Convention on the 
                Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001; 
                and
                    (H) the amendment made by section 2 of the Clean 
                Boating Act of 2008 adding subsection (r) to section 
                402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
                U.S.C. 1342(r)), which exempts recreational vessels 
                from National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System 
                permit requirements.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for the 
establishment of nationally uniform and environmentally sound standards

                        before the implementation deadline under 
                        paragraph (3) with respect to a class of 
                        vessels, the Secretary shall accelerate the 
                        implementation deadline for that class of 
                        vessels. If the implementation deadline under 
                        paragraph (3) is accelerated, the Secretary 
                        shall provide not less than 24 months notice 
                        before the accelerated deadline takes effect.
            (3) Implementation deadline.--The revised ballast water 
        discharge standard under paragraph (1) shall apply to a vessel 
        beginning on the date of the first drydocking of the vessel on 
        or after January 1, 2024, but not later than December 31, 2026.
            (4) Revised discharge standard compliance deadlines.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary may establish a 
                compliance deadline for compliance by a vessel (or a 
                class, type, or size of vessel) with a revised ballast 
                water discharge standard under this subsection.
                    (B) Process for granting extensions.--In issuing 
                regulations under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
                establish a process for an owner or operator to submit 
                a petition to the Secretary for an extension of a 
                compliance deadline with respect to the vessel of the 
                owner or operator.
                    (C) Period of extensions.--An extension issued 
                under subparagraph (B) may be for a period of not to 
                exceed 18 months from the date of the applicable 
                deadline under subparagraph (A) and may be renewed for 
                additional periods of not to exceed 18 months each, 
                except that the total period of extension may not 
                exceed 5 years.
                    (D) Factors.--In issuing a compliance deadline or 
                reviewing a petition under this paragraph, the 
                Secretary shall consider, with respect to the ability 
                of an owner or operator to meet a compliance deadline, 
                the following factors:
                            (i) Whether the management system to be 
                        installed is available in sufficient quantities 
                        to meet the compliance deadline.
                            (ii) Whether there is sufficient shipyard 
                        or other installation facility capacity.

                        room size, layout, or a lack of installed 
                        piping.
                            (v) Electric power generating capacity 
                        aboard the vessel.
                            (vi) Safety of the vessel and crew.
                            (vii) Any other factors the Secretary 
                        considers appropriate, including the 
                        availability of a ballast water reception 
                        facility or other means of managing ballast 
                        water.
                    (E) Consideration of petitions.--
                            (i) Determinations.--The Secretary shall 
                        approve or deny a petition for an extension of 
                        a compliance deadline submitted by an owner or 
                        operator under this paragraph.
                            (ii) Deadline.--If the Secretary does not 
                        approve or deny a petition referred to in 
                        clause (i) on or before the last day of the 90-
                        day period beginning on the date of submission 
                        of the petition, the petition shall be deemed 
                        approved.
    (c) Future Revisions of Vessel Incidental Discharge Standards; 
Decennial Reviews.--
            (1) Revised ballast water discharge standards.--The 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, shall 
        complete a review, 10 years after the issuance of a final rule 
        under subsection (b) and every 10 years thereafter, to 
        determine whether further revision of the ballast water 
        discharge standard would result in a scientifically 
        demonstrable and substantial reduction in the risk of the 
        introduction or establishment of aquatic nuisance species.
            (2) Revised standards for discharges other than ballast 
        water.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, 
        may include in a decennial review under this subsection best 
        management practices for discharges (including practices, 
        limitations, or concentrations) covered by subsection (a)(2). 
        The Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to revise 1 or more 
        best management practices for such discharges after a decennial 
        review if the Secretary, in consultation with the 
        Administrator, determines that revising 1 or more of such 
        practices would substantially reduce the impacts on navigable 
        waters of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a 
        vessel other than ballast water.
            (3) Considerations.--In conducting a review under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary, the Administrator, and the heads of other 
        Federal agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, shall 
        consider the criteria under section 705(b)(2)(B).
            (4) Revision after decennial review.--The Secretary shall 
        initiate a rulemaking to revise the current ballast water 
        discharge standard after a decennial review if the Secretary, 
        in consultation with the Administrator, determines that 
        revising the current ballast water discharge standard would 
        result in a scientifically demonstrable and substantial 
        reduction in the risk of the introduction or establishment of 
        aquatic nuisance species.
    (d) Alternative Ballast Water Management Requirements.--Nothing in 
this title may be construed to preclude the Secretary from authorizing 
the use of alternate means or methods of managing ballast water 
(including flow-through exchange, empty/refill exchange, and transfer 
to treatment facilities in place of a vessel ballast water management 
system required under this section) if the Secretary, in consultation 
with the Administrator, determines that such means or methods would not 
pose a greater risk of introduction of aquatic nuisance species in 
navigable waters than the use of a ballast water management system that 
achieves the applicable ballast water discharge standard.
    (e) Great Lakes Requirements.--In addition to the other standards 
and requirements imposed by this section, in the case of a vessel that 
enters the Great Lakes through the St. Lawrence River after operating 
outside the exclusive economic zone of the United States the Secretary, 
in consultation with the Administrator, shall establish a requirement 
that the vessel conduct saltwater flushing of all ballast water tanks 
onboard prior to entry.
