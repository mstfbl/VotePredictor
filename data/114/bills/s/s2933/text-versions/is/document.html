SEC. 2. PREVENTION OF CERTAIN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS FROM PROVIDING NON-
              DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO VETERANS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall deny or 
revoke the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non-
Department health care services to veterans if the Secretary determines 
that--
            (1) the health care provider was removed from employment 
        with the Department of Veterans Affairs due to conduct that 
        violated a policy of the Department;
            (2) the health care provider violated the requirements of a 
        medical license of the health care provider;
            (3) the health care provider had a Department certification 
        revoked; or
            (4) the health care provider violated a law for which a 
        term of imprisonment of more than one year may be imposed.
    (b) Permissive Action.--The Secretary may deny, revoke, or suspend 
the eligibility of a health care provider to provide non-Department 
health care services if the Secretary has reasonable belief that such 
action is necessary to immediately protect the health, safety, or 
welfare of veterans and--
            (1) the health care provider is under investigation by the 
        medical board of a State in which the health care provider is 
        licensed or practices;
            (2) the health care provider has entered into a settlement 
        agreement for a disciplinary charge relating to the practice of 
        medicine by the health care provider; or
            (3) the Secretary otherwise determines that such action is 
        appropriate under the circumstances.
    (c) Suspension.--The Secretary shall suspend the eligibility of a 
health care provider to provide non-Department health care services to 
veterans if the health care provider is suspended from serving as a 
health care provider of the Department.
    (d) Non-Department Health Care Services Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``non-Department health care services'' means--
            (1) services provided under subchapter I of chapter 17 of 
        title 38, United States Code, at non-Department facilities (as 
        defined in section 1701 of such title);
            (2) services provided under section 101 of the Veterans 
        Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-
        146; 38 U.S.C. 1701 note);
            (3) services purchased through the Medical Community Care 
        account of the Department; or
            (4) services purchased with amounts deposited in the 
        Veterans Choice Fund under section 802 of the Veterans Access, 
        Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014.
