            (2) establish clear timelines for the review and 
        coordination of electric transmission infrastructure projects 
        by the applicable agencies;
            (3) ensure that each electric transmission infrastructure 
        project is posted on the Federal permitting transmission 
        tracking system known as ``e-Trans'', including information on 
        the status and anticipated completion date of each project; and
            (4) regularly notify all participating members of the Team
