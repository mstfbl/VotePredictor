                mobilize followers to violence and to address the 
                conditions that allow for violent extremist recruitment 
                and radicalization; and
                    (B) do not include disruptive actions that focus on 
                stopping acts of terrorism by individuals who have 
                already subscribed to violence.
            (4) CVE lab.--The term ``CVE Lab'' means a physical space 
        and academic program at a center for homeland security

            (7) Technology-based cve solution.--The term ``technology-
        based CVE solution'' means an instrument developed by a 
        participating student under section 5(b)(1) that--
                    (A) appeals to young consumers of online and social 
                media;
                    (B) counters online recruitment of violent 
                extremists or builds resilience against online 
                extremist recruitment amongst participating students' 
                peers; and
                    (C) operates on a technological platform or is 
                technological in nature, including social media 
                campaigns and mobile software applications.
            (8) Violent extremism.--The term ``violent extremism'' 
        means ideologically motivated international terrorism or 
        domestic terrorism, as those terms are defined in section 2331 
        of title 18, United States Code.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) The ability to rapidly disseminate graphic images and 
        ideas to shape the public narrative makes social media a 
        strategic messaging and recruitment mechanism for terrorists, 
        insurgent groups, and governments engaged in conflict.
            (2) The United States Government and its partners around 
        the world have not been effective in using social media to 
        produce alternative narratives to stem terrorist recruitment 
        through social media.
            (3) Due to the strategic role the Internet plays in 
        recruitment to terrorist violence, online counter-narratives 
        promoted by non-governmental peers are most likely to directly 
        reach and resonate with individuals who aspire to become 
        foreign fighters or carry out terrorist attacks.
            (4) There exists youth-led demand for action-oriented 
        solutions to countering violent extremism, as evidenced by the 
        Youth Action Agenda to Prevent Violent Extremism and Promote 
        Peace, which was produced by young activists at the Global 
        Youth Summit Against Violent Extremism on the margins of the 
        70th United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, on 
        September 28, 2015.
            (5) The establishment of university-based labs for students 
        to develop technology-based solutions will enable more 
        innovative and effective alternative narratives to counter 
        violent extremist recruitment online.

SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF CVE LABS.

    In carrying out clause (xv) of section 308(b)(2)(B) of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 188(b)(2)(B)), as added by section 7, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary 
for Science and Technology and in coordination with the office within
