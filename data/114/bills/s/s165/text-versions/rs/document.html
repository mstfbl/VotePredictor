        individual detained at Guantanamo to the custody or control of 
        the individual's country of origin, any other foreign country, 
        or any other foreign entity if there is a confirmed case of any 
        individual who was detained at United States Naval Station, 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at any time after September 11, 2001, who 
        was transferred to such foreign country or entity and 
        subsequently engaged in any terrorist activity.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Exception.--Subject to subsection (e),

        effectuate an order affecting the disposition of the individual 
        that is issued by a court or competent tribunal of the United 
        States having lawful jurisdiction (which the Secretary shall 
        notify the appropriate committees of Congress of promptly after 
        issuance).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) National Security Waiver.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (e), the 
        Secretary of Defense may waive the applicability to a detainee 
        transfer of a certification requirement specified in 
        subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1) or the prohibition 
        in subsection (c), if the Secretary certifies the rest of the 
        criteria required by subsection (b) for transfers prohibited by 
        subsection (c) and, with the concurrence of the Secretary of 
        State and in consultation with the Director of National 
        Intelligence, determines that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) alternative actions will be taken to 
                address the underlying purpose of the requirement or 
                requirements to be waived;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in the case of a waiver of 
                subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1), it is not 
                possible to certify that the risks addressed in the 
                paragraph to be waived have been completely eliminated, 
                but the actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate such risks with regard to the 
                individual to be transferred;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection 
                (c), the Secretary has considered any confirmed case in 
                which an individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) the transfer is in the national 
                security interests of the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Reports.--Whenever the Secretary makes a 
        determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit 
        to the appropriate committees of Congress, not later than 30 
        days before the transfer of the individual concerned, the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) A copy of the determination and the 
                waiver concerned.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) A statement of the basis for the 
                determination, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) an explanation why the 
                        transfer is in the national security interests 
                        of the United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) in the case of a waiver of 
                        paragraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1), an 
                        explanation why it is not possible to certify 
                        that the risks addressed in the paragraph to be 
                        waived have been completely eliminated; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) a classified summary of--
                        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) the individual's 
                                record of cooperation while in the 
                                custody of or under the effective 
                                control of the Department of Defense; 
                                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (II) the agreements and 
                                mechanisms in place to provide for 
                                continuing cooperation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) A summary of the alternative actions 
                to be taken to address the underlying purpose of, and 
                to mitigate the risks addressed in, the paragraph or

individual detained at Guantanamo will engage in terrorist activity or 
other actions that could affect the security of the United States if 
released for the purpose of making a certification under subsection (b)

        the individual's country of origin, any other foreign country,

        of a certification requirement specified in subparagraph (D) or 
        (E) of subsection (b)(1) or the prohibition in subsection (c), 
        if the Secretary certifies the rest of the criteria required by 
        subsection (b) for transfers prohibited by subsection (c) and, 
        with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in 
        consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, 
        determines that--
                    (A) alternative actions will be taken to address 
                the underlying purpose of the requirement or 
                requirements to be waived;
                    (B) in the case of a waiver of subparagraph (D) or 
                (E) of subsection (b)(1), it is not possible to certify 
                that the risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                have been completely eliminated, but the actions to be 
                taken under subparagraph (A) will substantially 
                mitigate such risks with regard to the individual to be 
                transferred;
                    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection (c), the 
                Secretary has considered any confirmed case in which an 
                individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and
                    (D) the transfer is in the national security 
                interests of the United States.
            (2) Reports.--Whenever the Secretary makes a determination 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the

        before the transfer of the individual concerned, the following:

                concerned.

                including--
                            (i) an explanation why the transfer is in 
                        the national security interests of the United 
                        States;
                            (ii) in the case of a waiver of paragraph 
                        (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1), an explanation 
                        why it is not possible to certify that the 
                        risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                        have been completely eliminated; and

                                Department of Defense; and

                    (C) A summary of the alternative actions to be 
                taken to address the underlying purpose of, and to 
                mitigate the risks addressed in, the paragraph or
