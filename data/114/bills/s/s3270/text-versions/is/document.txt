     TITLE III--ENHANCED VICTIM ASSISTANCE TO ELDER ABUSE SURVIVORS

SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:
            (1) The vast majority of cases of abuse, neglect, and 
        exploitation of older adults in the United States go 
        unidentified and unreported.
            (2) Not less than $2,900,000,000 is taken from older adults 
        each year due to financial abuse and exploitation.
            (3) Elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation have no 
        boundaries and cross all racial, social, class, gender, and 
        geographic lines.
            (4) Older adults who are abused are 3 times more likely to 
        die earlier than older adults of the same age who are not 
        abused.
            (5) Up to half of all older adults with dementia will 
        experience abuse.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that --
            (1) elder abuse involves the exploitation of potentially 
        vulnerable individuals with devastating physical, mental, 
        emotional, and financial consequences to the victims and their 
        loved ones;
            (2) to combat this affront to America's seniors, we must do 
        everything possible to both support victims of elder abuse and 
        prevent the abuse from occurring in the first place; and
            (3) the Senate supports a multipronged approach to prevent 
        elder abuse and exploitation, protect the victims of elder 
        abuse and exploitation from further harm, and bring the 
        perpetrators of such crimes to justice.

SEC. 302. REPORT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime shall

addresses, to the extent data is available, the nature, extent, and 
amount of funding under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 
10601 et seq.) for victims of crime who are elders.
    (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a) shall

            (1) an analysis of victims' assistance, victims' 
        compensation, and discretionary grants under which elder abuse

        exploitation, and fraud) received assistance; and
