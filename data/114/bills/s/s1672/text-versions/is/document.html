                     commercial driver's licenses.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Driver Act''.

SEC. 2. INTERSTATE COMPACT TEST PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration shall establish a test program to allow States 
and the District of Columbia to enter into interstate compacts with 
contiguous States to standardize the requirements for drivers operating 
commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce.
    (b) Mutual Recognition of Licenses.--A commercial driver's licenses 
issued by 1 State participating in an interstate compact under 
subsection (a) shall be recognized as valid in every State that is 
participating in such compact.
    (c) Standards.--In developing an interstate compact under this 
section, participating States shall provide for minimum licensure 
standards acceptable for interstate travel under this section, which 
may include, for drivers under the 21 years of age--
            (1) age restrictions;
            (2) distance from origin (measured in air miles);
            (3) reporting requirements; or
            (4) additional hours of service restrictions.

SEC. 3. APPROVAL.

    An interstate compact described in section 2 may not go into effect 
until it has been approved by the governor of each State (or the Mayor 
of the District of Columbia, if applicable) that is a party to the 
agreement, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and 
the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

SEC. 4. SAVINGS PROVISION.

    Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit, or otherwise change, 
the authority to operate in Interstate Commerce for drivers over the 
age of 21, including by setting the minimum age requirement to receive 
a Class A commercial driver's license at 18 years of age.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
