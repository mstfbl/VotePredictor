                determined that--
                            (i) the employer has established the need

                United States visas at such consulate.
            (2) Prohibition on certain reductions.--The Secretary may 
        not reduce the number of positions an employer will receive 
        pursuant to a petition that the Secretary accepts pursuant to 
        this subsection because the employer hires or offers employment 
        to a United States worker for the position before the date on 
        which the employer indicated in the petition that workers were 
        needed to begin work.
            (3) Conditional approval.--Once the Secretary determines 
        that a sufficient number of petitions for H-2B nonimmigrants 
        have been received to result in a likely fulfillment of the 
        statutory cap, the Secretary shall continue to receive such 
        petitions for that fiscal year and issue conditional approvals, 
        unless the beneficiaries for visas for H-2B nonimmigrants are 
        not subject to the statutory cap, in which event the Secretary

                fee submitted for a premium processing petition for a 
                fiscal year that was submitted after the date the 
                Secretary determines that the statutory cap has been 
                met for that fiscal year.

SEC. 9. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    The benefits and wages provided to an H-2B nonimmigrant, the 
services an H-2B nonimmigrant provides to the employer, the employment 
opportunities afforded to an H-2B nonimmigrant by the employer, 
including those employment opportunities that require a United States 
worker or an H-2B nonimmigrant to travel or relocate in order to accept 
or perform employment, and other terms or conditions of the employment 
of an H-2B nonimmigrant provided for under this Act, or the amendments 
made by this Act, are not primarily for the benefit of either the H-2B 
nonimmigrant or the employer and are for the equal mutual benefit for 
the H-2B worker and the employer.
