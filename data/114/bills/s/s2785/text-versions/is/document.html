                                 A BILL

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Youth and Community 
Protection Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) children in Indian country should be protected from 
        violence;
            (2) tribal communities should be able to protect themselves 
        from offenders bringing illegal drugs onto Indian reservations;
            (3) violence against children and crime associated with 
        illegal drugs increase the number of instances of trauma in 
        tribal communities, which--
                    (A) affects health outcomes;
                    (B) reduces educational attainment;
                    (C) hinders economic growth; and
                    (D) undermines public safety;
            (4) Congress established the Indian Law and Order 
        Commission to advise the Federal Government on how to improve 
        criminal justice in Indian country;
            (5) the Indian Law and Order Commission issued a report 
        entitled ``A Roadmap for Making Native America Safer''--
                    (A) which recommends the restoration of the 
                inherent authority of tribal courts; and
                    (B) on which the Committee on Indian Affairs of the 
                Senate, on February 12, 2014, held an oversight hearing 
                and received testimony; and
            (6) recognition of the inherent authority of Indian tribes 
        to protect Native children from violence, and tribal 
        communities from illegal drugs, will reduce instances of trauma 
        experienced by Indians.
