    (e) Identification of Inconsistent Interpretations of Policies 
Across Review Entities.--Not later than January 1, 2017, the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services shall establish and implement a process 
for identifying policies or coverage determinations relating to title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act that are most frequently interpreted 
and applied differently by review entities, Medicare magistrates, 
administrative law judges, or the Department Appeals Board of the 
Department of Health and Human Services. As a part of such process, the 
Secretary shall, where appropriate, issue guidance or take other 
administrative action to clarify how a policy or coverage decision 
should be interpreted in order to prevent future conflicting 
interpretations.
    (f) Study and Report on Administrative Law Judge Specialization.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        shall conduct a study to determine if the specialization of 
        administrative law judges within the Office of Medicare 
        Hearings and Appeals by type of appeal would lead to more 
        consistent decisions by administrative law judges determining 
        cases with similar facts.
            (2) Report.--Not later than January 1, 2018, the Secretary 
        of Health and Human services shall submit to Congress a report 
        containing the results of the study required under paragraph
