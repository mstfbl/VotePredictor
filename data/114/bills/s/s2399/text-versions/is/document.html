SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) greenhouse gases are accumulating in the atmosphere at 
        a rate that may cause average temperatures to rise 8 degrees 
        Fahrenheit or more;
            (2) the expected rise in average temperatures poses a risk 
        of--
                    (A) increasing global average air and ocean 
                temperatures;
                    (B) widespread melting of snow and ice; and
                    (C) rising global average sea level;
            (3) the overwhelming majority of the scientific community 
        is clear that climate change is--
                    (A) real;
                    (B) caused by human activity; and
                    (C) already causing devastating problems in the 
                United States and around the world; and
            (4) mandatory steps will be required to move aggressively 
        to transform the energy system of the United States away from 
        fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to reduce, in conjunction with other laws, emissions of 
        carbon pollution to ensure that the contribution of the United 
        States to global climate change is lower than the level 
        required to keep global average temperature increases below 2 
        degrees Celsius;
            (2) to implement solutions that acknowledge the 
        intersections of environmental degradation that perpetuate 
        racial, social, and economic inequities;
            (3) to protect the lives of low-income, minority, and 
        tribal communities and reinvest in those communities;
            (4) to empower communities to prepare for, and react to, 
        the impacts of climate change that are already being 
        experienced by communities; and
            (5) to demonstrate to the international community a 
        commitment by the Government of the United States to 
        aggressively reduce carbon pollution emissions.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States that--
            (1) the Government of the United States should lead the 
        international community in an aggressive transition away from 
        fossil fuels and toward sustainable energy;
            (2) the Government of the United States should tax carbon 
        pollution to capture the price on the atmosphere and motivate 
        significant reductions in emissions; and
            (3) the transition away from fossil fuels shall focus on 
        climate justice, which requires solutions that consider--
                    (A) the needs of workers; and
                    (B) the manners in which the causes and effects of 
                climate change disproportionately impact low-income and 
                minority communities.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that Congress agrees with the opinion 
of virtually the entire worldwide scientific community that--
            (1) climate change is real;
            (2) climate change is caused by human activities;
            (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems 
        in the United States and around the world;
            (4) a brief window of opportunity exists before the United 
        States and the entire planet suffer irreparable harm; and
            (5) it is imperative that the United States transform the 
        energy system of the United States away from fossil fuels and 
        toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as 
        possible.

                            (i) in the case of an eligible taxpayer who 
                        filed a joint return, $10,000,
                            (ii) in the case of an eligible taxpayer 
                        who filed as a head of household, $8,000, and
                            (iii) in the case of any other eligible

 TITLE II--PROTECTING VULNERABLE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES FROM THE 
                       IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

              Subtitle A--Ensuring Climate Justice for All

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) minority and low-income communities in the United 
        States are disproportionately affected by the causes of climate 
        change because--
                    (A) according to a 2012 study by the National 
                Association for the Advancement of Colored People--
                            (i) the nearly 6,000,000 people in the 
                        United States who live within 3 miles of a coal 
                        power plant have an average per capita annual 
                        income of $18,400, which is lower than the 
                        national average of $21,587; and
                            (ii) among the people who live within 3 
                        miles of a coal power plant, 39 percent are 
                        people of color, while people of color comprise 
                        only 36 percent of the total population of the 
                        United States;
                    (B) 82.3 percent of Native Americans and Alaska 
                Natives live within 50 miles of major sources of NO and 
                NO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; and 65.8 percent of Native Americans and 
                Alaska Natives live within 25 miles of PM-10 point 
                sources; and
                    (C) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                has found that--
                            (i) African-Americans are 2 to 3 times more 
                        likely to die from asthma than any other racial 
                        or ethnic group;
                            (ii) African-American and Hispanic children 
                        visit emergency departments for asthma care 
                        more often than Caucasian children;
                            (iii) more than 1 in 4 African-American 
                        adults cannot afford routine doctor visits;
                            (iv) nearly 1 in 7 Hispanic adults cannot 
                        afford routine doctor visits;
                            (v) Hispanic individuals are 30 percent 
                        more likely to visit the hospital for asthma; 
                        and
                            (vi) Hispanic children are 40 percent more 
                        likely to die from asthma than Caucasian 
                        children; and
            (2) minority and low-income people of the United States are 
        disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change 
        because--
                    (A) hurricanes disproportionately impact low-income 
                and minority communities, and regarding Hurricane 
                Katrina in 2005--
                            (i) after the hurricane, people of color 
                        were much less likely to return to the homes in 
                        New Orleans from which those individuals were 
                        evacuated;
                            (ii) according to the Bureau of Labor and 
                        Statistics, only 54 percent of African-
                        Americans who were evacuated during Hurricane 
                        Katrina returned to New Orleans, compared to 82 
                        percent of Caucasian evacuees;
                            (iii) the damage occurred in areas--
                                    (I) with populations that were 45.8 
                                percent African-American, compared to 
                                undamaged areas with populations that 
                                were 26.4 percent African-American; and
                                    (II) in which 20.9 percent of the 
                                households had incomes below the 
                                poverty line, compared to undamaged 
                                areas in which 15.3 percent of the 
                                households had incomes below the 
                                poverty line;
                            (iv) African-Americans are estimated to 
                        have accounted for approximately 44 percent of 
                        the Hurricane Katrina victims;
                            (v) \1/5\ of the individuals displaced by 
                        Hurricane Katrina were likely to have been 
                        poor, and 30 percent of those individuals had 
                        incomes that were below 150 percent of the 
                        poverty line; and
                            (vi) nearly \1/2\ of all individuals aged 
                        65 or older who live in flooded or damage-
                        affected areas report having a disability, and 
                        26 percent of those individuals report having 2 
                        or more types of disabilities;
                    (B) extreme weather disproportionately impacts low-
                income and minority communities, and regarding 
                Hurricane Sandy in 2012--
                            (i) 80,000 residents living in low-income 
                        housing lost power, heat, and hot water for 
                        more than 2 weeks in the middle of winter;
                            (ii) 1 in 5 public housing units and almost 
                        1 in 7 affordable rental housing units were 
                        damaged;
                            (iii) in contrast to the effects of 
                        Hurricane Sandy on low-income communities, Wall 
                        Street went back to business with the lights on 
                        and stock tickers running only 2 days after 
                        Hurricane Sandy hit New York City;
                            (iv) 55 percent of the victims of Hurricane 
                        Sandy in New York City were very-low-income 
                        renters, with incomes that averaged $18,000 per 
                        year;
                            (v) 67 percent of recipients of assistance 
                        from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
                        were low-income individuals; and
                            (vi) the median rent paid by households 
                        affected by Hurricane Sandy has increased $200 
                        per month since the date Hurricane Sandy hit 
                        New York City;
                    (C) heat waves disproportionately impact low-income 
                and minority communities because--
                            (i) African-Americans are 52 percent more 
                        likely than Caucasians to live in dense, urban 
                        neighborhoods that may be 22 degrees Fahrenheit 
                        hotter than rural neighborhoods, which 
                        increases the risk of health complications for 
                        African-Americans, including death from heat-
                        related complications;
                            (ii) although access to air conditioning 
                        lowers the risk of mortality from heat-related 
                        health complications by 80 percent, 1 in 5 low-
                        income households has no access to air 
                        conditioning;
                            (iii) in 2011 and 2012, drought and heat 
                        waves affected communities with median incomes 
                        that were 5 percent lower than the national 
                        average;
                            (iv) heat waves--
                                    (I) cause more deaths in the United 
                                States than all other weather events 
                                combined; and
                                    (II) are particularly dangerous for 
                                Hispanic people, who are 
                                disproportionately likely to have low 
                                incomes;
                            (v) the number of unhealthy ``red alert'' 
                        air quality days in more than 12 cities in the 
                        eastern United States--
                                    (I) will likely double due to 
                                increased ozone formation caused by 
                                rising temperatures; and
                                    (II) will increase rates of asthma 
                                complications for Hispanic people, who 
                                are also at risk for cardiovascular 
                                conditions; and
                            (vi) by the end of the 21st century, 
                        climate change is projected to triple the 
                        average number of extremely hot days in the 
                        United States, the consequences of which--
                                    (I) include--
                                            (aa) thousands of premature 
                                        deaths annually by 2100;
                                            (bb) nearly 2,000,000,000 
                                        lost labor hours per year; and
                                            (cc) over $100,000,000,000 
                                        in lost wages annually; and
                                    (II) disproportionately burden 
                                Hispanic people, who comprise--
                                            (aa) 42 percent of 
                                        construction laborers; and
                                            (bb) approximately 75 
                                        percent of agricultural field 
                                        workers;
                    (D) floods disproportionately impact low-income and 
                minority communities, for example--
                            (i) in 2011 and 2012, floods affected 
                        communities with median incomes that were 14 
                        percent lower than the national average; and
                            (ii) in June 2011, extreme Missouri River 
                        rain runoff hit record highs and caused 
                        $1,500,000,000 in damages, including damages in 
                        communities in Arkansas and Mississippi with 
                        median incomes that were 23 percent and 30 
                        percent lower, respectively, than the national 
                        average;
                    (E) tornadoes disproportionately impact low-income 
                and minority communities--
                            (i) because even though mobile homes 
                        comprise only 8 percent of housing in the 
                        United States, \1/2\ of all fatalities during 
                        tornadoes are fatalities of individuals who 
                        reside in mobile homes; and
                            (ii) with the deadliest tornado in the 
                        history of the United States having occurred in 
                        Joplin, Missouri, a community with--
                                    (I) a median income that is 29 
                                percent lower than the national 
                                average; and
                                    (II) a 20-percent poverty rate;
                    (F) wildfires disproportionately impact low-income 
                and minority communities, for example--
                            (i) the Ash Creek Fire devastated an Indian 
                        reservation on which--
                                    (I) \1/3\ of the families live 
                                below the poverty line; and
                                    (II) \2/3\ of the adults are

                        prices of fruits and vegetables by roughly 3 
                        percent in 2015, which increases the economic

                        percent identify as Latino and \3/4\ earn less 
                        than 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, 
                        are projected to experience significant

                        Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452)) within the 
                        Colorado River watershed, which is predicted to 
                        be reduced by approximately 45 percent by 2050; 
                        and
                            (iv) approximately 30 percent of the people

                                due to worsening droughts caused by 
                                climate change; and
                    (H)(i) sea level rise and erosion 
                disproportionately impact low-income and minority 
                communities;
                    (ii) in 2008, the Comptroller General of the United 
                States found that more than 86 percent of the 216 
                Alaska Native villages are already subject to flooding 
                and erosion caused by increasing temperatures due to 
                climate change; and
                    (iii) the land under the village of Newtok, Alaska, 
                is eroding at the rate of 72 feet per year, which may 
                require the village to move.

SEC. 301. CARBON EQUIVALENCY FEE BORDER ADJUSTMENTS FOR CARBON 
              POLLUTION-INTENSIVE GOODS.

    (a) In General.--There is imposed on each person importing a carbon 
pollution-intensive good into the United States a fee in an amount that 
is equal to the cost that a producer of a good that is comparable to 
the carbon pollution-intensive good (as determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the Administrator, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Energy) and is produced in the United 
States incurs as a result of--
            (1) any fee imposed under section 196 of the Clean Air Act, 
        as added by section 101 of this Act--
                    (A) paid by the producer of the comparable good 
                with respect to a carbon-polluting substance used in 
                the production of the comparable good; or
                    (B) paid by a person that imported a carbon-
                polluting substance used in the production of the 
                comparable good; and
            (2) any fee imposed under this subsection paid by a person 
        that imported a carbon pollution-intensive good that was used 
        in the production of the comparable good.
    (b) Determination of Fee Amount.--
            (1) In general.--In determining the amount of the fee 
        imposed under subsection (a) with respect to a carbon 
        pollution-intensive good, the Secretary of the Treasury shall--
                    (A) determine the amount of the fee annually; and
                    (B) determine different amounts for such goods--
                            (i) based on class of good and country of 
                        origin; and
                            (ii) taking into account the quantity of 
                        greenhouse gas emissions released during the 
                        process of manufacturing such goods and 
                        transporting such goods from the country of 
                        origin to the United States.
            (2) Petitions for adjustment.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury shall establish a process for petitioning for 
        adjustment of the fee imposed under subsection (a).
    (c) Termination.--The fee imposed under subsection (a) shall cease 
to apply with respect to goods imported from a country at such time as, 
and to the extent that--
            (1)(A) in the case of a country that adopts and ratifies an 
        international agreement requiring countries that emit 
        greenhouse gases and produce carbon pollution-intensive goods 
        for exportation to adopt substantially equivalent measures, 
        that agreement takes effect; or
            (B) in the case of a country that has not adopted and 
        ratified such an agreement, the country has implemented 
        substantially equivalent measures, as determined by the 
        President; and
            (2) the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the 
        application of the fee with respect to imports from that 
        country is no longer appropriate.
    (d) Regulations.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Administrator, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of 
Energy, shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out 
this section.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``carbon pollution-
intensive good'' and ``substantially equivalent measure'' have the 
meanings given those terms in section 194 of the Clean Air Act, as 
added by section 101 of this Act.

SEC. 403. NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) fertilizer is a significant cost input in many 
        agricultural operations;
            (2) opportunities exist for agricultural producers--
                    (A) to reduce the amount of fertilizer inputs; and
                    (B) to increase the efficiency of fertilizer use 
                through the development of more effective fertilizer 
                application protocols that maximize the uptake of 
                fertilizer by crops while maintaining or increasing 
                yields; and
            (3) improving the application of nitrogen fertilizers at 
        the correct rate, in the correct manner, at the correct time, 
        and in the correct place will provide significant benefits to 
        the environment, including reductions of--
