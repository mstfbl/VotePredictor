        an initial analysis of existing State statutes to determine

        or procedure raises material investigatory issues that could 
        impair or hinder a prompt and thorough investigation of 
        possible misconduct, including criminal conduct, that would 
        justify a wider inquiry.
            (3) Data collection.--After completion of the initial 
        analysis under paragraph (2), and considering material 
        investigatory issues, the Attorney General shall gather 
        additional data nationwide on similar rules from a 
        representative and statistically significant sample of

    (b) Reporting.--
            (1) Initial analysis.--Not later than 120 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall--
