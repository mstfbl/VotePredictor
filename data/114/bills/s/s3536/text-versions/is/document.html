SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) More than 14,000,000 Syrians have become refugees or 
        internally displaced persons over the last five years.
            (2) The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported 
        that since 2012, more than 60,000 Syrians, including children, 
        have died in Syrian prisons.
            (3) In July 2014, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
        House of Representatives heard testimony from a former Syrian 
        military photographer, alias ``Caesar'', who fled Syria and 
        smuggled out thousands of photos of tortured bodies. In 
        testimony, Caesar said, ``I have seen horrendous pictures of 
        bodies of people who had tremendous amounts of torture, deep 
        wounds and burns and strangulation.''.
            (4) The regime of Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly blocked 
        civilian access to or diverted humanitarian assistance, 
        including medical supplies, to besieged and hard-to-reach 
        areas, in violation of United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions.
            (5) The course of the Syrian transition and its future 
        leadership may depend on what the United States and its 
        partners do now to save Syrian lives, alleviate suffering, and 
        help Syrians determine their own future.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the

Council Resolutions regarding the provision of humanitarian assistance 
to the people of Syria and that the Government of the Russian 
Federation is complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Syria because of 
its failure to enforce those Resolutions.
    (b) Authority.--The President is authorized, notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, to furnish, on such terms and conditions as the 
President may determine, assistance in order to--
            (1) provide enhanced support for humanitarian activities 
        taking place in and outside Syria, including the provision of 
        food, shelter, water, health care, and medical supplies;
            (2) support efforts for a peaceful resolution of the 
        conflict in Syria as well as the establishment of an inclusive 
        representative form of government in Syria;
            (3) build the capacity of legitimate local councils and 
        leaders inside Syria to provide basic services to Syrian people 
        in territory liberated from the Islamic State of Iraq and 
        Syria;
            (4) continue to encourage the participation of all groups, 
        including women, business leaders, civil society organizations, 
        traditional and religious leaders, and minority groups in 
        efforts for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and political 
        transition in Syria;
            (5) encourage international bodies to insist that 
        transitional and future governments are committed to multiparty 
        democracy, open and transparent governance, respect for human 
        rights and religious freedom, ending the violence throughout 
        the country, promoting peace and stability with Syria's 
        neighbors, enhancing the rule of law and combating corruption, 
        and rehabilitating and reintegrating former combatants;
            (6) contribute seed funding to establish a Syria 
        Reconstruction Fund, which would leverage contributions from 
        other international donors and be used for the physical 
        reconstruction and reestablishment of basic services in Syria 
        after the cessation of the conflict and the fall of the regime 
        of Bashar al-Assad;
            (7) contribute future capacity building for legitimate 
        governing institutions after a political transition takes place 
        in Syria; and
            (8) expand the public awareness-raising campaign of the 
        United States Government about United States humanitarian 
        assistance efforts through both English-language and regional 
        traditional media sources, as well as social or new media 
        sources.

        available to carry out the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
        U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) for fiscal years 2017 and 2018, such sums 
        as may be necessary should be allocated for bilateral 
        assistance programs in Syria.
            (2) Future funding.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        Department of State should submit a budget request for fiscal 
        year 2018 that contains an appropriate increase in bilateral 
        and multilateral assistance for Syria based on progress toward 
        accomplishing the policy objectives described in subsection 
        (b).
            (3) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the

                for such purposes.
    (d) Coordination With Other Donor Nations.--The United States 
should work with other donor countries, on a bilateral and multilateral 
basis, to increase international contributions to the people of Syria 
and accomplish the policy objectives described in subsection (b).
    (e) Notification Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--In cases where the authority in this 
        section is relied upon to overcome applicable restrictions on 
        the provision of assistance to Syria, obligation of such funds 
        shall be subject to the notification requirement of section 
        634A(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2394-
        1(a)).
            (2) Waiver.--Notification under paragraph (1) may be waived 
        if failure to do so would pose a substantial risk to human 
        health or welfare, in which case notification shall be provided 
        as early as practicable, but in no event later than 3 days 
        after taking the action to which such notification requirement 
        was applicable. The waiver shall be accompanied by an 
        explanation of the emergency circumstances necessitating the

        rights of the people of Syria, specifically--
                    (A) the air space over Syria is no longer being 
                utilized by the Government of Syria and associated

                of incendiary devices, including barrel bombs, chemical 
                weapons, and conventional arms, including air-delivered

                international aid and have regular access to 
                humanitarian assistance, freedom of travel, and medical 
                care;
                    (C) the Government of Syria is releasing all

                facilities maintained by various security, 
                intelligence, and military elements associated with the 
                Government of Syria and allowed full access to the same 
                facilities for investigations by appropriate 
                international human rights organizations; and
                    (D) the forces of the Government of Syria and

                Iranian forces, and air assets of the Government of the 
                Russian Federation, are no longer engaged in deliberate 
                targeting of medical facilities, schools, residential 
                areas, and community gathering places, including 
                markets, in flagrant violation of international norms.

                        committed to negotiations for a transitional 
                        government in Syria and continues to 
                        demonstrate that commitment through sustained 
                        engagement in talks and substantive and 
                        verifiable progress towards the implementation
