 Mr. Markey (for himself and Mr. Rubio) introduced the following bill; 
which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for restrictions related to nuclear cooperation with the 
          People's Republic of China, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``U.S.-China Nuclear Cooperation and 
Nonproliferation Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A 2001 report from the Department of Defense found that 
        ``China supplied Pakistan with nuclear material and expertise 
        and has provided critical assistance in the production of 
        Pakistan's nuclear facilities.'' China is also alleged to have 
        provided Pakistan with 50 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, 
        and designs for a nuclear weapon.
            (2) An unclassified 2011 report to Congress from the 
        Director of National Intelligence found that Chinese entities 
        ``continue to supply a variety of missile-related items to 
        multiple customers, including Iran and Pakistan.'' Previous 
        reports from the Director of National Intelligence have 
        confirmed that Chinese entities have provided support for the 
        missile program of North Korea.
            (3) China has failed to bring to justice Li Fangwei, also 
        known as Karl Lee, who has been indicted in the United States 
        on charges of providing sensitive missile technology to Iran. 
        According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, 
        ``concerns persist about Chinese willingness as well as ability 
        to detect and prevent illicit transfers'' of dual-use and 
        sensitive nuclear and missile items.
            (4) At a May 12, 2015, hearing, members of the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate raised concerns that China may 
        have diverted reactor cooling pumps produced by Curtiss-Wright 
        Corporation to its nuclear submarine program, bolstering the 
        stealth of its submarines, and violating the Previous Nuclear 
        Cooperation Agreement (as that term is defined in section 
        3(3)).
            (5) China has announced plans to provide Pakistan with 
        additional nuclear reactors, beyond those it had already agreed 
        to construct prior to 2004, in violation of its 2004 
        commitments to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).
            (6) Five members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army 
        have been indicted in the United States on charges of hacking 
        into the computer networks of Westinghouse and stealing United 
        States intellectual property, including the design of nuclear 
        power plants.
            (7) China has announced plans to export nuclear power 
        plants based on technology acquired from Westinghouse, one of 
        China's primary commercial partners under its current and 
        previous nuclear cooperation agreements with the United States. 
        While China has committed not to export United States-origin 
        technology without a marketing license from Westinghouse, there 
        is no definition of ``United States-origin technology'' in the 
        Federal Register, complicating United States enforcement of 
        this provision.
            (8) China General Nuclear Power Company, a state-owned 
        nuclear power provider, has been indicted in the United States 
        on charges of unlawfully producing special nuclear material 
        outside the United States without the authorization of the 
        Department of Energy.
            (9) China's plans to reprocess United States-origin spent 
        fuel raise the risk that China could divert plutonium to 
        military purposes, enabling it to produce additional nuclear 
        weapons that threaten the United States and its allies.
            (10) Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, in Beijing on March 
        17, 2016, told the Wall Street Journal that the United States 
        does not ``support large-scale reprocessing'' and China's plan 
        to proceed with a commercial-scale reprocessing facility 
        ``certainly isn't a positive in terms of nonproliferation''.
            (11) China's pursuit of commercial plutonium reprocessing 
        will increase the likelihood that Japan expands its commercial 
        reprocessing program and that South Korea will increase efforts 
        to initiate a similar program of its own. Growing stockpiles of 
        plutonium in East Asia increase the chances of military 
        diversion and theft, raising the risk of nuclear proliferation, 
        nuclear terrorism, and interstate nuclear conflict. It is in 
        the interest of the United States to prevent the stockpiling of 
        plutonium in East Asia.

                        United States-China Nuclear Cooperation 
                        Agreement and nuclear material used in or 
                        produced through the use of such material; and
                            (ii) the transfer to facilities or 
                        locations not agreed to by the United States of 
                        nuclear material transferred pursuant to the 
                        United States-China Nuclear Cooperation 
                        Agreement and nuclear material used in or

            (1) the facility at which the reprocessing, recycling, or 
        other alteration in form and content will take place;
            (2) the safeguards applied to the facility;
            (3) the measures that will be undertaken to secure and 
        prevent the theft or diversion to military purposes of any 
        separated plutonium that will result from the activities at the 
        facility;
            (4) the amounts of materials to be processed at the 
        facility;
            (5) the amount of processed fissile material that might be 
        stockpiled as a result of the activities at the facility, and 
        the estimated time that it may be stockpiled prior to its 
        civilian use in a nuclear reactor; and
            (6) the risks to United States national security posed by 
        the potential diversion of nuclear material at the facility.
