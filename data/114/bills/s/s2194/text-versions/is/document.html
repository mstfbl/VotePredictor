                                 A BILL


 
To promote the use of clean cookstoves and fuels to save lives, improve 
 livelihoods, empower women, and protect the environment by creating a 
   thriving global market for clean and efficient household cooking 
                               solutions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cookstoves and Fuels Support 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nearly one-half of the world's population cooks their 
        food over open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe 
        cookstoves using wood, agricultural waste, dung, coal, or other 
        solid fuels. Smoke from the use of these traditional cookstoves 
        and open fires is associated with a number of chronic and acute 
        diseases and injuries, including respiratory illnesses such as 
        pneumonia, heart disease, and cancer, with women and young 
        children affected disproportionately.
            (2) The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (referred to in 
        this paragraph as the ``Study'') doubled the mortality 
        estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, referred to as 
        ``household air pollution'', from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 deaths 
        annually, which the Study indicates is more than the deaths 
        from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. The Study 
        attributes 3,500,000 deaths to cookstoves smoke exposures 
        indoors and 500,000 deaths to the contribution of cookstoves to 
        outdoor air pollution. Millions more are sickened from the 
        toxic smoke and thousands suffer burns annually from open fires 
        or unsafe cookstoves and fuels. More recently, the World Health 
        Organization found that this type of household air pollution 
        claimed 4,300,000 lives in 2012. The Study ranks household air 
        pollution as the fourth worst overall health risk factor in the 
        world and as the second worst health risk factor in the world 
        for women and girls. Cookstove smoke exposures are particularly 
        prominent in developing regions of Asia and Africa.
            (3) The amount of biomass cooking fuel required each year 
        can reach up to 2 tons per family. Where demand for local 
        biomass outstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local 
        environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity often 
        result.
            (4) Tremendous amounts of time, a burden shouldered 
        disproportionately by women and children, is spent collecting 
        and managing cooking fuel resources. As nearby fuel supplies 
        dwindle, women are forced to go farther to find fuel to cook 
        their families' meals. In some areas, such as conflict zones or 
        refugee camps, women and girls risk rape and gender-based 
        violence during the up to 20 hours per week they spend away 
        from their communities gathering firewood.
            (5) Recent studies show that black carbon created from 
        traditional cookstoves significantly contributes to regional 
        air pollution and climate change. Black carbon emissions from 
        residential cookstoves in developing countries account for an 
        estimated 21 percent of the total global inventory, and 
        mitigation in this sector represents a large potential public 
        health and environmental benefit.
            (6) The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an 
        innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United 
        Nations Foundation that was created to enable the adoption of 
        clean and efficient stoves in 100,000,000 homes by 2020. The 
        Alliance works with public, private, and non-profit partners to 
        overcome market barriers that currently impede the production, 
        deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in the 
        developing world.
            (7) The United States Government has invested more than 
        $114,000,000 to the sector, including approximately $76,000,000 
        in research, $31,000,000 in field implementation activities, 
        and $7,000,000 in financing, through the first 5 years of the 
        Alliance to help spur the adoption of clean cookstoves and 
        fuels in 100,000,000 households by 2020. For the second 5 years 
        of the Alliance, beginning with fiscal year 2016, the United 
        States Government anticipates support of up to $175,000,000 to 
        the sector as follows:
                    (A) $125,000,000 from the United States Agency for 
                International Development.
                    (B) $30,000,000 from the Department of Health and 
                Human Services through the National Institutes of 
                Health.
                    (C) $5,000,000 from the Department of Health and 
                Human Services through the Centers for Disease Control 
                and Prevention.
                    (D) $15,000,000 from the Environmental Protection 
                Agency.
                    (E) The Overseas Private Investment Corporation has 
                renewed its commitment of up to $50,000,000 in debt 
                financing or insurance that meet their credit and 
                lending standards to support projects that provide 
                clean, consistent, and affordable access to energy and 
                energy savings through the manufacture, sale, and 
                purchase of cookstoves.
            (8) This commitment targets a wide range of work, including 
        expanded research on cookstoves performance, marketing, and 
        adoption; expanded research on the health, climate and air 
        quality benefits of clean cookstoves; and expanded field 
        efforts in Kenya, Haiti, Bangladesh, and Nigeria.
            (9) Additional Federal support may be provided to the clean 
        cooking sector, including by the Department of Energy, the 
        Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Peace 
        Corps.
            (10) The Millennium Challenge Corporation, in 2010, prior 
        to the launch of the Alliance, committed the largest stoves-
        related investment to date in Mongolia. The $45,300,000 
        commitment focused on economic growth from energy efficiency 
        and improved air quality.
