        year; and
            ``(16) `revise' means, with respect to an interpretative 
        rule, altering or otherwise changing any provision of a 
        longstanding interpretative rule that conflicts, or is in any 
        way inconsistent with, any provision in a subsequently 
        promulgated interpretative rule.''; and

                interpretative rule of the agency''; and
                    (B) in subsection (d)(2), by striking 
                ``interpretative rules'' and inserting ``an 
                interpretative rule of an agency, unless the 
                interpretative rule revises a longstanding 
                interpretative rule of the agency, and''.
