spill.
    (b) Enhanced Verification of Structural Condition.--The Secretary 
of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall adopt, as

        established by Presidential Proclamation Numbered 5030 of March 
        10, 1983 (16 U.S.C. 1453 note)), in which routing or other 
        navigational measures are warranted to reduce the risk of oil 
        spills and potential damage to natural resources.
            (2) Considerations.--In identifying the areas described in 
        paragraph (1), the Commandant shall give priority consideration 
        to natural resources of particular ecological importance or 
        economic importance, including--

                Estuarine Research Reserve System established by 
                section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 
                (16 U.S.C. 1461); and

                National Park Service Organic Act (16 U.S.C. 1 et 
                seq.).
    (b) Factors Considered.--In determining whether navigational 
measures are warranted for an area identified under subsection (a), the 
Commandant and the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere shall 
consider, at a minimum--
            (1) the frequency of transits of vessels which are required 
        to prepare a response plan under section 311(j) of the Federal 
        Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(j));
            (2) the type and quantity of oil transported as cargo or 
        fuel;
