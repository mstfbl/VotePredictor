                is qualified and that the Secretary determines is 
                appropriate; or
                    ``(B) a reduction in annual rate of pay that the 
                Secretary determines is appropriate.

    ``(2) An individual so demoted may not be placed on administrative 
leave or any other category of paid leave during the period during 
which an appeal (if any) under this section is ongoing, and may only 
receive pay if the individual reports for duty. If an individual so 
demoted does not report for duty, such individual shall not receive pay 
or other benefits pursuant to subsection (e)(5).
    ``(c) Notice to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after removing or 
demoting an individual under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit

Representatives notice in writing of such removal or demotion and the 
reason for such removal or demotion.

paragraph (1) shall be final and shall not be subject to any further 
appeal.
    ``(3) In any case in which the administrative judge cannot issue a 
decision in accordance with the 45-day requirement under paragraph (1), 
the removal or demotion is final. In such a case, the Merit Systems 
Protection Board shall, within 14 days after the date that such removal 
or demotion is final, submit to Congress and the Committees on 
Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report 
that explains the reasons why a decision was not issued in accordance 
with such requirement.
