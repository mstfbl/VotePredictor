information or the right of the student's parent to access or otherwise 
obtain, use, correct, request disclosure of, or request deletion of 
covered information, shall, in the case of covered information about an 
eligible student, be considered to refer to the consent or right of the 
student and not the student's parent.
    (d) No Effect on Consent Under Other Law.--This Act does not modify 
the requirements or standards for consent, including consent from 
minors and employees on behalf of educational institutions, under any

    (a) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        this Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be 
        treated as a violation of a regulation under section 
        18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
        57a(a)(1)(B)) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
            (2) Powers of the commission.--The Commission shall enforce 
        this Act and the regulations promulgated under this Act in the 
        same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
        powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and 
        provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et 
        seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this Act, and 
        any person who violates this Act or a regulation promulgated 
        under this Act shall be subject to the penalties entitled to 
        the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act, except as provided in paragraph (3).
            (3) Enforcement with respect to nonprofit organizations.--
        Notwithstanding sections 4 and 5(a)(2) of the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44; 45(a)(2)), any jurisdictional 
        limitation of the Commission with respect to nonprofit 
        organizations shall not apply for purposes of this Act.
    (b) Preservation of Commission Authority.--Nothing in this Act may 
be construed in any way to limit or affect the Commission's authority 
under any other provision of law.
    (c) Regulations.--The Commission may promulgate regulations under 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to carry out this Act. Such 
regulations shall further define the terms ``targeted advertising'', 
``research, development, and improvement of educational sites, 
services, and applications'', ``advancements in the science of 
learning'', ``postsecondary education or employment opportunities'', 
and ``adaptive or personalized student learning purposes'', as used in 
this Act.
    (d) Consultation and Cooperation With Secretary of Education.--The 
Commission shall consult and cooperate with the Secretary of Education 
in implementing and enforcing this Act, including in promulgating any 
regulations to carry out this Act, in matters involving educational 
agencies or institutions.
    (e) Relationship to State Law.--
            (1) In general.--This Act does not annul, alter, or affect, 
        or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this Act from 
        complying with, the laws of any State with respect to the 
        treatment of covered information by operators of school 
        services, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent 
        with any provision of this Act, and then only to the extent of 
        the inconsistency. For purposes of this paragraph, a law of a 
        State is not inconsistent with this Act if the protection such 
        law affords any user of a school service is greater than the 
        protection provided by this Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Any reference in this Act to 
        State law shall be considered also to refer to the law of a 
        political subdivision of a State.
