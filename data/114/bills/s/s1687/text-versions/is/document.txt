SEC. 2. RESTRICTION ON INSURANCE BUSINESS EXCEPTION TO PASSIVE FOREIGN 
              INVESTMENT COMPANY RULES.

    (a) In General.--Section 1297(b)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 is amended to read as follows:
                    ``(B) derived in the active conduct of an insurance 
                business by a qualifying insurance corporation (as 
                defined in subsection (f)),''.
    (b) Qualifying Insurance Corporation Defined.--Section 1297 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(f) Qualifying Insurance Corporation.--For purposes of subsection 
(b)(2)(B)--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `qualifying insurance 
        corporation' means, with respect to any taxable year, a foreign 
        corporation--
                    ``(A) which would be subject to tax under 
                subchapter L if such corporation were a domestic 
                corporation, and
                    ``(B) the applicable insurance liabilities of which 
                constitute more than 25 percent of its total assets, 
                determined on the basis of such liabilities and assets 
                as reported on the corporation's applicable financial 
                statement for the last year ending with or within the 
                taxable year.
            ``(2) Alternative facts and circumstances test for certain 
        corporations.--If a corporation fails to qualify as a qualified 
        insurance corporation under paragraph (1) solely because the 
        percentage determined under paragraph (1)(B) is 25 percent or 
        less, a United States person that owns stock in such 
        corporation may elect to treat such stock as stock of a 
        qualifying insurance corporation if--
                    ``(A) the percentage so determined for the 
                corporation is at least 10 percent, and
                    ``(B) under regulations provided by the Secretary, 
                based on the applicable facts and circumstances--
                            ``(i) the corporation is predominantly 
                        engaged in an insurance business, and
                            ``(ii) such failure is due solely to 
                        temporary circumstances involving such 
                        insurance business.
            ``(3) Applicable insurance liabilities.--For purposes of 
        this subsection--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `applicable insurance 
                liabilities' means, with respect to any life or 
                property and casualty insurance business--
                            ``(i) loss and loss adjustment expenses, 
                        and
                            ``(ii) reserves (other than deficiency, 
                        contingency, or unearned premium reserves) for 
                        life and health insurance risks and life and 
                        health insurance claims with respect to 
                        contracts providing coverage for mortality or 
                        morbidity risks.
                    ``(B) Limitations on amount of liabilities.--Any 
                amount determined under clause (i) or (ii) of 
                subparagraph (A) shall not exceed the lesser of such 
                amount--
                            ``(i) as reported to the applicable 
                        insurance regulatory body in the applicable 
                        financial statement described in paragraph 
                        (4)(A) (or, if less, the amount required by
