                    (D) Decision-making and dispute resolution 
                processes in partnering arrangements.

                partnership, including the security standards 
                established by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
            (3) Publication.--The Commissioner shall make publicly 
        available the criteria established under paragraph (2), and 
        shall notify the relevant committees of Congress not less than

        collection of fees.

            (8) Authority for numerical limitations.--
                    (A) Resource availability.--If the Commissioner 
                finds that resource or allocation constraints would 
                prevent U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 
                fulfilling, in whole or in part, requests for services 
                under the terms of existing or proposed fee agreements, 
                the Commissioner shall impose annual limits on the 
                number of new fee agreements.
                    (B) Annual review.--If the Commissioner limits the 
                number of new fee agreements under this paragraph, the 
                Commissioner shall annually evaluate and reassess such 
                limits and publish the results of such evaluation and 
                affirm any such limits that shall remain in effect in a 
                publicly available format.
            (9) Air ports of entry.--
                    (A) Certain costs.--A fee agreement for U.S. 
                Customs and Border Protection services at an air port 
                of entry may only provide for the reimbursement of--
                            (i) salaries and expenses of not more than 
                        5 full-time equivalent U.S. Customs and Border

                        (other than officers specified in clause (i)) 
                        to support U.S. customs and Border Protection 
                        officers in performing law enforcement

                        employees, including incentive pay for

                    (B) Preclearance.--The authority in the section may 
                not be used to enter into new preclearance agreements

                permanent relocation of an employee of the U.S. Customs

                        Protection;
                            (ii) would not unduly impact U.S. Customs

                        entry from which the relocation of the employee 
                        is proposed;
                            (iii) would be consistent with other 
                        applicable laws and regulations regarding the

                on the number of fee agreement proposals that the 
                Commissioner did not enter into due to numerical limits 
                on the number of fee agreements, if the Commissioner 
                adopts such limits.
            (11) Denied application.--If the Commissioner denies a

                responsibility of the U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection or any other agency of the Federal

                    (B) to unduly and permanently reduce the 
                responsibilities or duties of U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection to provide services at ports of entry that 
                have been authorized or mandated by law and are funded 
                in any appropriation Act or from any accounts in the 
                Treasury of the United States derived by the collection 
                of fees.

                        services.
            (5) Termination by the commissioner.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commissioner shall terminate 
                the services provided pursuant to a fee agreement with

                is due, fails to pay such fee in a timely manner.
                    (B) Effect of termination.--At the time services 
                are terminated pursuant to subparagraph (A), all costs

                have not been paid, will become immediately due and 
                payable.
                    (C) Interest.--Interest on unpaid fees will accrue 
                based on the quarterly rate(s) established under

                for a penalty or liquidated damage equal to 2 times the 
                amount of such fee.
                    (E) Amount collected.--Any amount collected 
                pursuant to a fee agreement shall be deposited into the 
                account specified under paragraph (4) and shall be 
                available as described therein.
                    (F) Return of unused funds.--The Commissioner shall

                to cause a reduction of U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protections services. No interest shall be owed upon
