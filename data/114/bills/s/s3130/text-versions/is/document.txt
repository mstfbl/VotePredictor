                        least 200 applicable beneficiaries during each 
                        year covered under the agreement unless the 
                        Secretary determines that a lower minimum 
                        number of applicable beneficiaries is necessary 
                        for the goals of the Program to be achieved.
                            ``(vi) The entity uses certified electronic 
                        health record technology and may use remote

                        criteria as the Secretary determines to be 
                        appropriate to participate in the Program.
                    ``(B) Physician.--The term `physician' means a 
                physician described in section 1861(r)(1) who has the 
                medical training or experience to fulfill the 
                physician's role described in subparagraph (A)(i).
            ``(2) Inclusion of affiliated providers and 
        practitioners.--Nothing in this subsection shall prevent an 
        independence at home medical practice from including providers 
        of services, practitioners described in section 1842(b)(18)(C), 
        or other practitioners, including pharmacists, in an 
        arrangement with the practice to share in any savings under the 
        Program.
    ``(c) Quality Measures and Performance Standards.--
            ``(1) Quality measures.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall determine 
                appropriate quality measures to assess the quality of 
                care furnished by independence at home medical 
                practices. To the extent possible, such measures shall 
                include outcome measures and experience of care 
                measures.
                    ``(B) Reporting requirements.--Under the Program, 
                an independence at home medical practice shall submit 
                data in a form and manner and at a frequency specified 
                by the Secretary.
            ``(2) Quality performance standards.--The Secretary shall 
        establish quality performance standards that independence at 
        home medical practices must meet in order to be eligible to 
        receive incentive payments under subsection (d)(2).
    ``(d) Incentive Payment Methodology.--
            ``(1) Establishment of target spending level.--The 
        Secretary shall establish an estimated annual spending target 
        based on the amount the Secretary estimates would have been 
        spent in the absence of the Program, for items and services 
        covered under parts A and B furnished to applicable 
        beneficiaries or comparable beneficiaries, as determined by the 
        Secretary, for each independence at home medical practice under 
        this section. Such spending targets shall be determined on a 
        per capita basis. Such spending targets shall include a risk 
        corridor that takes into account normal variation in 
        expenditures for items and services covered under parts A and B 
        furnished to such beneficiaries with the size of the corridor 
        being related to the number of applicable beneficiaries 
        furnished services by each independence at home medical 
        practice. The spending targets may also be adjusted for other 
        factors as the Secretary determines appropriate.
            ``(2) Incentive payments.--Subject to meeting the quality 
        performance standards under subsection (c)(2), an independence 
        at home medical practice is eligible to receive an incentive 
        payment under the Program if actual expenditures for a year for 
        the applicable beneficiaries who are attributed to the practice 
        are less than the estimated spending target established under 
        paragraph (1) for such year. An incentive payment for such year 
        shall be equal to a portion (as determined by the Secretary but 
        in no case greater than 80 percent) of the amount by which 
        actual expenditures (including incentive payments under this 
        paragraph) for applicable beneficiaries under parts A and B for 
        such year are estimated to be less than 5 percent less than the 
        estimated spending target for such year, as determined under 
        paragraph (1).
    ``(e) Applicable Beneficiary.--
            ``(1) In general.--In this section, the term `applicable 
        beneficiary' means an individual who the independence at home 
        medical practice to which the individual is attributed has 
        determined--

        shall conduct a study on the independence at home medical 
        practice program under section 1866F of the Social Security 
        Act, as added by subsection (a). Such study shall include an 
        analysis of--
                    (A) whether independence at home medical practices 
                are meeting the requirements under such program;
                    (B) whether such program is reducing expenditures 
                under this title;
                    (C) the care that beneficiaries are receiving under 
                such program; and
                    (D) other areas determined appropriate by the 
                Comptroller General.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of the 
        implementation of such independence at home medical practice 
        program, the Comptroller General of the United States shall 
        submit to Congress a report on the study conducted under 
        paragraph (1), together with such recommendations as the 
        Comptroller General determines to be appropriate.
    (c) Revisions to Existing Demonstration Program.--
            (1) Extension through the implementation of the new 
        program.--Section 1866E(e)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395cc-5(e)(1)) is amended by inserting ``plus the 
        period beginning at the end of such 5-year period and ending on 
        the date of the implementation of the program under section 
        1866F'' after ``5-year period''.
            (2) Permitting existing practices to see more 
        beneficiaries.--Section 1866E(e)(5) of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 1395cc-5(e)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following new sentence: ``Beginning on the date of the 
        enactment of this sentence, the limitation on the number of 
        beneficiaries that may participate in the demonstration program 
        pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not apply with respect 
        to independence at home medical practices participating in the 
        demonstration program as of such date of enactment.''.
