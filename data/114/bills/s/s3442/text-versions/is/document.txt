        to attach in aid of execution or execute against any such asset 
        that is involved in processing any transfer related to those 
        assets shall be discharged of any and all liability to any 
        party with respect to such funds transfer;
            ``(2) for purposes of determining the liability of the 
        originator of any mid-stream funds transfer to a terrorist 
        party, or to the agency or instrumentality of such a terrorist 
        party, the mid-stream funds transfer shall be treated as if it 
        were completed and payment were received by the intended 
        beneficiary; and

        assets of that terrorist party (including the blocked assets of 
        any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party) or has a 
        constitutionally protected interest in those blocked assets, 
        the court may make the blocked assets available for execution 
        or attachment in aid of execution under subsection (a) only to 
        the extent that--

                instrumentality of a terrorist party has an ownership 
                interest, as described in subsection (g)(3)(A), in the 
                blocked assets; and
                    ``(B) the execution or attachment does not infringe
