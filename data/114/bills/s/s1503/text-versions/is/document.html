_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for enhanced Federal efforts concerning the prevention, 
 education, treatment, and research activities related to Lyme disease 
 and other tick-borne diseases, including the establishment of a Tick-
                   Borne Diseases Advisory Committee.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease 
Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood 
        illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can 
        cause serious health problems.
            (2) Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia 
        burgdorferi, which belongs to the class of spirochaetes, and is 
        transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks. Early 
        signs of infection may include a rash and flu-like symptoms, 
        such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue.
            (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics 
        if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it 
        mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, Lyme 
        disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, and joint 
        problems because the bacteria can affect many different organs 
        and organ systems.
            (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive 
        treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, 
        neurological, and joint problems.
            (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all 
        vector-borne disease in the United States, the ticks that 
        spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as 
        anaplasmosis and babesiosis, and carry other strains of 
        Borrelia burgdorferi. Other tick species, such as the 
        aggressive lone star tick, spread ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain 
        spotted fever, and southern tick-associated rash illness 
        (STARI). Multiple diseases in 1 patient make diagnosis and 
        treatment more difficult.
            (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 
        over 36,000 confirmed or probable Lyme disease cases in 2013 
        and has estimated that the total number of people diagnosed 
        with Lyme disease annually is roughly 10 times higher than the 
        number of cases reported.
            (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, from 1992 to 2006, the incidence of Lyme disease 
        was highest among children 5 to 14 years of age.
            (8) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without 
        reliable testing makes diagnosis and treatment of patients more 
        difficult.
            (9) In the absence of a safe and effective human vaccine, 
        reducing exposure to ticks is the best defense against Lyme 
        disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and other tick-borne 
        diseases. Entomology-based approaches to prevent tick-borne 
        diseases include the use and development of insect repellent, 
        prompt tick removal, application of pesticides, and reduction 
        of tick habitat.

                    (A) the development of sensitive and more accurate 
                diagnostic tools and tests, including a direct 
                detection test for Lyme disease capable of 
                distinguishing active infection from past infection;
                    (B) improving the efficient utilization of 
                diagnostic tests that have been adequately validated 
                clinically available to account for the multiple 
                clinical manifestations of both acute and chronic Lyme 
                disease;
                    (C) providing for the timely evaluation of

                    (B) to evaluate the feasibility of developing a 
                reporting system for the collection of data on cases of 
                Lyme disease that do not meet the surveillance criteria 
                of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 
                order to more accurately gauge disease incidence;
                    (C) to evaluate the feasibility of creating a 
                national uniform reporting system including required 
                reporting by laboratories in each State; and
                    (D) to evaluate the feasibility of creating a 
                national monitoring system for tick populations.
            (3) Prevention activities, including--
                    (A) the provision and promotion of access to a 
                comprehensive, up-to-date clearinghouse of peer-
                reviewed information on Lyme disease and other tick-
                borne diseases;
                    (B) increased public education related to Lyme 
                disease and other tick-borne diseases through the 
                expansion of the Community Based Education Programs of 
                the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
                include expansion of information access points to the 
                public;
                    (C) the creation of a physician education program 
                that includes the full spectrum of scientific research 
                related to the identification of symptoms associated 
                with, and the diagnosis of, Lyme disease and other 
                tick-borne diseases, and, in coordination with the 
                Tick-Borne Diseases Advisory Committee established 
                under section 3, the publication of an annual report 
                that evaluates published guidelines and current 
                research available on Lyme disease, in order to best 
                educate health professionals on the latest research and 
                diversity of treatment options for Lyme disease;
                    (D) research to understand mechanisms of tick 
                repellents and to develop new chemical and non-chemical 
                strategies for the control of ticks; and
                    (E) exploring the utility and potential for the 
                development of a safe and effective vaccine against 
                Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases.
            (4) Sponsoring scientific conferences on Lyme disease and 
        other tick-borne diseases, including reporting in accordance 
        with subsection (c) and consideration of the full spectrum of 
        clinically based knowledge, with the first of such conferences 
        to be held not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
        of this Act.
            (5) Clinical outcomes research, including--
                    (A) the establishment of epidemiological research 
                objectives to determine the long-term course of illness 
                for Lyme disease; and

            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        participation in or sponsorship of scientific conferences and 
        meetings is essential to the mission of the Department of
