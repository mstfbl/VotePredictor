                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Public Health Service Act, in relation to requiring 
              adrenoleukodystrophy screening of newborns.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Aidan's Law''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Adrenoleukodystrophy is a deadly genetic disease that 
        destroys myelin, the protective sheath that surrounds the 
        brain's neurons, which are the nerve cells that allow us to 
        think and to control our muscles.
            (2) Adrenoleukodystrophy affects 1 in 17,000 people and 
        most severely affects boys and men.
            (3) Adrenoleukodystrophy newborn screening tests have been 
        validated with false positive of less than 0.1 percent.
            (4) Early identification of adrenoleukodystrophy allows 
        those who are affected to be treated and have the best chance 
        at a healthy life.

SEC. 3. REQUIRING THE SCREENING OF ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY.

    (a) In General.--Part A of title XI of the Public Health Services 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300b-1 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``SEC. 1118. ADRENOLEUKODYSTROPHY.

    ``(a) In General.--Each hospital, child care center, clinic, or 
other similar institution caring for infants who are 28 days or less of 
age (as designated by the Secretary) shall administer, or cause to have 
administered, to every such infant in its care a test for 
adrenoleukodystrophy in accordance with this section.
    ``(b) Process.--
            ``(1) In general.--In carrying out this section, the chief 
        executive officer for health in each State shall prescribe 
        standards and procedures for the administration of testing 
        under subsection (a), including recording the results of such 
        tests, tracking activities, conducting follow-up reviews, and 
        carrying out educational activities.
            ``(2) Dissemination of information.--In carrying out this 
        section, the chief executive officer for health in each State 
        shall prescribe standards and procedures setting forth the 
        manner in which testing information is disseminated to a parent 
        or guardian of the infant to be tested.
            ``(3) Failure to prescribe.--If a State has not prescribed 
        standards and procedures that are approved as provided for in 
        paragraph (4) by the date that is 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this section, the Discretionary Advisory Committee 
        on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children established 
        under section 1111 (referred to in this section as the 
        `Advisory Committee') shall prescribe appropriate standards and 
        procedures for such State.
            ``(4) Review and approval.--The standards and procedures 
        prescribed under this subsection shall be subject to review and 
        approval by the Advisory Committee. In reviewing or prescribing 
        standards and procedures as required under this subsection, the 
        Advisory Committee shall consider standards and procedures 
        adopted in other States with respect to the screening of 
        adrenoleukodystrophy, the standards and procedures adopted in 
        such State with respect to the screening of infants for other 
        heritable diseases, and any scientific evidence the Advisory 
        Committee considers relevant to provide for the screening of 
        infants for adrenoleukodystrophy.''.
    (b) Penalty.--A State that fails to prescribe standards and 
procedures as required under section 1118 of the Public Health Service 
Act shall not be eligible for funds under the Heritable Disorders 
Program established under title XI of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 300b-1 et seq.).
    (c) Reauthorization of Heritable Disorders Program.--Section 1117 
of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300b-16) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;

        2019; and''.
