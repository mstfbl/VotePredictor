                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to carry out programs and 
    activities that connect people in the United States, especially 
           children, youth, and families, with the outdoors.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) children today are spending less time outdoors than any 
        generation in human history, as evidenced by studies that show 
        children enjoy half as much time outdoors today as children did 
        just 20 years ago, while children spend more than 7\1/2\ hours 
        every day in front of electronic media;
            (2) the health of children in the United States is at risk 
        as evidenced by the growing obesity crisis in which, during the 
        past 30 years, the childhood obesity rate has more than doubled 
        and the adolescent obesity rate has quadrupled, costing the 
        economy of the United States billions of dollars each year;
            (3) the rise in childhood obesity has had a negative 
        economic impact;
            (4) the readiness of the military is declining as nearly 1 
        in 4 applicants to the military is rejected for being 
        overweight or obese, which is the most common reason for 
        medical disqualification;
            (5) research has shown that military children and families 
        are facing increased stress and mental strain and challenges 
        due to multiple, extended deployments;
            (6) military family service organizations have developed 
        programs that connect military children and families with 
        positive, meaningful outdoor experiences that benefit mental 
        and physical health, but the programs lack sufficient resources 
        to meet increasing demand;
            (7) the outdoor retail industry, many local tourist 
        destinations or ``gateway communities'', and State fish and 
        wildlife agencies rely on revenue generated from individuals 
        spending time outdoors to create jobs in local communities;
            (8) over the past several years, urbanization, changing 
        land use patterns, increasing road traffic, and inadequate 
        solutions to addressing those challenges in the built 
        environment have combined to make it more difficult for many 
        people in the United States to walk or bike to schools, parks, 
        and play areas or experience the natural environment;
            (9) spending time in green spaces outside the home, 
        including public land, parks, play areas, and gardens--
                    (A) increases concentration, inhibition of initial 
                impulses, and self-discipline in children; and
                    (B) has been shown to reduce stress and mental 
                fatigue in children;
            (10) in one study, children who were exposed to greener 
        environments in a public housing area demonstrated less 
        aggression, violence, and stress;
            (11) visitation to public land in the United States has 
        declined or remained flat in recent years, and yet, connecting 
        with nature and the great outdoors in communities is critical 
        to fostering the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts who 
        will visit, appreciate, and become stewards of the public land 
        in the United States;
            (12) spending time outdoors in nature--
                    (A) is beneficial to the physical, mental, and 
                emotional health of children; and
                    (B) has been proven--
                            (i) to decrease symptoms of attention 
                        deficit and hyperactivity disorder in children;
                            (ii) to stimulate brain development, 
                        improve motor skills, result in better sleep, 
                        reduce stress, increase creativity, and improve 
                        moods in children; and
                            (iii) to reduce the risk of developing 
                        myopia in children;
            (13) children who spend time playing outside are more 
        likely to take risks, seek out adventure, develop self-
        confidence, and respect the value of nature;
            (14) a direct childhood experience with nature before the 
        age of 11 promotes a long-term connection to nature;
            (15) conservation education and outdoor recreation 
        experiences such as camping, hiking, boating, hunting, fishing, 
        archery, recreational shooting, wildlife watching, and other 
        experiences are critical to engaging young people in the 
        outdoors;
            (16) as children become more disconnected from the natural 
        world, the hunting and angling conservation legacy of the 
        United States is at risk;
            (17) hunters and anglers play a critical role in 
        reconnecting young people with nature, protecting the natural 
        resources of the United States, and fostering a lifelong 
        understanding of the value of conserving the natural world;
            (18) research demonstrates that hunters that become engaged 
        in hunting as children are among the most active and interested 
        hunters as adults;
            (19) the vast majority of hunters report that the hunters 
        were introduced to hunting between the ages of 10 and 12, with 
        the overwhelming majority of children being introduced to 
        hunting by an adult;
            (20) parks and recreation, youth-serving, service-learning, 
        conservation, health, education, and built-environment 
        organizations, facilities, and personnel provide critical 
        resources and infrastructure for connecting children and 
        families with nature;
            (21) it takes many dedicated people to work to preserve, 
        protect, enhance, and restore natural resources in the United 
        States;
            (22) with an aging workforce in the natural resource 
        professions, it is critical for the next generation to have an 
        appreciation for nature and be ready to take over the 
        responsibilities relating to the natural resources of the 
        United States;
            (23) place-based service-learning opportunities use land 
        and water as the context for learning by engaging students in 
        the process of exploration, action, and reflection;
            (24) physical activity outdoors connected with meaningful 
        community service to solve real-world problems, such as 
        removing invasive plants or removing trash from a streambed, 
        strengthens communities by engaging youth as citizen stewards;
            (25) States and community-based partners have some notable 
        programs that connect children and families with nature, yet 
        most States lack sufficient resources and a comprehensive 
        strategy to effectively engage State agencies across multiple 
        fields; and
            (26) States need to engage in cross-sector agency and 
        nonprofit collaboration that involves public health and 
        wellness, parks and recreation, transportation and city 
        planning, and other sectors focused on connecting children and 
        families with the outdoors to increase coordination and 
        effective implementation of the policy tools and programs that 
        a State can bring to bear to provide outdoor opportunities for 
        children and families.

SEC. 5. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR ENCOURAGING PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES 
              TO BE ACTIVE OUTDOORS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than September 30, 2016, the President, 
in cooperation with the heads of appropriate Federal departments and 
agencies, shall develop and issue a national strategy for encouraging 
people in the United States (especially children, youth, and families) 
to be physically active outdoors.
    (b) Requirements.--The strategy developed under subsection (a) 
shall include--
            (1) the identification of--
                    (A) barriers to people in the United States 
                (especially children, youth, and families) spending 
                time outdoors; and
                    (B) specific policy solutions to address the 
                barriers identified under subparagraph (A);
            (2) the identification of opportunities for partnerships 
        with Federal, State, tribal, and local partners;
            (3) the coordination of efforts among the heads of 
        appropriate Federal departments and agencies to address the 
        impacts of people in the United States (especially children, 
        youth, and families) spending less active time outdoors on--
                    (A) public health, including childhood obesity, 
                attention deficit disorders and stress;
                    (B) the future of conservation in the United 
                States; and
                    (C) the economy of the United States;

                    (A) may use, incorporate, or otherwise consider 
                existing Federal plans and strategies that, in whole or 
                in part, contribute to connecting people in the United 
                States, especially children, youth, and families, with 
                the outdoors; and
                    (B) shall provide for public participation, 
                including a national summit of participants with 
                demonstrated expertise in encouraging individuals to be 
                physically active outdoors in nature.
