                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the 
 Environmental Protection Agency to propose a regulation revising the 
 definition of the term ``waters of the United States'', and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Water Quality 
Protection Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) in section 101(b) of the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(b)), Congress adopted the 
        principle of cooperative federalism, recognizing that ``[i]t is 
        the policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect 
        the primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, 
        reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and 
        use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of 
        land and water resources, and to consult with the Administrator 
        in the exercise of his authority under this Act'';</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) adequate consultation with States and local 
        governments and affected entities is necessary--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) to ensure that Federal departments and 
                agencies understand the scope and impacts of regulatory 
                proposals;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) to maintain the cooperative federalism 
                foundation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
                (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) to respect the limits on Federal 
                authority;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3)(A) States have robust water quality protection 
        programs capable of greater regulatory controls on waters not 
        covered by Federal jurisdiction; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (B) an exclusion of waters from Federal 
        jurisdiction does not mean that excluded waters will be exempt 
        from regulation and protection, but rather, it recognizes the 
        limits of Federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the primary 
        role of States in protecting State waters; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of 
        title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the 
        ``Administrative Procedure Act''), requires each agency to 
        provide notice and an opportunity to comment regarding--
        </DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) information, including scientific and 
                technical findings, on which the agency relies in 
                taking a regulatory action; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) definitions, exclusions, and standards 
                that determine the limits of Federal 
                regulation.</DELETED>

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Water Quality Protection 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in section 101(b) of the Federal Water Pollution 
        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(b)), Congress adopted the principle 
        of cooperative federalism, recognizing that ``[i]t is the 
        policy of the Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the 
        primary responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, 
        reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the development and 
        use (including restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of 
        land and water resources, and to consult with the Administrator 
        in the exercise of his authority under this Act'';
            (2) adequate consultation with States and local governments 
        and affected entities is necessary--
                    (A) to ensure that Federal departments and agencies 
                understand the scope and impacts of regulatory 
                proposals;
                    (B) to maintain the cooperative federalism 
                foundation of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
                (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and
                    (C) to respect the limits on Federal authority;
            (3)(A) States have robust water quality protection programs 
        capable of greater regulatory controls on waters not covered by 
        Federal jurisdiction; and
            (B) an exclusion of waters from Federal jurisdiction does 
        not mean that excluded waters will be exempt from regulation 
        and protection, but rather, it recognizes the limits of Federal 
        jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
        U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and the primary role of States in 
        protecting State waters; and
            (4) subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, 
        United States Code (commonly known as the ``Administrative 
        Procedure Act''), requires each agency to provide notice and an 
        opportunity to comment regarding--
                    (A) information, including scientific and technical 
                findings, on which the agency relies in taking a 
                regulatory action; and
                    (B) definitions, exclusions, and standards that 
                determine the limits of Federal regulation.

SEC. 4. REVISED DEFINITION; PRINCIPLES AND PROCESS.

    (a) Revised Definition.--A revision to or guidance on a regulatory 
definition of the term ``navigable waters'' or ``waters of the United 
States'' promulgated or issued pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution 
Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) after February 4, 2015, shall have 
no force or effect--
            (1) unless the revision adheres to the principles under 
        subsection (b); and
            (2) until after the Secretary and the Administrator carry 
        out each action described in subsection (c).
    (b) Principles.--In promulgating a revised regulatory definition 
pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary and the Administrator shall 
adhere to the following principles:
            (1) The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
        et seq.) is an Act to protect traditional navigable waters from 
        water pollution.
            (2) The term ``waters of the United States'' under the 
        Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) 
        should identify bodies of water subject to Federal 
        jurisdiction, and, except as provided in paragraph (3), should 
        include--
                    (A) traditional navigable waters and interstate 
                waters;
                    (B) the reach of a stream that is--
                            (i) identified on 1 or more maps created 
                        using the United States Geological Survey 
                        National Hydrology Dataset Plus at the 
                        1:100,000 scale from Reach Address Database 
                        Version 3.1, consistent with the scale and 
                        reach address database used by the 
                        Administrator during July 2009, in conjunction 
                        with information on drinking water source 
                        protection areas, to identify potential sources 
                        of water for public drinking water systems; or
                            (ii) for any State for which a map at the 
                        scale described in clause (i) is not available, 
                        identified on a map using the United States 
                        Geological Survey National Hydrology Dataset 
                        Plus at the available scale that is closest to 
                        the scale described in clause (i);
                    (C) the reach of a stream that, through a surface 
                hydrologic connection, contributes flow in a normal 
                year to a traditional navigable water of sufficient 
                volume, duration, and frequency that pollutants in that 
                reach would degrade the water quality of the 
                traditional navigable water, based on a quantifiable 
                and statistically valid measure of flow for that 
                geographic area; and
                    (D) wetlands situated next to a water of the United 
                States that, in a normal year, protect the water 
                quality of a navigable water by preventing the movement 
                of pollutants to a navigable water.
            (3) The term ``waters of the United States'' under the 
        Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) 
        should not include--
                    (A) water that is located below the surface of the 
                land, including soil water and groundwater;
                    (B) water that is not located within a body of 
                water;
                    (C) an isolated pond, whether natural or manmade, 
                including a farm pond, fish pond, quarry, mine pit, 
                ornamental pond, swimming pool, construction pit, fire 
                control pond, sediment pond, and any other isolated 
                facility or system that holds water;
                    (D) a system constructed or used for the purpose of 
                collecting, conveying, holding, or treating--
                            (i) stormwater or floodwater within the 
                        boundaries of a State, tribal, municipal, 
                        industrial, agricultural, silvicultural, 
                        residential, or Federal facility or operation, 
                        including ditches along agricultural fields,

                                    (II) not including instream 
                                reservoirs or other instream 
                                facilities; or
                            (iv) water for agricultural or 
                        silvicultural purposes by a municipality or at 
                        an agricultural or silvicultural facility or 
                        operation, including irrigation water, a fish

                    (E) the reach of a stream that, through a surface 
                hydrologic connection, does not contribute flow in a 
                normal year to a traditional navigable water of 
                sufficient volume, duration, and frequency that 
                pollutants in that reach would degrade the water 
                quality of the traditional navigable water, based on a 
                quantifiable and statistically valid measure of flow 
                for that geographic area;
                    (F) prior-converted cropland (as defined in section 
                12.2(a) of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (as in 
                effect on the date of enactment of this Act)); and
                    (G) any water that is no longer a water of the 
                United States pursuant to a permit issued under--
                            (i) section 10 of the Act of March 3, 1899 
                        (commonly known as the ``Rivers and Harbors 
                        Appropriation Act of 1899'') (33 U.S.C. 403);

                        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344).
            (4) Unless a subparagraph of paragraph (3) other than 
        subparagraph (D) applies, for purposes of the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), the term 
        ``waters of the United States'' should include a system 
        described in paragraph (3)(D), or a component of such a system, 
        if the Secretary or the Administrator demonstrates that--
                    (A) the system or component was a water of the 
                United States that was converted for use for the 
                purpose described in paragraph (3)(D) after the 
                effective date of initial regulations implementing 
                section 404 of that Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), without a 
                permit under that section unless the construction or 
                use of the system or component--
                            (i) is described in subparagraph (A) or (C) 
                        of section 404(f)(1) of that Act (33 U.S.C.

                            (ii) was otherwise exempt from permitting 
                        under that Act; or
                    (B) the system or component was a traditional 
                navigable water that was converted for use for the 
                purpose described in paragraph (3)(D), at any time 
                unless--
                            (i) the system or component is identified 
                        as a point source in a permit issued under 
                        section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution 
                        Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342);
                            (ii) the water managed in the system or 
                        component is--
                                    (I) irrigation return flow exempt 
                                from permitting under section 402(l)(1) 
                                of that Act (33 U.S.C. 1342(l)(1)); or
                                    (II) agricultural stormwater or 
                                return flows from irrigated agriculture 
                                exempt from permitting under section 
                                502(14) of that Act (33 U.S.C. 
                                1362(14));
                            (iii) the construction or use of the system 
                        or component is described in subparagraph (A) 
                        or (C) of section 404(f)(1) of that Act (33 
                        U.S.C. 1344(f)(1)); or
                            (iv) the system or component is a waste 
                        treatment system.
            (5) In promulgating a revised definition of waters of the 
        United States, the Secretary and the Administrator shall take 
        into consideration that--
                    (A) the use of a body of water by an organism, 
                including a migratory bird, does not provide a basis 
                for establishing Federal jurisdiction under the Federal 
                Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.);
                    (B) the supply of water to a groundwater aquifer 
                and the storage of water in an isolated body of water 
                are issues that--
                            (i) pertain to the use of water resources 
                        that shall not be superseded, abrogated, or 
                        otherwise impaired by the Federal Water 
                        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) 
                        pursuant to sections 101(g) and 510(2) of that 
                        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(g), 1370(2)); and
                            (ii) do not provide a basis for 
                        establishing Federal jurisdiction under that 
                        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and
                    (C) evaporation, transpiration, condensation, 
                precipitation, the overland flow of water, and the 
                movement of water in an aquifer are all part of the 
                water cycle and may connect all water over sufficiently 
                long periods of time and distances, but do not provide 
                a basis for establishing Federal jurisdiction under the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et 
                seq.).
            (6) Waters that are waters of the United States should be 
        identified on maps provided by the Secretary and the 
        Administrator to promote certainty and transparency in 
        jurisdictional determinations.
    (c) Consideration, Consultation, and Report.--
            (1) Federalism.--
                    (A) In general.--In proposing and promulgating a 
                regulation pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary 
                and the Administrator shall ensure compliance with the 
                federalism policymaking criteria and consultation in 
                accordance with Executive Order 13132 (64 Fed. Reg. 
                43255 (August 4, 1999)), regardless of whether the 
                Secretary and the Administrator determine that the 
                regulation would have any substantial and direct effect 
                on--
                            (i) States;
                            (ii) the relationship between the Federal 
                        Government and the States; or
                            (iii) the distribution of power and 
                        responsibilities among the various levels of 
                        government.
                    (B) Consultation.--
                            (i) In general.--To be considered 
                        meaningful consultation described in section 
                        101(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control 
                        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(b)), before publication of 
                        a proposed rule under this section, 
                        consultation shall include a discussion of 
                        alternative approaches with and a request for 
                        input and advice on the approaches from States 
                        and political subdivisions of States, 
                        including--
                                    (I) Governors;
                                    (II) State departments with 
                                authority over water supply and water 
                                quality;
                                    (III) State departments of 
                                agriculture; and
                                    (IV) local governments, including 
                                elected officials, local governmental 
                                entities with authority over water 
                                supply, stormwater, waste water, 
                                floodplain management, and flood 
                                control, irrigation districts, and 
                                conservation districts.
                            (ii) Topics.--The topics to be addressed in 
                        the consultation under this paragraph should 
                        include--
                                    (I) categories of waters, in 
                                addition to those discussed in 
                                paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection 
                                (b), that should be subject to Federal 
                                jurisdiction or should be subject 
                                solely to State or local regulation;
                                    (II) what is the role of States in 
                                the identification of waters subject to 
                                Federal jurisdiction; and
                                    (III) whether channels in which 
                                water is present only during or for a 
                                short time after a precipitation event 
                                are correctly categorized as 
                                geomorphological features rather than 
                                hydrologic features.
            (2) Regulatory flexibility.--In proposing and promulgating 
        a regulation pursuant to subsection (a), and regardless of 
        whether the Secretary and the Administrator determine that the 
        regulation would have a significant impact on a substantial 
        number of small entities, the Secretary and the Administrator 
        shall--
                    (A) carry out the actions described in sections 
                603, 604, and 609 of title 5, United States Code; and
                    (B) in carrying out those actions, take into 
                consideration the costs of all programs under the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et 
                seq.), regardless of whether the Secretary and the 
                Administrator consider the costs of the proposed 
                regulation to be direct or indirect.
            (3) Unfunded mandates.--In proposing and promulgating a 
        regulation pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary and the 
        Administrator shall evaluate the intergovernmental and private 
        sector impacts of the regulation, in accordance with title II 
        of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531 et 
        seq.), regardless of whether the Secretary and the 
        Administrator--
                    (A) consider the impacts of the proposed regulation 
                to be direct or indirect; or
                    (B) determine that expenditures resulting from the 
                proposed regulation would meet the monetary thresholds 
                established in that Act (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.).
            (4) Improving regulation and regulatory review.--In 
        proposing and promulgating a regulation pursuant to subsection 
        (a), regardless of whether the Secretary and the Administrator 
        consider the regulation to be a significant regulatory action 
        or significantly affect State, local, and tribal governments, 
        the Secretary and the Administrator shall ensure that the 
        regulation meets the requirements of--
                    (A) Executive Order 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; 
                relating to regulatory planning and review); and
                    (B) Executive Order 13563 (76 Fed. Reg. 3821 
                (January 18, 2011)).
            (5) Improving performance of federal permitting and review 
        of infrastructure projects.--In proposing and promulgating a 
        regulation pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary and the 
        Administrator shall consider--
                    (A) Executive Order 13604 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; 
                relating to improving performance of Federal permitting 
                and review of infrastructure projects); and
                    (B) the goal of reducing the time to make decisions 
                in the permitting and review of infrastructure projects 
                by the Federal Government.
            (6) Report.--Not later than the date that is 30 days before 
        the date of issuance of a proposed regulation pursuant to 
        subsection (a), the Secretary and the Administrator shall 
        submit to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
        of the House of Representatives a report that--
                    (A) describes the means by which the proposed 
                regulation, if finalized, would achieve compliance 
                with--
                            (i) Executive Order 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 
                        note; relating to regulatory planning and 
                        review), including the means by which--
                                    (I) the regulation would impose the 
                                least burden on society, consistent 
                                with obtaining regulatory objectives, 
                                taking into account, among other 
                                things, and to the maximum extent 
                                practicable, the costs of cumulative 
                                regulations; and
                                    (II) the Secretary and the 
                                Administrator identified and assessed 
                                available alternatives to direct 
                                regulation;
                            (ii) section 2(i) of Executive Order 13132 
                        (64 Fed. Reg. 43256 (August 4, 1999)), which 
                        requires agencies to ``act only with the

    After providing public notice and an opportunity for comment, the

SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

    Not later than the date that is 3 years after the date of

governments and other affected entities, shall--
            (1) review the jurisdictional determinations made during

                reduce the inconsistency or an explanation of the 
                geographic differences that make the inconsistency 
                appropriate; and
                    (D) the impacts of those interpretations on Federal 
                permitting and review of infrastructure projects, and

        a navigable water under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
        (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); or
            (2) to take any enforcement action with respect to an 
        unpermitted discharge under that Act.
    (b) Water Transfers.--Nothing in this Act affects a determination 
regarding whether the transfer of water from 1 body of water to another 
requires a permit under section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution

    (c) Retention of State Authority.--Nothing in this Act places any 
limitation on the scope of water subject to State jurisdiction under
