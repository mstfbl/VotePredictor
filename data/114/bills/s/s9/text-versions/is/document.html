                assurances of the safety and efficacy of over-the-
                counter hearing aids, such as appropriate consumer 
                labeling; and
                    (B) describe the requirements under which the sale 
                of over-the-counter hearing aids is permitted, without 
                the supervision, prescription, or other order, 
                involvement, or intervention of a licensed person, to

        counter hearing aids (as defined in section 520(o) of the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(o)), as 
        amended by subsection (a)) require a report under section

        otherwise not identical to, the regulations promulgated under 
        this subsection.
    (c) Guidance.--
            (1) Withdrawal of guidance.--
                    (A) Withdrawal.--Effective as of the date of 
                enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall not use the

                Services entitled, ``Regulatory Requirements for 
                Hearing Aid Devices and Personal Sound Amplification 
                Products'', issued on November 7, 2013, as the basis 
                for any premarket review under the Federal Food, Drug, 
                and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or for any 
                related compliance or enforcement decisions or actions.
                    (B) Interim guidance.--Until such time as new final 
                guidance is issued under paragraph (2) to replace the 
                guidance described in subparagraph (A), the draft 
                guidance entitled ``Guidance for Industry and FDA 
                Staff: Regulatory Requirements for Hearing Aid Devices 
                and Personal Sound Amplification Products,'' issued on 
                February 25, 2009, shall be in effect.
            (2) New guidance issued.--Not later than the date on which

        paragraph (1)(A). Such updated guidance shall clarify which 
        products, on the basis of claims or other marketing, 
        advertising, or labeling material, meet the definition of a 
        device, as defined in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
        and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) and which products meet the
