             Subtitle E--Delaware River Basin Conservation

SEC. 3501. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds that--
        (1) the Delaware River Basin is a national treasure of great 
    cultural, environmental, ecological, and economic importance;
        (2) the Basin contains over 12,500 square miles of land in the 
    States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, 
    including nearly 800 square miles of bay and more than 2,000 
    tributary rivers and streams;
        (3) the Basin is home to more than 8,000,000 people who depend 
    on the Delaware River and the Delaware Bay as an economic engine, a 
    place of recreation, and a vital habitat for fish and wildlife;
        (4) the Basin provides clean drinking water to more than 
    15,000,000 people, including New York City, which relies on the 
    Basin for approximately half of the drinking water supply of the 
    city, and Philadelphia, whose most significant threat to the 
    drinking water supply of the city is loss of forests and other 
    natural cover in the Upper Basin, according to a study conducted by 
    the Philadelphia Water Department;
        (5) the Basin contributes $25,000,000,000 annually in economic 
    activity, provides $21,000,000,000 in ecosystem goods and services 
    per year, and is directly or indirectly responsible for 600,000 
    jobs with $10,000,000,000 in annual wages;
        (6) almost 180 species of fish and wildlife are considered 
    special status species in the Basin due to habitat loss and 
    degradation, particularly sturgeon, eastern oyster, horseshoe 
    crabs, and red knots, which have been identified as unique species 
    in need of habitat improvement;
        (7) the Basin provides habitat for over 200 resident and 
    migrant fish species, includes significant recreational fisheries, 
    and is an important source of eastern oyster, blue crab, and the 
    largest population of the American horseshoe crab;
        (8) the annual dockside value of commercial eastern oyster 
    fishery landings for the Delaware Estuary is nearly $4,000,000, 
    making it the fourth most lucrative fishery in the Delaware River 
    Basin watershed, and proven management strategies are available to 
    increase oyster habitat, abundance, and harvest;
        (9) the Delaware Bay has the second largest concentration of 
    shorebirds in North America and is designated as one of the 4 most 
    important shorebird migration sites in the world;
        (10) the Basin, 50 percent of which is forested, also has over 
    700,000 acres of wetland, more than 126,000 acres of which are 
    recognized as internationally important, resulting in a landscape 
    that provides essential ecosystem services, including recreation, 
    commercial, and water quality benefits;
        (11) much of the remaining exemplary natural landscape in the 
    Basin is vulnerable to further degradation, as the Basin gains 
    approximately 10 square miles of developed land annually, and with 
    new development, urban watersheds are increasingly covered by 
    impervious surfaces, amplifying the quantity of polluted runoff 
    into rivers and streams;
        (12) the Delaware River is the longest undammed river east of 
    the Mississippi; a critical component of the National Wild and 
    Scenic Rivers System in the Northeast, with more than 400 miles 
    designated; home to one of the most heavily visited National Park 
    units in the United States, the Delaware Water Gap National 
    Recreation Area; and the location of 6 National Wildlife Refuges;
        (13) the Delaware River supports an internationally renowned 
    cold water fishery in more than 80 miles of its northern headwaters 
    that attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year and generates 
    over $21,000,000 in annual revenue through tourism and recreational 
    activities;
        (14) management of water volume in the Basin is critical to 
    flood mitigation and habitat for fish and wildlife, and following 3 
    major floods along the Delaware River since 2004, the Governors of 
    the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania have 
    called for natural flood damage reduction measures to combat the 
    problem, including restoring the function of riparian corridors;
        (15) the Delaware River Port Complex (including docking 
    facilities in the States of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) 
    is one of the largest freshwater ports in the world, the Port of 
    Philadelphia handles the largest volume of international tonnage 
    and 70 percent of the oil shipped to the East Coast, and the Port 
    of Wilmington, a full-service deepwater port and marine terminal 
    supporting more than 12,000 jobs, is the busiest terminal on the 
    Delaware River, handling more than 400 vessels per year with an 
    annual import/export cargo tonnage of more than 4,000,000 tons;
        (16) the Delaware Estuary, where freshwater from the Delaware 
    River mixes with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean, is one of the 
    largest and most complex of the 28 estuaries in the National 
    Estuary Program, and the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary works 
    to improve the environmental health of the Delaware Estuary;
        (17) the Delaware River Basin Commission is a Federal-
    interstate compact government agency charged with overseeing a 
    unified approach to managing the river system and implementing 
    important water resources management projects and activities 
    throughout the Basin that are in the national interest;
        (18) restoration activities in the Basin are supported through 
    several Federal and State agency programs, and funding for those 
    important programs should continue and complement the establishment 
    of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, which is intended 
    to build on and help coordinate restoration and protection funding 
    mechanisms at the Federal, State, regional, and local levels; and
        (19) the existing and ongoing voluntary conservation efforts in 
    the Delaware River Basin necessitate improved efficiency and cost 
    effectiveness, as well as increased private-sector investments and 
    coordination of Federal and non-Federal resources.

    implement a pilot project to test and evaluate the ability to 
    operate the Delta cross-channel gates daily or as otherwise may be 
    appropriate to keep them open to the greatest extent practicable to 
    protect out-migrating salmonids, manage salinities in the interior 
    Delta and any other water quality issues, and maximize Central 
    Valley Project and State Water Project pumping, subject to the 
    condition that the pilot project shall be designed and implemented 
    consistent with operational criteria and monitoring criteria 
    required by the California State Water Resources Control Board; and
        (B) design, implement, and evaluate such real-time monitoring 
    capabilities to enable effective real-time operations of the cross

    California and elsewhere;
        (12) pursuant to the research and adaptive management 
    procedures of the smelt biological opinion and the salmonid 
    biological opinion use all available scientific tools to identify 
    any changes to the real-time operations of Bureau of Reclamation, 
    State, and local water projects that could result in the 
    availability of additional water supplies; and
        (13) determine whether alternative operational or other 
    management measures would meet applicable regulatory requirements 
    for listed species while maximizing water supplies and water supply 
    reliability; and
        (14) continue to vary the averaging period of the Delta Export/
    Inflow ratio, to the extent consistent with any applicable State 
    Water Resources Control Board orders under decision D-1641, to 
    operate to a
            (A) ratio using a 3-day averaging period on the rising limb 
        of a Delta inflow hydrograph; and
            (B) 14-day averaging period on the falling limb of the 
        Delta inflow hydrograph.
    (c) Other Agencies.--To the extent that a Federal agency other than 
the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce has a 
role in approving projects described in subsections (a) and (b), this 
section shall apply to the Federal agency.

        (including regulations).
    (e) Operations Plan.--The Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior, 
in consultation with appropriate State officials, shall develop an 
operations plan that is consistent with the provisions of this subtitle 
and other applicable Federal and State laws, including provisions that 
are intended to provide additional water supplies that could be of 
assistance during the current drought.
SEC. 4002. SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED IMPLEMENTATION OF OMR FLOW 
REQUIREMENTS.
    (a) In General.--In implementing the provisions of the smelt 
biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, the Secretary 
of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall manage reverse flow 
in Old and Middle Rivers at the most negative reverse flow rate allowed 
under the applicable biological opinion to maximize water supplies for 
the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, unless that 
management of reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers to maximize water 
supplies would cause additional adverse effects on the listed fish 
species beyond the range of effects anticipated to occur to the listed 
fish species for the duration of the applicable biological opinion, or 
would be inconsistent with applicable State law requirements, including 
water quality, salinity control, and compliance with State Water 
Resources Control Board Order D-1641 or a successor order.
    (b) Requirements.--If the Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of 
Commerce determines to manage rates of pumping at the C.W. ``Bill'' 
Jones and the Harvey O. Banks pumping plants in the southern Delta to 
achieve a reverse OMR flow rate less negative than the most negative 
reverse flow rate prescribed by the applicable biological opinion, the 
Secretary shall--
        (1) document in writing any significant facts regarding real-
    time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse flow 
    rates, including--
            (A) targeted real-time fish monitoring in the Old River 
        pursuant to this section, including as it pertains to the smelt 
        biological opinion monitoring of Delta smelt in the vicinity of 
        Station 902;
            (B) near-term forecasts with available salvage models under 
        prevailing conditions of the effects on the listed species of 
        OMR flow at the most negative reverse flow rate prescribed by 
        the biological opinion; and
            (C) any requirements under applicable State law; and
        (2) explain in writing why any decision to manage OMR reverse 
    flow at rates less negative than the most negative reverse flow 
    rate prescribed by the biological opinion is necessary to avoid 
    additional adverse effects on the listed fish species beyond the 
    range of effects anticipated to occur to the listed fish species 
    for the duration of the applicable biological opinion, after 
    considering relevant factors such as--
            (A) the distribution of the listed species throughout the 
        Delta;
            (B) the potential effects of high entrainment risk on 
        subsequent species abundance;
            (C) the water temperature;
            (D) other significant factors relevant to the 
        determination, as required by applicable Federal or State laws;
            (E) turbidity; and
            (F) whether any alternative measures could have a 
        substantially lesser water supply impact.
    (c) Level of Detail Required.--The analyses and documentation 
required by this section shall be comparable to the depth and 
complexity as is appropriate for real time decision-making. This 
section shall not be interpreted to require a level of administrative 
findings and documentation that could impede the execution of effective 
real time adaptive management.
    (d) First Sediment Flush.--During the first flush of sediment out 
of the Delta in each water year, and provided that such determination 
is based upon objective evidence, notwithstanding subsection (a), the 
Secretary of the Interior shall manage OMR flow pursuant to the 
provisions of the smelt biological opinion that protects adult Delta 
smelt from the first flush if required to do so by the smelt biological 
opinion.
    (e) Construction.--The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary 
of Commerce are authorized to implement subsection (a) consistent with 
the results of monitoring through Early Warning Surveys to make real 
time operational decisions consistent with the current applicable 
biological opinion.
    (f) Calculation of Reverse Flow in OMR.--Within 180 days of the 
enactment of this subtitle, the Secretary of the Interior is directed, 
in consultation with the California Department of Water Resources, and 
consistent with the smelt biological opinion and the salmonid 
biological opinion, to review, modify, and implement, if appropriate, 
the method used to calculate reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers, for 
implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the smelt 
biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, and any 
succeeding biological opinions.
SEC. 4003. TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR STORM EVENTS.
    (a) In General.--
        (1) Nothing in this subtitle authorizes additional adverse 
    effects on listed species beyond the range of the effects 
    anticipated to occur to the listed species for the duration of the 
    smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion, using the 
    best scientific and commercial data available.
        (2) When consistent with the environmental protection mandate 
    in paragraph (1) while maximizing water supplies for Central Valley 
    Project and State Water Project contractors, the Secretary of the 
    Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, through an operations plan, 
    shall evaluate and may authorize the Central Valley Project and the 
    State Water Project, combined, to operate at levels that result in 
    OMR flows more negative than the most negative reverse flow rate 
    prescribed by the applicable biological opinion (based on United 
    States Geological Survey gauges on Old and Middle Rivers) daily 
    average as described in subsections (b) and (c) to capture peak 
    flows during storm-related events.
    (b) Factors to Be Considered.--In determining additional adverse 
effects on any listed fish species beyond the range of effects 
anticipated to occur to the listed fish species for the duration of the 
smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion, using the best 
scientific and commercial data available, the Secretaries of the 
Interior and Commerce may consider factors including:
        (1) The degree to which the Delta outflow index indicates a 
    higher level of flow available for diversion.
        (2) Relevant physical parameters including projected inflows, 
    turbidity, salinities, and tidal cycles.
        (3) The real-time distribution of listed species.
    (c) Other Environmental Protections.--
        (1) State law.--The actions of the Secretary of the Interior 
    and the Secretary of Commerce under this section shall be 
    consistent with applicable regulatory requirements under State law.
        (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of sediment 
    out of the Delta in each water year, and provided that such 
    determination is based upon objective evidence, the Secretary of 
    the Interior shall manage OMR flow pursuant to the portion of the 
    smelt biological opinion that protects adult Delta smelt from the 
    first flush if required to do so by the smelt biological opinion.
        (3) Applicability of opinion.--This section shall not affect 
    the application of the salmonid biological opinion from April 1 to 
    May 31, unless the Secretary of Commerce finds that some or all of 
    such applicable requirements may be adjusted during this time 
    period to provide emergency water supply relief without resulting 
    in additional adverse effects on listed salmonid species beyond the 
    range of the effects anticipated to occur to the listed salmonid 
    species for the duration of the salmonid biological opinion using 
    the best scientific and commercial data available. In addition to 
    any other actions to benefit water supply, the Secretary of the 
    Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall consider allowing 
    through-Delta water transfers to occur during this period if they 
    can be accomplished consistent with section 3405(a)(1)(H) of the 
    Central Valley Project Improvement Act and other applicable law. 
    Water transfers solely or exclusively through the State Water 
    Project are not required to be consistent with subsection (a)(1)(H) 
    of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.
        (4) Monitoring.--During operations under this section, the 
    Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with the Fish and 
    Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and California 
    Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall undertake expanded 
    monitoring programs and other data gathering to improve the 
    efficiency of operations for listed species protections and Central 
    Valley Project and State Water Project water supply to ensure 
    incidental take levels are not exceeded, and to identify potential 
    negative impacts, if any.
    (d) Effect of High Outflows.--When exercising their authorities to 
capture peak flows pursuant to subsection (c), the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall not count such days toward 
the 5-day and 14-day running averages of tidally filtered daily Old and 
Middle River flow requirements under the smelt biological opinion and 
salmonid biological opinion, unless doing so is required to avoid 
additional adverse effects on listed fish species beyond those 
anticipated to occur through implementation of the smelt biological 
opinion and salmonid biological opinion using the best scientific and 
commercial data available.
    (e) Level of Detail Required for Analysis.--In articulating the 
determinations required under this section, the Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall fully satisfy the 
requirements herein but shall not be expected to provide a greater 
level of supporting detail for the analysis than feasible to provide 
within the short timeframe permitted for timely real-time 
decisionmaking in response to changing conditions in the Delta.
SEC. 4004. CONSULTATION ON COORDINATED OPERATIONS.
    (a) Resolution of Water Resource Issues.--In furtherance of the 
policy established by section 2(c)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 
1973, that Federal agencies shall cooperate with State and local 
agencies to resolve water resource issues in concert with conservation 
of endangered species, in any consultation or reconsultation on the 
coordinated operations of the Central Valley Project and the State 
Water Project, the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce shall 
ensure that any public water agency that contracts for the delivery of 
water from the Central Valley Project or the State Water Project that 
so requests shall--
        (1) have routine and continuing opportunities to discuss and 
    submit information to the action agency for consideration during 
    the development of any biological assessment;
        (2) be informed by the action agency of the schedule for 
    preparation of a biological assessment;
        (3) be informed by the consulting agency, the U.S. Fish and 
    Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, of the 
    schedule for preparation of the biological opinion at such time as 
    the biological assessment is submitted to the consulting agency by 
    the action agency;
        (4) receive a copy of any draft biological opinion and have the 
    opportunity to review that document and provide comment to the 
    consulting agency through the action agency, which comments will be 
    afforded due consideration during the consultation;
        (5) have the opportunity to confer with the action agency and 
    applicant, if any, about reasonable and prudent alternatives prior 
    to the action agency or applicant identifying one or more 
    reasonable and prudent alternatives for consideration by the 
    consulting agency; and
        (6) where the consulting agency suggests a reasonable and 
    prudent alternative be informed--
            (A) how each component of the alternative will contribute 
        to avoiding jeopardy or adverse modification of critical 
        habitat and the scientific data or information that supports 
        each component of the alternative; and
            (B) why other proposed alternative actions that would have 
        fewer adverse water supply and economic impacts are inadequate 
        to avoid jeopardy or adverse modification of critical habitat.
    (b) Input.--When consultation is ongoing, the Secretaries of the 
Interior and Commerce shall regularly solicit input from and report 
their progress to the Collaborative Adaptive Management Team and the 
Collaborative Science and Adaptive Management Program policy group. The

Secretaries with recommendations to improve the effects analysis and 
Federal agency determinations. The Secretaries shall give due 
consideration to the recommendations when developing the Biological 
Assessment and Biological Opinion.
    (c) Meetings.--The Secretaries shall establish a quarterly 
stakeholder meeting during any consultation or reconsultation for the 
purpose of providing updates on the development of the Biological 
Assessment and Biological Opinion. The quarterly stakeholder meeting 
shall be open to stakeholders identified by the Secretaries 
representing a broad range of interests including environmental, 
recreational and commercial fishing, agricultural, municipal, Delta, 
and other regional interests, and including stakeholders that are not 
state or local agencies.
    (d) Clarification.--Neither subsection (b) or (c) of this section 
may be used to meet the requirements of subsection (a).
    (e) Non-applicability of FACA.--For the purposes of subsection (b), 
the Collaborative Adaptive Management Team, the Collaborative Science 
and Adaptive Management Program policy group, and any recommendations 
made to the Secretaries, are exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act.

    scientific and commercial data available to implement, continuously 
    evaluate, and refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable and 
    prudent alternative described in the smelt biological opinion.
        (2) Increased monitoring to inform real-time operations.--
            (A) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
        conduct additional surveys, on an annual basis at the 
        appropriate time of year based on environmental conditions, in 
        collaboration with interested stakeholders regarding the 
        science of the Delta in general, and to enhance real time 
        decisionmaking in particular, working in close coordination 
        with relevant State authorities.
            (B) Requirements.--In carrying out this subsection, the 
        Secretary of the Interior shall use--
                (i) the most appropriate and accurate survey methods

            extent to which adult Delta smelt are distributed in 
            relation to certain levels of turbidity or other 
            environmental factors that may influence salvage rate;
                (ii) results from appropriate surveys for the detection 
            of Delta smelt to determine how the Central Valley Project 
            and State Water Project may be operated more efficiently to 
            maximize fish and water supply benefits; and
                (iii) science-based recommendations developed by any of 
            the persons or entities described in paragraph (4)(B) to

            (C) Winter monitoring.--During the period between December 
        1 and March 31, if suspended sediment loads enter the Delta 
        from the Sacramento River, and the suspended sediment loads 
        appear likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old River north 
        of the export pumps from values below 12 Nephelometric 
        Turbidity Units (NTUs) to values above 12 NTUs, the Secretary 
        of the Interior shall--

    subtitle and between the United States and a water users' 
    association to allow for prepayment of the repayment contract 
    pursuant to paragraph (2) under mutually agreeable terms and 
    conditions. The manner of conversion under this paragraph shall be 
    as follows:
            (A) Water service contracts that were entered into under 
        section (e) of the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 Stat. 1196), to be

            (B) The contract shall require that construction costs or 
        other capitalized costs incurred after the effective date of 
        the contract or not reflected in the rate schedule referenced 
        in subparagraph (A), and properly assignable to such 
        contractor, shall be repaid in not more than 5 years after 
        notification of the allocation if such amount is a result of a 
        collective annual allocation of capital costs to the

        and their landowners as provided under State law.
    (b) Accounting.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary of the Interior. In the event that the final cost allocation 
indicates that the costs properly assignable to the contractor are 
greater than what has been paid by the contractor, the contractor shall 
be obligated to pay the remaining allocated costs. The term of such 
additional repayment contract shall be not less than one year and not 
more than 10 years, however, mutually agreeable provisions regarding 
the rate of repayment of such amount may be developed by the parties. 
In the event that the final cost allocation indicates that the costs 
properly assignable to the contractor are less than what the contractor 
has paid, the Secretary shall credit such overpayment as an offset 
against any outstanding or future obligation of the contractor, with 
the exception of Restoration Fund charges pursuant to section 3407(d)
