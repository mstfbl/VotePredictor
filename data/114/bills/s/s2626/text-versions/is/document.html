plans and policies of the Federal Aviation Administration, including 
this subtitle and any regulations, policies, advisory circulars, or

aircraft system with the Federal Aviation Administration, if the 
operation of that unmanned aircraft system meets the requirements of 
subsection (b).
    ``(b) Requirements.--The operation of an unmanned aircraft system 
by an institution of higher education meets the requirements of this 
subsection if--
            ``(1) the institution has established and adopted a policy 
        relating to unmanned aircraft systems to ensure safe operation 
        of such systems, which may be a policy of more general 
        applicability in effect before the date of the enactment of 
        this section, but that shall include--
                    ``(A) designation of a point of contact at the
