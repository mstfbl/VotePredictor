United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transparent Ratings on Usability and 
Security to Transform Information Technology Act of 2015'' or the 
``TRUST IT Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    Section 3000 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300jj) is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (14) as 
        paragraphs (12) through (16), respectively; and

            ``(10) Information blocking.--The term `information 
        blocking' means, with respect to the development, 
        configuration, implementation, and use of qualified electronic 
        health records and other health information technology, 
        business, technical, and organizational practices that--
                    ``(A) except as required by law, prevent or 
                materially discourage the access, exchange, or use of 
                electronic health information; and

                of electronic health information.
            ``(11) Interoperability.--The term `interoperability' means 
        the ability of 2 or more health information systems or 
        components to exchange clinical and other information and to

        standards to provide access to longitudinal or requested 
        information to health care providers, patients, and other 
        authorized users when such persons need such information in 
        order to facilitate coordinated care and improved patient 
        outcomes.''.
