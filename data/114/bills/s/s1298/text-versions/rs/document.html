SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) America's ports play a critical role in the Nation's 
        transportation supply chain network.
            (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods through the 
        Nation's ports ensures that American goods are available to 
        customers throughout the world.
            (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain network, 
        particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in tremendous 
        economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and retailers that 
        rely on timely shipments.
            (4) A clear understanding of port productivity and 
        throughput would help--
                    (A) to identify freight bottlenecks;
                    (B) to indicate performance and trends over time; 
                and
                    (C) to inform investment decisions.
