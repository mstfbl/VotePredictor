                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize a program for 
 early detection, diagnosis, and treatment regarding deaf and hard-of-
             hearing newborns, infants, and young children.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may cited as the ``Early Hearing Detection and 
Intervention Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, 
        and young children require access to specialized early 
        intervention providers and programs in order to help them meet 
        their linguistic and cognitive potential.
            (2) Families of deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, 
        toddlers, and young children benefit from comprehensive early 
        intervention programs that assist them in supporting their 
        child's development in all domains.
            (3) Best practices principles for early intervention for 
        deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and young 
        children have been identified in a range of areas including 
        listening and spoken language and visual and signed language 
        acquisition, family-to-family support, support from individuals 
        who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, progress monitoring, and 
        others.
            (4) Effective hearing screening and early intervention 
        programs must be in place to identify hearing levels in deaf 
        and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and young 
        children so that they may access appropriate early intervention 
        programs in a timely manner.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF PROGRAM FOR EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND 
              TREATMENT REGARDING DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING NEWBORNS, 
              INFANTS, AND YOUNG CHILDREN.

amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 399M. EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT REGARDING DEAF
