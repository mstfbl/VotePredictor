            ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (c)'';

        the following: ``the Secretary--
                    ``(A) through'';
            (3) by striking ``section 403(c), and (2) in any case where 
        such guidelines under clause (1) alone'' and inserting the 
        following: ``section 403(c); and

            ``(2) Limitation.--Guidelines under paragraph (1) may not 
        prohibit the specification of a site due to the lack of a final 
        site plan resulting from the lack of an identified end user or 
        industry or industrial classification for the site when 
        determining whether there is a practicable alternative to a 
        proposed discharge that would result in less adverse impact on 
        the aquatic ecosystem.''.
                                 <all>
