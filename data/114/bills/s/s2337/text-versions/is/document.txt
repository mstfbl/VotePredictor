        years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the

                traveler's machine readable, electronic passport, 
                before the prospective traveler boards a conveyance 
                bound for the United States; and
                    (C) to inform the Department of Homeland Security 
                of--
                            (i) the results of the comparison described 
                        in subparagraph (B) before the prospective 
                        traveler boards a conveyance bound for the
