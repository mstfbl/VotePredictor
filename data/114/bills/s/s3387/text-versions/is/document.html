    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safely Advancing Valuable and

SEC. 2. FAST TRACK REVIEW FOR CERTAIN GENERIC DRUGS.

    Section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 355(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(11)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
        Secretary shall prioritize the review of a qualifying 
        application under this subsection and shall, within 150 days of 
        the initial receipt of such qualifying application, take final 
        agency action on the application.
            ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `qualifying 
        application' means an application--
                    ``(i) that does not contain a certification under 
                subclause (IV) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii);
                    ``(ii) that may contain a certification under 
                subclause (III) of paragraph (2)(A)(vii) only if such 
                certification asserts that an existing patent will 
                expire not more than 5 months after the date of such 
                certification;
                    ``(iii) for a drug where the reference drug is a 
                drug for which there is no exclusivity period in 
                effect, including an exclusivity period under paragraph 
                (5)(F), or under section 505A, section 527, or section 
                505E; and
                    ``(iv) for a drug where the reference drug has not 
                been the reference drug for more than one other drug 
                that--
                            ``(I) is approved under this subsection; 
                        and
                            ``(II) has been introduced into interstate 
                        commerce in the 3-month period preceding the 
                        date of the qualifying application.
            ``(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph 
        and regardless of the date of submission, a qualifying 
        application shall lose status as an application for priority 
        review, and the Secretary's timeline for taking action on such 
        an application described in subparagraph (A) shall no longer 
        apply, if the application no longer meets the definition of a 
        qualifying application.''.
