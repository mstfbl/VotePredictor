                   Subtitle A--Drought Relief Actions

SEC. 101. EMERGENCY OPERATIONS.

    (a) Water Supplies.--
            (1) In general.--In response to the declaration of a state 
        of drought emergency by the Governor of the State, the 
        Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce shall 
        provide the maximum quantity of water supplies possible to 
        Central Valley Project agricultural, municipal and industrial, 
        and refuge service and repayment contractors, State Water 
        Project contractors, and any other locality or municipality in 
        the State by approving, consistent with applicable laws 
        (including regulations), projects and operations to provide 
        additional water supplies as quickly as possible, based on 
        available information, to address the emergency conditions.
            (2) Application.--Paragraph (1) applies to any project or 
        operation involving the Klamath Project, if the project or 
        operation would benefit Federal water contractors in the State.
    (b) Limitation.--Nothing in this section allows any Federal 
department or agency to approve a project--
            (1) that would otherwise require congressional 
        authorization; or
            (2) without following procedures required by applicable 
        law.
    (c) Administration.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary 
of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce shall, consistent with 
applicable laws (including regulations)--
            (1) authorize and implement actions to ensure that the 
        Delta Cross Channel Gates shall remain open to the greatest 
        extent possible, timed to maximize the peak flood tide period 
        and provide water supply and water quality benefits for the 
        duration of the drought emergency declaration of the State, 
        consistent with operational criteria and monitoring criteria 
        developed pursuant to the California State Water Resources 
        Control Board's Order Approving a Temporary Urgency Change in 
        License and Permit Terms in Response to Drought Conditions, 
        effective January 31, 2014 (or a successor order);
            (2) collect data associated with the operation of the Delta 
        Cross Channel Gates described in paragraph (1) and the impact 
        of the operation on species listed as threatened or endangered 
        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
        seq.), water quality, and water supply;
            (3)(A) implement turbidity control strategies that allow 
        for increased water deliveries while avoiding jeopardy to adult 
        Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) due to entrainment at 
        Central Valley Project and State Water Project pumping plants; 
        and
            (B) manage reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers, as 
        prescribed by the smelt biological opinion and salmonid 
        biological opinion, to minimize water supply reductions for the 
        Central Valley Project and the State Water Project;
            (4)(A) in a timely manner, evaluate any proposal to 
        increase flow in the San Joaquin River through a voluntary 
        sale, transfer, or exchange of water from an agency with rights 
        to divert water from the San Joaquin River or its tributaries; 
        and
            (B) adopt a 1:1 inflow to export ratio for the increment of 
        increased flow, as measured as a 3-day running average at 
        Vernalis during the period from April 1 through May 31, that 
        results from the voluntary sale, transfer, or exchange, unless 
        the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Commerce 
        determine that a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for that increment 
        of increased flow will cause impacts on species listed as 
        threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) beyond those anticipated to occur 
        through the implementation of the salmonid biological opinion. 
        Any individual sale, transfer, or exchange using a 1:1 inflow 
        to export ratio adopted under the authority of this section may 
        only proceed if--
                    (i) the Secretary of the Interior determines that 
                the environmental effects of the proposed sale, 
                transfer, or exchange are consistent with effects 
                permitted under applicable law (including the 
                Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et 
                seq.), and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act 
                (California Water Code 13000 et seq.));
                    (ii) Delta conditions are suitable to allow 
                movement of the acquired, transferred, or exchanged 
                water through the Delta consistent with existing water 
                rights; and
                    (iii) such voluntary sale, transfer, or exchange of 
                water results in flow that is in addition to flow that 
                otherwise would occur in the absence of the voluntary 
                sale, transfer, or exchange;
            (5) issue all necessary permit decisions under the 
        authority of the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of 
        Commerce within the shortest practicable time period after 
        receiving a completed application by the State to place and use 
        temporary barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to 
        improve water quantity and quality for State Water Project and 
        Central Valley Project south-of-Delta water contractors and 
        other water users, which barriers or gates shall provide 
        benefits for species protection and in-Delta water user water 
        quality;
            (6) require the Director of the United States Fish and 
        Wildlife Service and the Commissioner of Reclamation to 
        complete all requirements under the National Environmental 
        Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and the Endangered 
        Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) necessary to make 
        final permit decisions on water transfer requests associated 
        with voluntarily fallowing nonpermanent crops in the State, 
        within the shortest practicable time period after receiving 
        such a request;
            (7) in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, 
        enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences 
        to conduct a comprehensive study, to be completed not later 
        than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, on the 
        effectiveness and environmental impacts of saltcedar biological 
        control efforts on increasing water supplies and improving 
        riparian habitats of the Colorado River and its principal 
        tributaries, in the State and elsewhere; and
            (8) use all available scientific tools to identify any 
        changes to real-time operations of Bureau of Reclamation, 
        State, and local water projects that could result in the 
        availability of additional water supplies.

SEC. 203. IMPROVED SCIENCE TO BETTER PROTECT THREATENED AND ENDANGERED 
              FISH.

    (a) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--Not later than January 1, 
2016, contingent on funding, the Secretary of the Interior shall--
            (1) initiate studies designed to understand the location 
        and distribution of Delta smelt throughout the range of the 
        Delta smelt and to determine potential methods to minimize the 
        effects of Central Valley Project and State Water Project 
        operations on the Delta smelt; and

        technologies to allow for better tracking of Delta smelt, such 
        as acoustic tagging, optical recognition during trawls, and 
        fish detection using residual DNA.
            (3) Consultation.--In determining the scope of the studies 
        under this subsection, the Secretary may consult with--
                    (A) Federal and State water users; and

beginning on December 1, 2015, and ending March 31, 2016, and during 
each following December-through-March period for which this Act is in 
effect, if suspended sediment loads enter the Delta from the Sacramento 
River and the suspended sediment loads appear likely to raise turbidity 
levels in Old River north of the export pumps from values below 12 
Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs) to values above 12 NTUs, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate survey 
        methods at locations including the vicinity of Station 902 to 
        determine the extent that adult Delta smelt are moving with 
        turbidity toward the export pumps; and
            (2) use results from the monitoring surveys at locations 
        including the vicinity of Station 902 to determine how 
        increased trawling can inform daily real-time Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project operations to achieve fish 
        protection and water supply benefits.

SEC. 204. ACTIONS TO BENEFIT REFUGES.

    (a) In General.--In addition to funding under section 3407 of the

                    (B) may be provided in cash or in-kind.

               TITLE III--LONG-TERM WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS

                Subtitle A--Desalination and Water Reuse

SEC. 301. WATER RECYCLING AND DESALINATION PROJECTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Federal funding to support water recycling and 
        desalination projects in recent years has been insufficient to 
        address water supply needs in many regions across the United 
        States;
            (2) climate change and drought resiliency require 
        additional water supply projects to cope with higher 
        probabilities of longer more intense droughts;
            (3) the historic drought in California highlights the 
        necessity of long-term projects to address a changing climate;
            (4) a recycled water project national survey conducted by 
        the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the Water 
        Reuse Association, the Association of California Water 
        Agencies, and the California Association of Sanitation Agencies 
        in October 2013 identified 92 projects in 14 States that are 
        under consideration or development by water districts capable 
        of producing up to approximately 900,000 acre-feet of new water 
        supplies if there were sufficient funding or financing tools to 
        facilitate the development of those projects; and
            (5) desalination of both seawater and brackish water has 
        the potential to provide significant new water supplies to 
        regions of the United States vulnerable to drought, as is done 
        in Israel, Australia, and many other countries around the world 
        with scarce water supplies.
    (b) Eligibility for Water Recycling Federal Support.--Upon the 
submission of a completed feasibility report compliant with Bureau of 
Reclamation standards, the Secretary of the Interior shall review 
requests for water recycling project funding assistance and, subject to 
the availability of appropriations, award funding, on a competitive

SEC. 323. ASSISTANCE FOR DROUGHT-STRICKEN COMMUNITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) across the United States, more than 90 percent of the 
        community water systems serve populations of less than 10,000 
        individuals;
            (2) the number of dry wells continues to increase as the 
        State enters the fourth consecutive summer of drought, with 
        approximately 1,988 wells statewide identified as critical or 
        dry, which affects an estimated 9,940 residents, with 1,883 of 
        the 1,988 dry wells concentrated in the inland regions within 
        the Central Valley;
            (3) many areas of the State are disproportionately impacted 
        by drought because the areas are heavily dependent or 
        completely reliant on groundwater from basins that are in 
        overdraft and in which the water table declines year after year 
        or from basins that are contaminated; and
            (4) those communities throughout the State have been 
        impacted by the presence of naturally occurring arsenic in the 
        groundwater among other contaminants, as a result of higher 
        concentration of contaminants in the water.
    (b) Additional Assistance for Communities Without Access to 
Adequate Water.--
            (1) In general.--To assist disadvantaged communities that 
        have experienced a significant decline in quantity or quality 
        of drinking water, and to obtain or maintain adequate 
        quantities of water that meet the standards set by the Federal 
        Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. et seq.), there is 
        established within the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program 
        of the Department of Agriculture a program under which the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall provide grants for communities--
                    (A) that are unable to meet the primary water 
                quality standards under that Act; or
                    (B) the local private or public water supply of 
                which has been lost or severely diminished due to 
                drought conditions.
            (2) Eligible communities.--

                            (ii) has a median household income of less 
                        than 100 percent of a the nonmetropolitan 
                        median household income of the State.
                    (B) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding subparagraph 
                (A)(i), the Secretary may provide assistance to 
                communities exceeding the 10,000 population limit 
                established by that subparagraph in the event there is 
                a threat to the human health and safety of the

                project shall be creditworthy, as determined by the

                project has appropriate security features, such as a 
                rate covenant, to ensure repayment.
                    (B) Preliminary rating opinion letter.--The 
                Secretary shall require each applicant to provide a 
                preliminary rating opinion letter from at least 1 
                rating agency indicating that the senior obligations of 
                the project (which may be the Federal credit 
                instrument) have the potential to achieve an 
                investment-grade rating.
            (2) Eligible project costs.--The eligible project costs of 
        a project shall be reasonably anticipated to be not less than

        a project carried out by an entity that is not a State or local

        government, the project shall be publicly sponsored.
    (b) Selection Criteria.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish criteria 
        for the selection of projects that meet the eligibility 
        requirements of subsection (a), in accordance with paragraph

                or regionally significant.
                    (C) The extent to which assistance under this 
                section would foster innovative public-private 
                partnerships and attract private debt or equity 
                investment.

                            (ii) innovative recycling programs that 
                        augment a combination of industrial, 
                        commercial, residential, and agricultural uses.
                    (E) The likelihood that assistance under this 
                section would enable the project to proceed at an 
                earlier date than the project would otherwise be able 
                to proceed.
                    (F) The amount of budget authority required to fund 
                the Federal credit instrument made available under this

        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue 
        eligibility requirements under title IV of this Act for water

              RECLAMATION, AND RECYCLING PROJECTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the State is currently experiencing an historic drought 
        that has not been witnessed in over 100 years of recorded 
        history, and funding will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to 
        better respond to and mitigate the potential impacts of 
        extended drought and long-term sustainability challenges;
            (2) since WaterSMART was established in 2010, the program 
        has provided approximately $250,000,000 in competitively 
        awarded funding to non-Federal partners, including Indian 
        tribes, water districts, municipalities, and institutions of 
        higher education, which investments have conserved enough water 
        to meet the needs of more than 3,800,000 individuals, allowing 
        every acre-foot of water conserved to be made available for 
        other uses; and
            (3) activities funded under WaterSMART include those 
        critical to meeting the Priority Goal for Climate Change of the 
        Department of the Interior, which includes climate risk 
        assessment activities and related efforts that ensure 
        sustainable water supplies in the western United States.
    (b) Amendment.--Section 9504 of the Omnibus Public Land Management 
Act of 2009 (42 U.S.C. 10368) is amended--
