                                 A BILL


 
  To provide protection for survivors of domestic violence or sexual 
                  assault under the Fair Housing Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Housing for Domestic Violence 
and Sexual Assault Survivors Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cities, towns, and rural communities in the United 
        States continue to face enormous challenges regarding domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other 
        forms of intimate partner violence.
            (2) One in 3 women have experienced rape, physical 
        violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
            (3) Approximately 7,000,000 women are raped or physically 
        assaulted by a current or former intimate partner each year.
            (4) Each day, an average of 3 women are killed by a current 
        or former partner.
            (5) Researchers estimate that domestic violence costs 
        employers up to $13,000,000,000 each year.
            (6) A fundamental component of ending domestic and sexual 
        violence is securing safe and affordable housing for victims.
            (7) Research indicates that--
                    (A) nearly 50 percent of all homeless women report 
                that domestic violence was the immediate cause of their 
                homelessness;
                    (B) 92 percent of homeless women report having 
                experienced severe physical or sexual violence at some 
                point in their lives; and
                    (C) victims become homeless as a result of sexual 
                assault, and once homeless, they are further vulnerable 
                to sexual victimization and exploitation.
            (8) Surveys show that a majority of victims that experience 
        a sexual assault in their home do not relocate to a safe 
        environment because they do not have sufficient funds, and are 
        not aware of better options.
            (9) Domestic and sexual violence victims often find 
        themselves trapped in homes where they are further victimized 
        by caregivers, parents, siblings, landlords, intimate partners, 
        neighbors, or others in or near their home. Economic insecurity 
        and the trauma that often follows sexual assault make it 
        difficult, if not impossible, for many victims to access safe, 
        affordable housing options for themselves and their families.
            (10) Domestic and sexual violence victims continue to face 
        discrimination in securing and maintaining housing based on 
        their status as victims and as a result of crimes committed 
        against them.
            (11) Research by the Attorney General of the State of New 
        York found that 67 percent of domestic violence victims 
        reported that discrimination by landlords is a significant 
        obstacle in obtaining housing.
            (12) Research also shows that victims of domestic violence 
        or sexual assault are commonly denied housing opportunities if 
        a previous residence of the victim was a domestic violence 
        shelter, if the victim has secured a protective order, or if 
        there is other evidence that the victim has experienced a 
        previous domestic violence incident.
            (13) Studies show that victims of domestic violence or 
        sexual assault often face eviction based on a single domestic 
        violence incident.
            (14) It is in the public interest that victims of domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and other 
        forms of intimate partner violence are not discriminated 
        against, particularly with respect to housing, based on their 
        status as victims or the crimes committed against them.
            (15) Nothing in this Act should be interpreted to limit the 
        ability of victims of domestic violence or sexual assault to 
        recover for claims of discrimination on the basis of sex or 
        race under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), 
        including with respect to failure to conform to gender 
        stereotypes or policies that disproportionately affect women.
