    ``(e) No Warranty.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any disclosure relating to participation 
        of a product in the Energy Star program shall not create an 
        express or implied warranty or give rise to any private claims 
        or rights of action under Federal or State law relating to the 
        disqualification of that product from Energy Star if--
                    ``(A) the product has been certified by a 
                certification body recognized by the Energy Star 
                program;
                    ``(B) the Administrator has approved corrective 
                measures, including a determination of whether consumer 
                compensation is appropriate; and

                all approved corrective measures.
            ``(2) No action by administrator necessary.--Nothing in 
        this subsection requires the Administrator to modify any 
        procedure or take any other action.''.
