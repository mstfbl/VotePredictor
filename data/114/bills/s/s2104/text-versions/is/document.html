_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide relief to 
 Medicare Advantage plans with a significant number of dually eligible 
 or low-income subsidy beneficiaries and to prevent the termination of 
                            two star plans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Medicare Advantage for 
all Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the IMPACT Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-185), 
        Congress recognized the potential effects of socioeconomic 
        status and dual eligible populations on the Medicare Advantage 
        STARS rating system by requesting the Assistant Secretary of 
        Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health and Human 
        Services undertake studies on this population and the Medicare 
        program.
            (2) Studies published in the past year have shown the need 
        for an interim policy until the comprehensive results of the 
        studies undertaken as part of the IMPACT Act of 2014 are 
        published. An adjustment for 2016 is necessary while Congress 
        continues to work to achieve an appropriate policy for a 
        temporary bridge until the results from the studies undertaken 
        by the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation in the 
        Department of Health and Human Services under such Act are 
        finalized.

SEC. 3. DELAY IN AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS FOR CERTAIN MEDICARE 
              ADVANTAGE PLANS FAILING TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM QUALITY 
              RATINGS.

    Section 1857(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(h)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) Delay in contract termination authority for certain 
        plans failing to achieve minimum quality rating.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the 
                Secretary may not terminate a contract under this 
                section with respect to the offering of an MA plan by a 
                Medicare Advantage organization solely because the MA 
                plan has failed to achieve a minimum quality rating 
                under the 5-star rating system established under 
                section 1853(o) during the period beginning on the date 
                of the enactment of this paragraph and through the end 
                of plan year 2018.
                    ``(B) Application only to plans receiving a quality 
                rating of at least 2 stars.--Subparagraph (A) shall 
                only apply with respect to a contract with respect to 
                the offering of an MA plan that has a quality rating 
                under section 1853(o)(4) of at least 2 stars for the 
                most recent plan year.''.
