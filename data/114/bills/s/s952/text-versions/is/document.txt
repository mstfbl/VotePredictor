                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 15, 2015

  Ms. Ayotte (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Portman, Mr. Blunt, Mr.

                                 A BILL


 
To provide for duty-free treatment of certain recreational performance 
                   outerwear, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Optimal Use of Trade 
to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation Act'' or the ``U.S. OUTDOOR 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The outdoor industry generates $646,000,000,000 in 
        consumer spending annually and directly supports 6,000,000 
        jobs.
            (2) Outdoor activities are vitally important to the health 
        and well-being of the people of the United States.
            (3) Duty rates on recreational performance apparel are 
        among the highest duty rates imposed by the United States 
        Government, with duties on some recreational performance 
        apparel as high as 28.2 percent.
            (4) The duties currently imposed by the United States on 
        recreational performance apparel were set in an era during 
        which high rates of duty were intended to protect the 
        production of other apparel in the United States, and before 
        the technologies and innovations that create today's 
        recreational performance apparel industry were developed.
            (5) In July 2007, the United States International Trade 
        Commission confirmed, in USITC Publication 3937, that 
        recreational performance apparel produced in the United States 
        makes up less than 1 percent of the total recreational 
        performance apparel market.
            (6) The elimination of duties on the importation of certain 
        recreational performance apparel would provide an economic 
        benefit to United States consumers of outdoor products and 
        would promote increased participation in healthy and active 
        lifestyles.

            ``(ix) The term `multi-adjustable hood or adjustable 
        collar' means, in the case of a hood, a hood into which is

        combination thereof, capable of adsorbing, absorbing, or 
        reacting with human odors, or effective in reducing the growth 
        of odor-causing bacteria.

        cuts, punctures, or similar hazards.
    ``(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(i) of this Note, for purposes 
of this chapter, Notes 1 and 2(a)(1) to chapter 59 and Note 1(c) to 
chapter 60 shall be disregarded in classifying goods as `recreational

maintain internal import records that specify upon entry whether 
garments claimed as recreational performance outerwear have an outer 
surface that is water resistant, treated with plastics, or a 
combination thereof, and shall further enumerate the specific features

performance outerwear.''.
