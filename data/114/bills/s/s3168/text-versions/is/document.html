                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to 
                establish the Stronger Together Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stronger Together School Diversity 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. STRONGER TOGETHER PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating part F as part G; and
            (2) by inserting after part E the following:

                  ``PART F--STRONGER TOGETHER PROGRAM

``SEC. 4551. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Students from low-income families are 6 times more 
        likely to attend high-poverty schools than their more affluent 
        peers.
            ``(2) Racial diversity in schools results in long-term 
        social and academic benefits, including reduced neighborhood, 
        college, and workplace segregation, higher levels of social 
        cohesion, a reduced likelihood of racial prejudice, and the 
        development of skills to navigate and find comfort in racially 
        diverse settings.
            ``(3) Students from low-income families who attend more 
        affluent elementary schools are more likely to perform better 
        academically than similar students who attend high-poverty 
        schools.
            ``(4) Students who attend the most affluent schools are 
        nearly 70 percent more likely to attend college than students 
        who attend the highest-poverty schools, regardless of their 
        socioeconomic background.
            ``(5) Students who attend racially and socioeconomically 
        isolated schools have less access to experienced and qualified 
        teachers, advanced coursework, high-quality instructional 
        materials, and adequate facilities.
            ``(6) According to the Government Accountability Office, as 
        of the 2013-14 school year, 16 percent of our Nation's public 
        elementary schools and secondary schools served student 
        populations comprised of 75 percent or more Black and Hispanic 
        students and 75 percent or more students eligible for free or 
        reduced-price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National 
        School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), an increase of more 
        than 9 percent compared to the percentage of such elementary 
        and secondary schools in the 2000-2001 school year. More than 
        7,700,000 Black students and 12,300,000 Hispanic students 
        attend racially and socioeconomically isolated public 
        elementary schools and secondary schools.
    ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of this part is to support the 
development, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive strategies 
to address the effects of concentrated poverty or racial isolation by 
increasing diversity, including socioeconomic diversity or racial 
diversity, in publicly funded early childhood education programs and 
public elementary schools and secondary schools.

``SEC. 4552. RESERVATION FOR NATIONAL ACTIVITIES.

    ``The Secretary may reserve not more than 5 percent of the amounts

        technical assistance, evaluation, or dissemination activities; 
        or
            ``(2) the development and maintenance of a community of 
        practice for recipients of grants under this part and other 
        experts in the field of school diversity.
