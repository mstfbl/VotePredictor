SECTION 1. NATIONAL BIOENGINEERED FOOD DISCLOSURE STANDARD.
    The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

     ``Subtitle E--National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard

    ``SEC. 291. DEFINITIONS.
    ``In this subtitle:
        ``(1) Bioengineering.--The term `bioengineering', and any 
    similar term, as determined by the Secretary, with respect to a 
    food, refers to a food--
            ``(A) that contains genetic material that has been modified 
        through in vitro recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
        techniques; and
            ``(B) for which the modification could not otherwise be 
        obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature.
        ``(2) Food.--The term `food' means a food (as defined in 
    section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
    321)) that is intended for human consumption.

    Agriculture.
    ``SEC. 292. APPLICABILITY.
    ``(a) In General.--This subtitle shall apply to any claim in a 
disclosure that a food bears that indicates that the food is a 
bioengineered food.

            ``(A) the most predominant ingredient of the food would 
        independently be subject to the labeling requirements under the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.); 
        or
            ``(B)(i) the most predominant ingredient of the food is

    Secretary determines necessary to carry out the standard.
    ``(b) Regulations.--
        ``(1) In general.--A food may bear a disclosure that the food 
    is bioengineered only in accordance with regulations promulgated by 
    the Secretary in accordance with this subtitle.
        ``(2) Requirements.--A regulation promulgated by the Secretary 
    in carrying out this subtitle shall--
            ``(A) prohibit a food derived from an animal to be 
        considered a bioengineered food solely because the animal 
        consumed feed produced from, containing, or consisting of a 
        bioengineered substance;
            ``(B) determine the amounts of a bioengineered substance

    food that has successfully completed the pre-market Federal 
    regulatory review process shall not be treated as safer than, or 
    not as safe as, a non-bioengineered counterpart of the food solely 
    because the food is bioengineered or produced or developed with the 
    use of bioengineering.
    ``(c) Study of Electronic or Digital Link Disclosure.--
        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of

    (1), the Secretary shall solicit and consider comments from the 
    public.
        ``(3) Factors.--The study conducted under paragraph (1) shall 
    consider whether consumer access to the bioengineering disclosure

        networks.

    determines in the study conducted under paragraph (1) that 
    consumers, while shopping, would not have sufficient access to the 
    bioengineering disclosure through electronic or digital disclosure 
    methods, the Secretary, after consultation with food retailers and 
    manufacturers, shall provide additional and comparable options to 
    access the bioengineering disclosure.
    ``(d) Disclosure.--In promulgating regulations under this section, 
the Secretary shall ensure that--
        ``(1) on-package language accompanies--

    collected to carry out the purposes of this subtitle, that 
    information shall be deleted immediately and not used for any other 
    purpose;

    telephone number that provides access to the bioengineering 
    disclosure; and

establish under any authority or continue in effect as to any food in 
interstate commerce any requirement relating to the labeling or 
disclosure of whether a food is bioengineered or was developed or

national bioengineered food disclosure standard under this section that 
is not identical to the mandatory disclosure requirement under that 
standard.
    ``(f) Consistency With Certain Laws.--The Secretary shall consider 
establishing consistency between--

a claim regarding the absence of bioengineering in the food, such as 
``not bioengineered'', ``non-GMO'', or another similar claim.
