                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Federal Communications Commission to commence proceedings 
   related to the resiliency of critical telecommunications networks 
           during times of emergency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This section may be cited as the ``Securing Access to 
Networks in Disasters Act of 2016''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Severe weather and emergencies can have 
        devastating effects on communities large and small, including 
        rural areas and urban centers.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) 10,649 deaths were attributed to weather 
        related causes during 2006 to 2010.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) According to the third national climate 
        assessment, completed in 2014, microclimate weather models 
        predict increased temperatures, and less frequent but more 
        intense storm events.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) In 2015, there were 9,407,571 acres burned in 
        wildfires and the United States Fire Administration spent 
        $1,700,000,000 on wildfire suppression and $2,600,000,000 on 
        all wildfire related budget costs in 2015. Wildfire potential 
        is expected to remain static or increase over the coming fire 
        seasons.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) During times of emergencies such as a natural 
        disaster, severe storm, or act of terrorism, communications 
        networks serve as a vital tool for individuals, 9-1-1 centers, 
        and first responders.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) During times of emergency, it is critical that 
        consumers be able to access cell phone networks, including to 
        contact 9-1-1, even in the event that damage or outage has 
        occurred on their own home network.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Consumer wireless devices are becoming 
        increasingly important to the safety and security of the public 
        during emergencies, whether to contact 9-1-1, receive emergency 
        alerts, communicate with loved ones, or receive vital 
        information like shelter locations using mobile applications 
        and social media platforms.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) In April 2016, major cell phone carriers 
        announced a Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework 
        (referred to in this subsection as the ``Framework'') that 
        outlines reasonable arrangements between the networks for cell 
        phone roaming during disasters, fosters mutual aid during 
        emergencies, and aids in consumer readiness during times of 
        emergency.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) Voluntary agreements similar to the Framework 
        can provide benefits to consumers by offering increased 
        flexibility for carriers to adjust their efforts as technology 
        and the emergency response ecosystem evolves.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) Although the initial Framework reflects 
        agreement among the 5 largest carriers in the Nation, the 
        agreement could potentially be expanded to include, or serve as 
        a model for, other carriers especially those in underserved or 
        rural areas.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) Close coordination among service providers 
        and the public safety community is essential in advance of, 
        during, and following emergencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the voluntary policies outlined in the Wireless Network Resiliency 
Cooperative Framework should be adhered to, to the best of the 
carriers' ability, to aid consumers, 9-1-1 professionals, first 
responders, and local governments, in accessing communication services 
during times of emergency.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
