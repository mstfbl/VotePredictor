                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Federal Communications Commission to commence proceedings 
   related to the resiliency of critical telecommunications networks 
           during times of emergency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This section may be cited as the ``Securing Access to Networks in 
Disasters Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Severe weather and emergencies can have devastating 
        effects on communities large and small, including rural areas 
        and urban centers.
            (2) 10,649 deaths were attributed to weather related causes 
        during 2006 to 2010.
            (3) According to the third national climate assessment, 
        completed in 2014, microclimate weather models predict 
        increased temperatures, and less frequent but more intense 
        storm events.
            (4) In 2015, there were 9,407,571 acres burned in wildfires 
        and the United States Fire Administration spent $1,700,000,000 
        on wildfire suppression and $2,600,000,000 on all wildfire 
        related budget costs in 2015. Wildfire potential is expected to 
        remain static or increase over the coming fire seasons.
            (5) During times of emergencies such as a natural disaster, 
        severe storm, or act of terrorism, communications networks 
        serve as a vital tool for individuals, 9-1-1 centers, and first 
        responders.
            (6) During times of emergency, it is critical that 
        consumers be able to access cell phone networks, including to 
        contact 9-1-1, even in the event that damage or outage has 
        occurred on their own home network.
            (7) Consumer wireless devices are becoming increasingly 
        important to the safety and security of the public during 
        emergencies, whether to contact 9-1-1, receive emergency 
        alerts, communicate with loved ones, or receive vital 
        information like shelter locations using mobile applications 
        and social media platforms.
            (8) In April 2016, major cell phone carriers announced a 
        Wireless Network Resiliency Cooperative Framework (referred to 
        in this subsection as the ``Framework'') that outlines 
        reasonable arrangements between the networks for cell phone 
        roaming during disasters, fosters mutual aid during 
        emergencies, and aids in consumer readiness during times of 
        emergency.
            (9) Voluntary agreements similar to the Framework can 
        provide benefits to consumers by offering increased flexibility 
        for carriers to adjust their efforts as technology and the 
        emergency response ecosystem evolves.
            (10) Although the initial Framework reflects agreement 
        among the 5 largest carriers in the Nation, the agreement could 
        potentially be expanded to include, or serve as a model for, 
        other carriers especially those in underserved or rural areas.
            (11) Close coordination among service providers and the 
        public safety community is essential in advance of, during, and 
        following emergencies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
voluntary policies outlined in the Wireless Network Resiliency 
Cooperative Framework should be adhered to, to the best of the 
carriers' ability, to aid consumers, 9-1-1 professionals, first 
responders, and local governments, in accessing communication services 
during times of emergency.
