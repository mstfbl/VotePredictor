``Sec. 610. Periodic review of rules
    ``(a) Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this section, 
each agency shall publish in the Federal Register and place on its 
website a plan for the periodic review of rules issued by the agency 
which the head of the agency determines have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such determination 
shall be made without regard to whether the agency performed an 
analysis under section 604. The purpose of the review shall be to 
determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or 
should be amended or rescinded, consistent with the stated objectives 
of applicable statutes, to minimize any adverse significant economic 
impacts or maximize any beneficial significant economic impacts on a 
substantial number of small entities. Such plan may be amended by the 
agency at any time by publishing the revision in the Federal Register 
and subsequently placing the amended plan on the agency's website.
    ``(b) The plan shall provide for--
            ``(1) the review of all such agency rules described in 
        subsection (a) existing on the date of the enactment of this 
        section--

                the plan in the Federal Register; and

            ``(2) the review of all such agency rules described in 
        subsection (a) adopted after the date of enactment of this 
        section--
                    ``(A) within 10 years after the publication of the 
                final rule in the Federal Register; and
                    ``(B) every 10 years thereafter.
    ``(c) If the head of the agency determines that completion of the 
review of existing rules is not feasible by the established date, the 
head of the agency shall so certify in a statement published in the 
Federal Register and may extend the review for not longer than 2 years 
after publication of notice of extension in the Federal Register. Such 
certification and notice shall be sent to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and the Congress.
    ``(d) The plan shall include a section that details how an agency 
will conduct outreach to and meaningfully include small businesses 
(including small business concerns owned and controlled by women, small 
business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, and small business 
concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals (as such terms are defined in the Small 
Business Act)) for the purposes of carrying out this section. The 
agency shall include in this section a plan for how the agency will 
contact small businesses and gather their input on existing agency 
rules.
    ``(e) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the 
results of its review pursuant to such plan to the Congress, the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and in the 
case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined 
in section 3502(5) of title 44) to the Administrator of the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and 
Budget. Such report shall include the identification of any rule with 
respect to which the head of the agency made a determination described 
in paragraph (5) or (6) of subsection (f) and a detailed explanation of 
the reasons for such determination.
    ``(f) In reviewing a rule pursuant to subsections (a) through (e), 
the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small 
entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the 
rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent 
possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. 
In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider--
            ``(1) the continued need for the rule;
            ``(2) the nature of complaints received by the agency from 
        small entities concerning the rule;
            ``(3) comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and 
        the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
        Administration;

        economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small 
        entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency 
        determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports 
        that determination in the annual report required under 
        subsection (e);
            ``(7) the length of time since the rule has been evaluated 
        or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or 
        other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule; 
        and

and on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such 
plan. The agency shall include in the publication a solicitation of 
public comments on any further inclusions or exclusions of rules from 
the list, and shall respond to such comments. Such publication shall 
include a brief description of the rule, the reason why the agency 
determined that it has a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a 
final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and request 
comments from the public, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration, and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
concerning the enforcement of the rule.
    ``(h)(1) Not later than 6 months after each date described in 
subsection (b), the Inspector General for each agency shall--

                    ``(A) the violation has the potential to cause 
                serious harm to the public interest;
                    ``(B) failure to impose a civil fine would impede 
                or interfere with the detection of criminal activity;

                    ``(A) In general.--In any case in which the head of 
                an agency determines under paragraph (2)(E) that a 
                violation presents a danger to the public health or 
                safety, the head of the agency may, notwithstanding 
                paragraph (2)(E), determine not to impose a civil fine 
                on the small business concern if the violation is 
                corrected not later than 24 hours after receipt by the 
                owner of the small business concern of notification of 
                the violation in writing.

                violation under subparagraph (A), the head of the 
                agency shall notify Congress regarding the 
                determination not later than 60 days after the date on 
                which the civil fine is imposed by the agency.

                to any violation by a small business concern of a 
                requirement regarding collection of information by an 
                agency if the small business concern previously 
                violated any requirement regarding collection of 
                information by the agency.
                    ``(B) Other agencies.--For purposes of making a 
                determination under subparagraph (A), the head of an 
                agency shall not take into account any violation of a 
                requirement regarding collection of information by 
                another agency.''.

            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) If, after publication of the certification required 
        under paragraph (1), the head of the agency determines that 
        there will be a significant economic impact on a substantial 
        number of small entities, the agency shall comply with the 
        requirements of section 603 before the publication of the final 
        rule, by--
                    ``(A) publishing an initial regulatory flexibility 
                analysis for public comment; or

                regulatory flexibility analysis.
            ``(3) The head of an agency may not make a certification 
        relating to a rule under this subsection, unless the head of 
        the agency has determined--
                    ``(A) the average cost of the rule for small 
                entities affected or reasonably presumed to be affected 
                by the rule;

        providing the factual basis for the certification under 
        paragraph (1), the head of an agency shall--
                    ``(A) transmit a copy of the certification and 
                statement to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the 
                Small Business Administration; and
