                                 A BILL


 
             To modernize the regulation of nuclear energy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation 
and Modernization Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) the safe and secure operation of nuclear 
        reactors in the United States must remain the paramount focus 
        of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the 
        United States is operating safely and securely;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) nuclear energy is the largest source of 
        affordable, reliable, emissions-free energy in the United 
        States, providing approximately 20 percent of the electricity 
        consumed in the United States and 60 percent of emissions-free 
        electricity generation in the United States;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) provides approximately 500 permanent 
                jobs;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) pays approximately $40,000,000 
                annually in wages;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) generates approximately $470,000,000 
                annually in goods and services in the local community; 
                and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (D) pays approximately $83,000,000 
                annually in Federal, State, and local taxes;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) nuclear energy is of critical importance to 
        United States energy security and worldwide influence on 
        nonproliferation;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) nuclear energy uses widely available fuel 
        resources to enable scientific progress, emissions-free and 
        reliable electricity generation, heat generation for industrial 
        applications, and power for deep space exploration;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) the private sector, the National Laboratories 
        (as defined in section 2 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 
        U.S.C. 15801)), and institutions of higher education are 
        pursuing innovations in nuclear energy technology that will 
        play a crucial role in--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) the future global and United States 
                energy supply; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) the exports, manufacturing, and 
                economy of the United States;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) eventual deployment of commercial advanced 
        nuclear reactors will require--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) modernizing the regulatory framework; 
                and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) making other necessary changes to 
                facilitate the efficient, predictable, and affordable 
                deployment of advanced nuclear reactor 
                technologies;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) 2 impediments to the commercialization of 
        advanced nuclear reactors are the high costs and long durations 
        associated with applying the existing nuclear regulatory 
        framework to advanced nuclear reactors;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) license application reviews should be as 
        predictable and efficient as practicable without compromising 
        safety or security;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) the existing nuclear regulatory framework and 
        the requirements of that framework have not adapted to advances 
        in scientific understanding or the features and performance 
        characteristics of advanced nuclear reactor designs;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) the existing nuclear reactor licensing 
        process does not provide iterative feedback to manage risk as 
        needed for typical technology development and investment 
        cycles;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (13) a staged licensing structure that provides 
        clear and periodic feedback to applicants on an agreed schedule 
        will help to enable the commercialization of safer and 
        innovative technologies that will benefit the economy, national 
        security, and environment of the United States;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (14) a technology-inclusive Commission regulatory 
        framework will--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) allow greater technological 
                innovation; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) enable inventors, scientists, 
                engineers, and students to pursue licensing advanced 
                reactor concepts;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (15) further preparation by the Commission of the 
        research and test reactor licensing process will enable the 
        Commission to more efficiently process applications for 
        research and test reactors when the applications are 
        received;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (16) it is incumbent on the Commission--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) to budget for adequate resources to 
                conduct licensing reviews and other work requested by 
                licensees and applicants; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) to preserve those budgeted funds to 
                ensure responsiveness to licensees and applicants in 
                recognition of the dependence of the licensees and 
                applicants on Commission approval before the benefits 
                of the technology of the licensees and applicants can 
                be realized; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (17) both prospective commercial advanced nuclear 
        reactor applicants and the existing fleet of nuclear reactors 
        in the United States would benefit from modernizing the 
        outdated fee recovery structure of the Commission to better 
        manage fluctuations in workload and the number of licensees in 
        a fair and equitable manner.</DELETED>

        regulatory processes necessary to allow innovation and the 
        commercialization of advanced nuclear reactors; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) a revised fee recovery structure to ensure the 
        availability of resources to meet industry needs without 
        burdening existing licensees unfairly for inaccurate workload 
        projections or premature existing reactor closures.</DELETED>

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation and 
Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the safe and secure operation of nuclear reactors in 
        the United States must remain the paramount focus of the 
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission;
            (2) the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the United 
        States is operating safely and securely;
            (3) nuclear energy is the largest source of affordable, 
        reliable, emissions-free energy in the United States, providing

        reactors when the applications are received;
            (17) it is incumbent on the Commission--
                    (A) to budget appropriate resources to undertake an 
                active role in design familiarization activities with 
                potential applicants with advanced reactor designs;
                    (B) to budget for adequate resources to conduct 
                licensing reviews and other work requested by licensees 
                and applicants; and
                    (C) to preserve those budgeted funds to ensure 
                responsiveness to licensees and applicants in 
                recognition of the dependence of the licensees and 
                applicants on Commission approval before the benefits 
                of the technology of the licensees and applicants can 
                be realized; and
            (18) both prospective advanced nuclear reactor applicants 
        and the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the United States 
        would benefit from modernizing the outdated fee recovery 
        structure of the Commission to better manage fluctuations in 
        workload and the number of licensees in a fair and equitable 
        manner.

            (2) a revised fee recovery structure to ensure the 
        availability of resources to meet industry needs without 
        burdening existing licensees unfairly for inaccurate workload 
        projections or premature existing reactor closures.
