_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
             To modernize the regulation of nuclear energy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Energy Innovation and 
Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the safe and secure operation of nuclear reactors in 
        the United States must remain the paramount focus of the 
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission;
            (2) the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the United 
        States is operating safely and securely;
            (3) nuclear energy is the largest source of affordable, 
        reliable, emissions-free energy in the United States, providing 
        approximately 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the 
        United States and 60 percent of emissions-free electricity 
        generation in the United States;
            (4) a 1,000-megawatt nuclear plant--
                    (A) provides approximately 500 permanent jobs;
                    (B) pays approximately $40,000,000 annually in 
                wages;
                    (C) generates approximately $470,000,000 annually 
                in goods and services in the local community; and
                    (D) pays approximately $83,000,000 annually in 
                Federal, State, and local taxes;
            (5) nuclear energy is of critical importance to United 
        States energy security and worldwide influence on 
        nonproliferation;
            (6) nuclear energy uses widely available fuel resources to 
        enable scientific progress, emissions-free and reliable 
        electricity generation, heat generation for industrial 
        applications, and power for deep space exploration;
            (7) the private sector, the National Laboratories (as 
        defined in section 2 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 
        U.S.C. 15801)), and institutions of higher education are 
        pursuing innovations in nuclear energy technology that will 
        play a crucial role in--
                    (A) the future global and United States energy 
                supply; and
                    (B) the exports, manufacturing, and economy of the 
                United States;
            (8) eventual deployment of commercial advanced nuclear 
        reactors will require--
                    (A) modernizing the regulatory framework; and
                    (B) making other necessary changes to facilitate 
                the efficient, predictable, and affordable deployment 
                of advanced nuclear reactor technologies;
            (9) 2 impediments to the commercialization of advanced 
        nuclear reactors are the high costs and long durations 
        associated with applying the existing nuclear regulatory 
        framework to advanced nuclear reactors;
            (10) license application reviews should be as predictable 
        and efficient as practicable without compromising safety or 
        security;
            (11) the existing nuclear regulatory framework and the 
        requirements of that framework have not adapted to advances in 
        scientific understanding or the features and performance 
        characteristics of advanced nuclear reactor designs;
            (12) the existing nuclear reactor licensing process does 
        not provide iterative feedback to manage risk as needed for 
        typical technology development and investment cycles;
            (13) a staged licensing structure that provides clear and 
        periodic feedback to applicants on an agreed schedule will help 
        to enable the commercialization of safer and innovative 
        technologies that will benefit the economy, national security, 
        and environment of the United States;
            (14) a technology-inclusive Commission regulatory framework 
        will--
                    (A) allow greater technological innovation; and
                    (B) enable inventors, scientists, engineers, and 
                students to pursue licensing advanced reactor concepts;
            (15) further preparation by the Commission of the research 
        and test reactor licensing process will enable the Commission 
        to more efficiently process applications for research and test 
        reactors when the applications are received;
            (16) it is incumbent on the Commission--
                    (A) to budget for adequate resources to conduct 
                licensing reviews and other work requested by licensees 
                and applicants; and
                    (B) to preserve those budgeted funds to ensure 
                responsiveness to licensees and applicants in 
                recognition of the dependence of the licensees and 
                applicants on Commission approval before the benefits 
                of the technology of the licensees and applicants can 
                be realized; and
            (17) both prospective commercial advanced nuclear reactor 
        applicants and the existing fleet of nuclear reactors in the 
        United States would benefit from modernizing the outdated fee 
        recovery structure of the Commission to better manage 
        fluctuations in workload and the number of licensees in a fair 
        and equitable manner.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to provide--
            (1) a program to develop the expertise and regulatory 
        processes necessary to allow innovation and the 
        commercialization of advanced nuclear reactors; and
            (2) a revised fee recovery structure to ensure the 
        availability of resources to meet industry needs without 
        burdening existing licensees unfairly for inaccurate workload 
        projections or premature existing reactor closures.
