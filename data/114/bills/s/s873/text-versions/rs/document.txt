    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jay S. Hammond Wilderness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) on July 21, 1922, Jay Sterner Hammond was born in Troy, 
        New York;
            (2) Hammond studied petroleum engineering at Penn State 
        University, where he was a member of the Triangle Fraternity;
            (3) Hammond later served as a Marine Corps fighter pilot, 
        serving--
                    (A) during World War II with the famous Black Sheep 
                Squadron in the South Pacific; and
                    (B) in China from 1945-1946;
            (4) after leaving military service, Hammond flew to Alaska, 
        where Hammond worked as a Bush pilot, trapper, guide, and 
        laborer;
            (5) a war-related illness caused Hammond to enroll at the 
        University of Alaska, Fairbanks, where Hammond earned his 
        degree in biological sciences in 1949;
            (6) after graduating from the University of Alaska, 
        Fairbanks, Hammond went to work as a biologist, field agent, 
        and hunter for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;
            (7) in 1950, Hammond was transferred to Southwest Alaska, 
        where Hammond--
                    (A) conducted predator and prey studies on the 
                caribou herd of the Alaska Peninsula; and
                    (B) conducted fisheries enforcement efforts out of 
                Dillingham as a pilot;
            (8) Hammond--
                    (A) was 1 of the first people to count 64 brown 
                bears at McNeil River in Southwest Alaska; and
                    (B) once recorded nearly 500,000 Black Brant geese 
                eclipsing the sun at Izembek Bay;
            (9) Hammond later cruised the entire shoreline of 45-mile-
        long Lake Clark counting wildlife and finding a future 
        homestead site on the shore of Lake Clark;
            (10) upon Alaska entering the Union in 1959, Hammond ran 
        and won election to the Alaska State House of Representatives;
            (11) Hammond served as an independent in the Alaska State 
        House of Representatives from 1959 to 1965;

        Republican;

        Bristol Bay Borough;
            (15) during the 1960s and early 1970s, Hammond served as 
        the manager of Bristol Bay Borough during periods in which the 
        State legislature was not in session;
            (16) in 1974, Hammond was drafted by friends to run for 
        Governor of Alaska, defeating former Republican Walter J. 
        Hickel in the primary, and defeating the first Governor of the 
        State, Democrat William A. Egan, in the general election;
            (17) the 1974 campaign for Governor was dominated by--
                    (A) the opposition of Hammond to oil leasing in 
                Kachemak Bay;
                    (B) concern about State salmon fisheries and 
                environmental management; and
                    (C) fear about State overspending after the 
                discovery of oil on the North Slope;

                by a mere 221 votes after 2 recounts;
            (19) in 1978, Hammond again defeated Walter J. Hickel in 
        the Republican primary by 98 votes, the closest margin in a 
        statewide election in the history of Alaska;
            (20) Hammond defeated Walter J. Hickel, a write-in 
        candidate, and Democrat Chancy Croft in the 1978 General 
        Election by 16,000 votes;
            (21) as Governor, Hammond--

                    (C) authored the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend

                Permanent Fund;

                reserve;
                    (E) opposed the repeal of the State income tax;
                    (F) championed agricultural development in Interior 
                Alaska; and
                    (G) oversaw the purchase of the Alaska Railroad by 
                the State;
            (22) with respect to environmental issues, Hammond--
                    (A) opposed construction of a proposed Ramparts 
                hydroelectric dam on the Yukon River;
                    (B) supported the congressional creation of a 200-
                mile fisheries zone off the coast of the State, which 
                improved State fishery stocks;
                    (C) oversaw the creation of a limited entry

                wilderness; and
                    (E) in 1980, as Governor, oversaw the enactment of 
                the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 
                U.S.C. 3101 et seq.), which--
                            (i) dissolved the placement of 120,000,000 
                        acres of Alaska into protected status under

                        National Park and Preserve, bringing to 
                        54,000,000 acres the total size of National

                        Wild and Scenic Rivers System running 3,131

        in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, in which the 
        homestead of Hammond is located, would--
                    (A) honor Hammond; and
                    (B) be a fitting tribute to the honorable life and

                example of a true public servant . . . there are few 
                men who have influence through their quiet articulation 
                of what is right and fair in the way of Jay Hammond''.
