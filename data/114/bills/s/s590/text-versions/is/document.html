                employee's rights and options, as described in clauses 
                (ii) through (vii) of section 485(f)(8)(B).

        that is focused on the experience of the victim, that does not 
        judge or blame the reporting student or employee for the 
        alleged assault, and that is informed by evidence-based 
        research on the neurobiology of trauma. The victim shall be 
        given the option to have the interview recorded and to receive 
        a copy of the recorded interview.

                        education responsible employee, the option to 
                        notify local law enforcement, and any other 
                        reporting options;
