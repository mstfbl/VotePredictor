                nationality or, in the case of a person having no 
                nationality, is outside any country in which such

        group whose members share a characteristic that is either 
        immutable or fundamental to identity, conscience, or the 
        exercise of the person's human rights such that the person

        notice and allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to file 
        such evidence. The trier of fact may not require such evidence 
        if the applicant does not have the evidence and demonstrates 
        that he or she cannot reasonably obtain the evidence. Evidence 
        shall not be considered reasonably obtainable if procurement of 
        such evidence would reasonably endanger the life or safety of 
        any person.'';

                        nationality, particular social group, or 
                        political opinion, may establish that 
                        persecution is on account of one of the grounds 
                        enumerated in subsection (a)(42)(A)(i)(II).''; 
                        and
            (5) in clause (iv), as redesignated, by striking ``,

        other relevant factor.'' and inserting ``. If the trier of fact 
        determines that there are inconsistencies or omissions, the

        notice and allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to file 
        such evidence. The trier of fact may not require such evidence 
        if the applicant does not have the evidence and demonstrates 
        that he or she cannot reasonably obtain the evidence. Evidence 
        shall not be considered reasonably obtainable under this 
        subparagraph if procurement of such evidence would reasonably 
        endanger the life or safety of any person in the applicant's 
        home country.''; and

        and inserting ``. If the trier of fact determines that there 
        are inconsistencies or omissions, the alien shall be given an

        abuse of discretion, or not supported by substantial evidence. 
        The court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the 
        administrative record on which the order of removal is 
        based.''.

                pursuant to procedures established in accordance with

                asylum officer shall conduct a nonadversarial asylum 
                interview and, after seeking supervisorial review, may 
                grant asylum to the alien under section 208 or refer

nongovernmental community-based organizations to meet the requirements 
under subsection (a).

        determining whether to use secure alternatives, the Secretary--
