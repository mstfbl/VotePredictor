submit to the Committees on Appropriations and Energy and Natural 
Resources of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations and

        reasonably be provided to the legal boundaries of the land in a 
        manner that minimizes the impact on wildlife habitat and water

        and egress, including acquiring an easement, right-of-way, or

        or the need to coordinate with State land management agencies 
        or other Federal, State, or tribal governments to allow for

            (2) on foot or horseback.

            (1) In general.--This section shall have no effect on 
        whether a particular recreational use shall be allowed on the 
        land included in a priority list under this section.
            (2) Effect of allowable uses on agency consideration.--In 
        preparing the priority list under subsection (b), the Secretary 
        shall only consider recreational uses that are allowed on the 
        land at the time that the priority list is prepared.
