SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Energy Efficiency Act''.

SEC. 2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESOURCE STANDARD FOR RETAIL ELECTRICITY AND 
              NATURAL GAS SUPPLIERS.

    (a) In General.--Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies 
Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
the following:

``SEC. 610. FEDERAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESOURCE STANDARD FOR RETAIL

                respect to a retail electricity supplier or retail 
                natural gas supplier, means, for each calendar year for 
                which a performance standard is established under 
                subsection (c), the average annual quantity of 
                electricity or natural gas delivered by the retail 
                electricity supplier or retail natural gas supplier to 
                retail customers during the 3 calendar years 
                immediately preceding the first year that compliance is
