SEC. 8. GAO REPORT.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study on the effectiveness of priority review vouchers under 
section 565A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by 
section 7) in providing incentives for the development of material 
threat medical countermeasures applications under such section 565A. In 
conducting such study, the Comptroller General shall examine the 
following:
            (1) The impact of the priority review voucher in attracting 
        investment into the development of material threat medical 
        countermeasures and the impact of such investment, as 
        applicable, on the development of such countermeasures.
            (2) How the drugs for which priority review vouchers were 
        awarded under such section 565A--
                    (A) addressed identified medical countermeasure 
                needs; and
                    (B) impacted United States preparedness against 
                chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
                threats, including both identified threats and 
                naturally-occurring threats.
            (3) How many material threat medical countermeasures were 
        licensed or approved, or otherwise significantly advanced in 
        clinical development, in the 10 years following the enactment 
        of such section 565A compared to the 10 years prior to the 
        enactment of such section.
            (4) An analysis of the drugs for which such priority review 
        vouchers were used, which shall include--
                    (A) the indications for which such drugs were 
                approved under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, 
                Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 
                351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
                262);
                    (B) whether unmet medical needs were addressed 
                through the approval of such drugs, including, for each 
                such drug--
                            (i) if an alternative therapy was 
                        previously available to treat the indication; 
                        and
                            (ii) if the drug provided a benefit or 
                        advantage over another available therapy;
                    (C) the value of the priority review voucher if 
                transferred; and
                    (D) the length of time between the date on which a 
                priority review voucher was awarded and the date on 
                which it was used.
            (5) With respect to the priority review voucher program 
        under such section 565A--
                    (A) how many priority review vouchers were awarded 
                under such section 565A and how many of such awarded 
                vouchers were redeemed for priority review of a drug 
                application in the 10 years following the date of 
                enactment of such section;
                    (B) the resources associated with the Food and Drug 
                Administration implementation of such section 565A and 
                review of applications for which a voucher awarded 
                under such section 565A is redeemed for priority 
                review; and
                    (C) recommendations, if any, with respect to how 
                such section 565A could be improved to better achieve 
                the objective of incentivizing the timely development 
                of medical countermeasures to address identified 
                chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear 
                threats, including for medical countermeasures that 
                might otherwise not be developed, potentially eligible 
                for an emergency use authorization, licensed, or 
                approved.
    (b) Consultations.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Comptroller General of the United States shall consult with--
            (1) drug manufacturers involved in the research and 
        development of medical countermeasures to address biological, 
        chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats;
            (2) stakeholders involved in investing in the research and 
        development of medical countermeasures, including venture 
        capitalists;
            (3) the Federal Government agencies responsible for 
        advancing, reviewing, and procuring medical countermeasures, 
        including--

                including the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
                Preparedness and Response, the Biomedical Advanced 
                Research and Development Authority, and the Food and 
                Drug Administration; and
                    (B) the Department of Defense; and
            (4) biodefense stakeholders, as applicable.
    (c) Initial Assessment.--Not later than 7 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 
of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
Representatives an initial assessment of the effectiveness of the 
priority review voucher program set forth in section 565A of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by section 7).
    (d) Report.--Not later than 12 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate 
and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
Representatives a report containing the results of the study conducted 
under subsection (a).
    (e) Protection of National Security.--The Comptroller General of 
the United States shall conduct the study and issue the assessment and 
report under this section in a manner that does not compromise national 
security.
