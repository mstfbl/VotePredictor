                                 A BILL


 
 To protect consumers from deceptive practices with respect to online 
         booking of hotel reservations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Online Booking Scams Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Internet has become an important channel of 
        commerce in the United States, accounting for billions of 
        dollars in retail sales every year.
            (2) Hotel reservation transactions can be easily made 
        online and online commerce has created a marketplace where 
        consumers can shop for hotels, flights, car rentals, and other 
        travel-related services and products across thousands of brands 
        on a single platform.
            (3) Consumers should have the utmost clarity as to the 
        company with which such consumers are transacting business 
        online.
            (4) Actions by third-party sellers that misappropriate 
        brand identity, trademark, or other marketing content are 
        harmful to consumers.
            (5) Platforms offered by online travel agencies provide 
        consumers with a valuable tool for comparative shopping for 
        hotels and should not be mistaken for the unlawful third-party 
        actors that commit such misappropriation.
            (6) The misleading and deceptive sales tactics companies 
        use against customers booking hotel rooms online have resulted 
        in the loss of sensitive financial and personal information, 
        financial harm, and headache for consumers.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) consumers benefit from the ability to shop for travel-
        related services and products on the innovative platforms 
        offered by online travel agencies;
            (2) sellers on the Internet should provide consumers with 
        clear, accurate information and such sellers should have an 
        opportunity to compete fairly with one another; and
            (3) the Federal Trade Commission should revise the Internet 
        Web site of the Commission to make it easier for consumers and 
        businesses to report complaints of deceptive practices with 
        respect to online booking of hotel reservations.
