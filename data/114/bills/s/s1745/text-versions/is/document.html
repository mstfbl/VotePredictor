                                 A BILL


 
   To provide grants to eligible entities to develop and maintain or 
   improve and expand before school, afterschool, and summer school 
programs for Indian and Alaska Native students, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Extracurricular Programs for Indian 
Children Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that:
            (1) The United States has a distinct legal, treaty, and 
        trust obligation to provide for the education, healthcare, 
        safety, social welfare, and other needs of Native children.
            (2) Native children are the most at-risk population in the 
        United States, confronting serious disparities in education, 
        health, and safety, with 37 percent of Native children living 
        in poverty.
            (3) Teens who do not participate in those programs are 
        nearly 3 times more likely to use marijuana or other drugs, and 
        more likely to drink alcohol. 22.9 percent of Native children 
        aged 12 and older report alcohol use, 16 percent report 
        substance dependence or abuse, 35.8 percent report tobacco use, 
        and 12.5 percent report illicit drug use.
            (4) Protective factors against youth suicide include 
        opportunities to participate in and contribute to school and/or 
        community projects/activities. Suicide is the second leading 
        cause of death of Native youth aged 15 through 24 at a rate of 
        2.5 percent--this is twice the national rate of non-Native 
        youth of the same age.
            (5) Nationally, American Indian and Alaska Native students 
        have the lowest college enrollment rates. At-risk youth who 
        have a mentor are more likely to pursue higher education after 
        high school in a four-year, two-year, or vocational program 
        than their at-risk peers who do not have a mentor. (45 percent 
        compared to 29 percent).
            (6) Students who are engaged in extracurricular 
        (afterschool and summer learning) activities have better 
        attendance records, higher levels of academic achievement, and 
        more interest in pursuing higher education after graduation.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a grant 
program for Indian tribes and eligible tribal entities for 
extracurricular programs--
            (1) to support and encourage the educational and cultural 
        growth of Indian and Alaska Native students;
            (2) to provide access to mentors and resources that promote 
        emotional and mental resilience in Native youth;
            (3) to ensure Native children receive consistent access to 
        nutritional meals; and
            (4) to increase the availability of safe and useable 
        educational infrastructures in Native communities and on tribal 
        land.
    (b) Purpose of Grants.--The funds awarded under the grant program 
established under section 366 of the Consolidated Farm and Rural 
Development Act (as added by section 4(a)) shall be used for--
            (1) culturally appropriate before school, afterschool, and 
        summer school programs that include activities designed to 
        reinforce and complement the academic program of participating 
        students, such as--
                    (A) development and extracurricular activities; and
                    (B) programs relating to--
                            (i) substance abuse and violence

                            (ii) counseling;

                            (iv) Native culture and language;
                            (v) agriculture and nutrition;
                            (vi) technology education; and
                            (vii) character education;
            (2) funds to build or upgrade facilities for before school, 
        afterschool, and summer school programs; and
            (3) access to federally funded meal programs.
