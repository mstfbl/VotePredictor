                reimbursement under the arrangement, reduced by the

                makes contributions described in subsection (b) or (d) 
                of section 106, the cost of the coverage shall be equal

SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATED TO OFFSETTING THE REVENUE LOSS FROM 
              REPEAL OF THE EXCISE TAX ON HIGH COST EMPLOYER-SPONSORED 
              HEALTH COVERAGE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the revenue loss resulting from 
the repeal of the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health 
coverage under section 4980I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
should be offset to ensure that the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act continues to reduce the deficit while improving health 
coverage for millions of Americans.
