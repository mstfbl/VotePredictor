To amend chapter 90 of title 18, United States Code, to provide Federal

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FEDERAL JURISDICTION FOR THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1836 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:
    ``(b) Private Civil Actions.--
            ``(1) In general.--An owner of a trade secret that is 
        misappropriated may bring a civil action under this subsection 
        if the trade secret is related to a product or service used in, 
        or intended for use in, interstate or foreign commerce.
            ``(2) Civil seizure.--
                    ``(A) In general.--
                            ``(i) Application.--Based on an affidavit 
                        or verified complaint satisfying the 
                        requirements of this paragraph, the court may, 
                        upon ex parte application but only in 
                        extraordinary circumstances, issue an order 
                        providing for the seizure of property necessary 
                        to prevent the propagation or dissemination of 
                        the trade secret that is the subject of the 
                        action.

                        appears from specific facts that--

under this subsection may be used in a prosecution under this chapter 
for any purpose other than those set forth in this section, or 
otherwise required by law. The provision of information relating to a 
trade secret to the United States or the court in connection with a 
prosecution under this chapter shall not constitute a waiver of trade 
secret protection, and the disclosure of information relating to a 
trade secret in connection with a prosecution under this chapter shall

        theft of trade secrets overseas.
            (5) A breakdown of the trade secret protections afforded 
        United States companies by each country that is a trading 
        partner of the United States and enforcement efforts available 
        and undertaken in each such country, including a list

                taken outside of the United States; and
                    (D) provide a mechanism for United States companies

        companies that own the trade secrets and the employees of the 
        companies;
            (3) chapter 90 of title 18, United States Code (commonly 
        known as the ``Economic Espionage Act of 1996''), applies 
        broadly to protect trade secrets from theft; and
            (4) it is important when seizing information to balance the 
        need to prevent or remedy misappropriation with the need to 
        avoid interrupting the--
                    (A) business of third parties; and
                    (B) legitimate interests of the party accused of 
                wrongdoing.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Federal Judicial Center, using existing resources, 
shall develop recommended best practices for--
            (1) the seizure of information and media storing the 
        information; and
            (2) the securing of the information and media once seized.
    (b) Updates.--The Federal Judicial Center shall update the 
recommended best practices developed under subsection (a) from time to 
time.
    (c) Congressional Submissions.--The Federal Judicial Center shall 
provide a copy of the recommendations developed under subsection (a), 
and any updates made under subsection (b), to the--
            (1) Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate; and
            (2) Committee on the Judiciary of the House of
