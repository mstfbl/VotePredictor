                                 AN ACT


 
To require the Secretary of Commerce to undertake certain activities to 
      support waterfront community revitalization and resiliency.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Waterfront Community Revitalization 
and Resiliency Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) many communities in the United States were developed 
        along waterfronts;
            (2) water proximity and access is a recognized economic 
        driver;
            (3) water shortages faced by parts of the United States 
        underscore the need to manage water sustainably and restore 
        water quality;
            (4) interest in waterfront revitalization and development 
        has grown, while the circumstances driving waterfront 
        development have changed;
            (5) waterfront communities face challenges to revitalizing 
        and leveraging water resources, such as outdated development 
        patterns, deteriorated water infrastructure, industrial 
        contamination of soil and sediment, and lack of public access 
        to the waterfront, which are often compounded by overarching 
        economic distress in the community;
            (6) public investment in waterfront community development 
        and infrastructure should reflect changing ecosystem conditions 
        and extreme weather projections to ensure strategic, resilient 
        investments;
            (7) individual communities have unique priorities, 
        concerns, and opportunities related to waterfront restoration 
        and community revitalization; and
            (8) the Secretary of Commerce has unique expertise in Great 
        Lakes and ocean coastal resiliency and economic development.
