                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of Commerce to undertake certain activities to 
      support waterfront community revitalization and resiliency.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Waterfront Community 
Revitalization and Resiliency Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) many communities in the United States were 
        developed along waterfronts;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) water proximity and access is a recognized 
        economic driver;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) water shortages faced by parts of the United 
        States underscore the need to manage water sustainably and 
        restore water quality;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) interest in waterfront revitalization and 
        development has grown, while the circumstances driving 
        waterfront development have changed;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) waterfront communities face challenges to 
        revitalizing and leveraging water resources, such as outdated 
        development patterns, deteriorated water infrastructure, 
        industrial contamination of soil and sediment, and lack of 
        public access to the waterfront, which are often compounded by 
        overarching economic distress in the community;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) public investment in waterfront community 
        development and infrastructure should reflect changing 
        ecosystem conditions and extreme weather projections to ensure 
        strategic, resilient investments;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) individual communities have unique priorities, 
        concerns, and opportunities related to waterfront restoration 
        and community revitalization; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) the Secretary of Commerce has unique expertise 
        in Great Lakes and ocean coastal resiliency and economic 
        development.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In this Act:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Resilient waterfront community.--The term

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) designated by the Secretary as a 
                resilient waterfront community on the basis of the

                waterfront community plan, with eligibility determined 
                by the Secretary after considering the requirements of

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Resilient Waterfront Community Plan.--A resilient

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) describe a vision and plan for the community 
        to develop as a vital and resilient waterfront community, 
        integrating consideration of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the economic opportunities resulting 
                from water proximity and access, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) many communities in the United States were developed 
        along waterfronts;
            (2) water proximity and access is a recognized economic 
        driver;
            (3) water shortages faced by parts of the United States 
        underscore the need to manage water sustainably and restore 
        water quality;
            (4) interest in waterfront revitalization and development 
        has grown, while the circumstances driving waterfront 
        development have changed;
            (5) waterfront communities face challenges to revitalizing 
        and leveraging water resources, such as outdated development 
        patterns, deteriorated water infrastructure, industrial 
        contamination of soil and sediment, and lack of public access 
        to the waterfront, which are often compounded by overarching 
        economic distress in the community;
            (6) public investment in waterfront community development 
        and infrastructure should reflect changing ecosystem conditions 
        and extreme weather projections to ensure strategic, resilient 
        investments;
            (7) individual communities have unique priorities, 
        concerns, and opportunities related to waterfront restoration 
        and community revitalization; and
            (8) the Secretary of Commerce has unique expertise in Great 
        Lakes and ocean coastal resiliency and economic development.
