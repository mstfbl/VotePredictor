                      TITLE IV--FOOD DATE LABELING

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Food Date Labeling Act of 2016''.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) As of the date of enactment of this Act, date labeling 
        practices on food packaging cause confusion with ``sell-by'', 
        ``best-by'', ``use-by'', and ``best before'' dates, leading up 
        to 90 percent of individuals in the United States to 
        occasionally throw out still-fresh food.
            (2) Confusion over the meaning of date labels is estimated 
        to account for 20 percent of consumer waste of safe, edible 
        food, leading to approximately $29,000,000,000 of wasted 
        consumer spending each year.
            (3) Consumer education and standardized date labeling are 
        the top 2 most cost-effective strategies for reducing food 
        waste, by economic value per ton diverted.
            (4) Wasted food costs consumers and industry money, 
        squanders important natural resources that are used to grow, 
        process, distribute, and store the food supply of the United 
        States, and represents a missed opportunity to feed the 
        millions of food insecure households in the United States that 
        are struggling to access healthy, affordable food.

SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS.

    In this title:
            (1) Administering secretaries.--The term ``administering

                        and may receive additional preparation for 
                        palatability or aesthetic, epicurean,

                Health and Human Services--
                            (i) a food that is normally eaten in its

                            (ii) any other food, including a processed 
                        food, for which it is reasonably foreseeable 
                        that the food will be eaten without further 
                        processing that would significantly minimize 
                        biological hazards.
            (5) Safety date.--The term ``safety date'' means a date 
        printed on food packaging of a ready-to-eat product, which

    (a) Quality Dates.--
            (1) In general.--If a food labeler includes a quality date 
        on food packaging, the label shall use the uniform quality date 
        label phrase under paragraph (2).
            (2) Uniform phrase.--The uniform quality date label phrase 
        under this paragraph shall be ``best if used by'', unless and 
        until the administering Secretaries, acting jointly, specify 
        through rulemaking another uniform phrase to be used for 
        purposes of complying with paragraph (1).
            (3) Option of the labeler.--The decision to include a 
        quality date on food packaging shall be at the discretion of 
        the food labeler.
    (b) Safety Dates.--
            (1) In general.--The label of a ready-to-eat product shall 
        include a safety date that is immediately preceded by the 
        uniform safety date label phrase under paragraph (2) if the 
        ready-to-eat product--
                    (A) meets the criteria described in paragraph 
                (3)(A) and is not exempt under paragraph (3)(B)(ii); or

                    (A) In general.--The administering Secretaries, 
                acting jointly, shall describe criteria that determine 
                what ready-to-eat products may have a high level of 
                risk associated with consumption after a certain date, 
                including those that may be high or very high risk for 
                Listeria monocytogenes or other contaminants or 
                pathogens causing foodborne illness.
                    (B) Additional foods; exempt foods.--The 
                administering Secretaries may, with respect to the

                            (i) list additional ready-to-eat products 
                        that are high risk, but do not meet the 
                        criteria described in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) exempt specific ready-to-eat products 
                        that meet the criteria described in

                        high level of risk associated with consumption 
                        after a certain date.
                    (C) Review and updates.--Not less frequently than 
                once every 4 years, the administering Secretaries,

            (1) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to prohibit any State or political subdivision of a 
        State from establishing or continuing in effect any requirement 
        that prohibits the sale or donation of foods based on passage 
        of the safety date.
            (2) Preemption.--No State or political subdivision of a 
        State may establish or continue in effect any requirement 
        that--
                    (A) relates to the inclusion in food labeling of a 
                quality date or a safety date that is different from or 
                in addition to, or that is otherwise not identical 
                with, the requirements under this section; or
