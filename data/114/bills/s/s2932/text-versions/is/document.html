                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 16, 2016

  referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the provision of 
                      emergency medical services.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Patient Access to 
Emergency Medications Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the use of controlled substances by emergency medical 
        services agencies to administer medical care and medicines to 
        individuals in the field is essential to save lives, manage 
        pain, and improve health outcomes;
            (2) the unique nature of mobile emergency medical services 
        is unlike other healthcare services governed by the Controlled 
        Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) in that it requires the 
        provision of time-sensitive and mobile medical care to 
        individuals with critical injuries and illnesses in the field 
        and movement of such individuals to definitive care;
            (3) there have been few investigations by the Drug 
        Enforcement Administration related to diversion in emergency 
        medical services;
            (4) one recent survey of large emergency medical services 
        agencies in the United States showed less than 20 diversions or 
        investigations for nearly 70,000 doses of controlled substances 
        administered;
            (5) regulatory oversight to prevent diversion is essential 
        in all health care settings, including emergency medical 
        services;
            (6) such oversight shall be carefully tailored to recognize 
        unique care delivery models, including the provision of medical 
        care to individuals by emergency medical services practitioners 
        under the supervision of a physician medical director; and
            (7) such oversight should further promote uniformity of 
        rules, application and enforcement to prevent diversion and 
        establish clear guidelines within emergency medical services 
        while also recognizing the variety of emergency medical 
        services agencies including governmental, nongovernmental, 
        private, and volunteer emergency medical services agencies.

SEC. 3. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.

    Part C of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 821 et seq.) is
