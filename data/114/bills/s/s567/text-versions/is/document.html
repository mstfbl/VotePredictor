   To protect the right of law-abiding citizens to transport knives

        carrier misrouting or delays, stops for food, fuel, vehicle 
        maintenance, emergencies, medical treatment, and any other 
        activity related to the journey of an individual; and
            (2) does not include transport of a knife with the intent 
        to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term 
        exceeding 1 year involving the use or threatened use of force 
        against another person, or with knowledge, or reasonable cause 
        to believe, that such an offense is to be committed in the 
        course of, or arising from, the journey.
    (b) Transport of Knives.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, rule, or regulation of the United States, or of a State or 
political subdivision of a State, an individual who is not otherwise 
prohibited by Federal law from possessing, transporting, shipping, or 
receiving a knife may transport a knife from any State or place where 
the individual may lawfully possess, carry, or transport the knife to 
any other State or place where the individual may lawfully possess, 
carry, or transport the knife if--
            (1) in the case of transport by motor vehicle--
                    (A) the knife is not directly accessible from the 
                passenger compartment of the motor vehicle; or
                    (B) in the case of a motor vehicle without a 
                compartment separate from the passenger compartment, 
                the knife is contained in a closed--
                            (i) container;
                            (ii) glove compartment; or

            (2) in the case of transport by means other than a motor 
        vehicle, including any transport over land, on or through

                escape in an emergency that incorporates a blunt tipped 
                safety blade or a guarded blade or both for cutting 
                safety belts; and
                    (B) shall not be required to secure a knife or tool

                            (ii) glove compartment; or
                            (iii) console.
            (2) Limitation.--This subsection shall not apply to the 
        transport of a knife or tool in the passenger cabin of an

        procedures of the Transportation Security Administration.
    (d) No Arrest or Detention.--An individual who is transporting a 
knife in compliance with this section may not be arrested or otherwise 
detained for violation of any law, rule, or regulation of a State or 
political subdivision of a State related to the possession, transport, 
or carrying of a knife, unless there is probable cause to believe that 
the individual is not in compliance with subsection (b).
    (e) Claim or Defense.--An individual may assert this section as a 
claim or defense in any civil or criminal action or proceeding. When an

compliance with subsection (b).
    (f) Right of Action.--
            (1) In general.--Any individual who, under color of any 
        statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State 
        or political subdivision of a State, subjects, or causes to be 
        subjected, any individual to the deprivation of the rights, 
        privileges, or immunities provided for in this section, shall
