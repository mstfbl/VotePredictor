                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure that significantly more students graduate college with the 
international knowledge and experience essential for success in today's 
  global economy through the establishment of the Senator Paul Simon 
          Study Abroad Program in the Department of Education.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad 
Program Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global 
        economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as 
        part of a well-rounded education.
            (2) Study abroad programs provide students with 
        unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched 
        opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique 
        environment for developing cultural understanding, all of which 
        are knowledge and skills needed in today's global economy.
            (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary 
        students in the United States study abroad for credit in any 
        given year, and minority students, first generation college 
        students, and community college students are significantly 
        underrepresented in study abroad participation.
            (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission 
        on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant 
        to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets 
        Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). Pursuant to its 
        mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to Congress and the 
        President a report of its recommendations for greatly expanding 
        the opportunity for students at institutions of higher 
        education in the United States to study abroad, with special 
        emphasis on studying in developing nations.
            (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience 
        shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will 
        drive the number of study abroad participants higher and 
        improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only 
        way that study abroad will become an integral part of the 
        undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is 
        necessary to encourage and support such leadership.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access 
        to quality study abroad opportunities;
            (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying 
        abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of 
        higher education in the United States;
            (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad 
        destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that 
        takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations, 
        especially in developing countries; and
            (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of 
        higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.
