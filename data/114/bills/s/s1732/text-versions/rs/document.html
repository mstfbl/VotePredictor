&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the followings findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Federal transportation research planning and 
        coordination--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) should occur within the Office of the 
                Secretary; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) should be, to the extent practicable, 
                multimodal and not occur solely within the subagencies 
                of the Department of Transportation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Managing a multi-modal research portfolio 
        within the Office of the Secretary will--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) improve the overall research products 
                of the Department.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Increasing transparency of transportation 
        research efforts will--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) build stakeholder confidence in the 
                final product; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) America's ports play a critical role in the 
        Nation's transportation supply chain network.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods 
        through the Nation's ports ensures that American goods are 
        available to customers throughout the world.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain 
        network, particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in 
        tremendous economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and 
        retailers that rely on timely shipments.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) A clear understanding of port productivity and 
        throughput would help--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) to identify freight 
                bottlenecks;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to indicate performance and trends 
                over time; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) to inform investment 
                decisions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2001. CORRELATION STUDY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration (referred to in this part as the 
``Administrator'') shall commission the National Research Council of 
the National Academies to conduct a study of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Safety Measurement System (referred to in 
        this part as ``SMS''); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) shall analyze--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the accuracy with which the Behavior 
                Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (referred to

                        carriers; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) predict or be correlated with 
                        future crash risk, crash severity, or other 
                        safety indicators for individual drivers, motor 
                        carriers, and the highest risk 
                        carriers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the methodology used to calculate 
                BASIC percentiles and identify carriers for 
                enforcement, including the weights assigned to 
                particular violations, and the tie between crash risk 
                and specific regulatory violations, in order to 
                accurately identify and predict future crash risk for 
                motor carriers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the relative value of inspection 
                information and roadside enforcement data;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) any data collection gaps or data 
                sufficiency problems that may exist and the impact of 
                those data gaps and insufficiencies on the efficacy of 
                the CSA program; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) the accuracy of data processing; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) should consider--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) whether the current SMS provides 
                comparable precision and confidence for SMS alerts and 
                percentiles for the relative crash risk of individual 
                large and small motor carriers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) whether alternative systems would 
                identify high risk carriers or identify high risk 
                drivers and motor carriers more accurately; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the recommendations and findings of

        commerce.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Interstate compacts.--The Secretary shall 
        allow States, including the District of Columbia, to enter into 
        an interstate compact with contiguous States to allow a 
        licensed driver between the ages of 18 and 21 to operate a 
        motor vehicle across the applicable State lines. The Secretary 
        shall approve as many as 6 interstate compacts, with no limit 
        on the number of States participating in each interstate 
        compact.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        participating in that interstate compact.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Standards.--In developing an interstate 
        compact under this subsection, participating States shall 
        provide for minimum licensure standards acceptable for 
        interstate travel under this section, which may include, for a 
        licensed driver between the ages of 18 and 21 participating in 
        the pilot program--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) age restrictions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) distance from origin (measured in air 
                miles);&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) additional hours of service 
                restrictions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Limitations.--An interstate compact under 
        paragraph (2) may not permit special configuration or hazardous 
        cargo operations to be transported by a licensed driver under 
        the age of 21.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Additional requirements.--The Secretary may--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) prescribe such additional 
                requirements, including training, for a licensed driver 
                between the ages of 18 and 21 participating in the 
                pilot program as the Secretary considers necessary; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) provide risk mitigation restrictions 
                and limitations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Approval.--An interstate compact under subsection 
(a)(2) may not go into effect until it has been approved by the 
governor of each State (or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, if 
applicable) that is a party to the interstate compact, after 
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator 
of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Report.--Not earlier than 4 years after the date the 
test program is established, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 
report containing the findings of the pilot program, a determination of 
whether a licensed driver between the ages of 18 and 21 can operate a 
commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce with an equivalent 
level of safety, and the reasons for that determination.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Interim formula.--Prior to the development of 
        the new allocation formula, the Secretary may calculate the 
        interim funding amounts for the motor carrier safety assistance 
        program in fiscal year 2017 (and later fiscal years, as 
        necessary) under section 31104(a)(1) of title 49, United States 
        Code, as amended by section 2602 of this Act, by the following 
        methodology:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) The Secretary shall calculate the 
                funding amount using the allocation formula the 
                Secretary used to award motor carrier safety assistance 
                program funding in fiscal year 2016 under section 2607 
                of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) The Secretary shall average the 
                funding awarded or other equitable amounts to a State 
                in fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for border 
                enforcement grants awarded under section 32603(c) of 
                MAP-21 (126 Stat. 807; Public Law 112-141) and new 
                entrant audit grants awarded under that section, or 
                other equitable amounts.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) The Secretary shall add the amounts 
                calculated in subparagraphs (A) and (B).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Adjustments.--Subject to the availability of 
        funding and notwithstanding fluctuations in the data elements 
        used by the Secretary, the initial amounts resulting from the 
        calculation described in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted to 
        ensure that, for each State, the amount shall not be less than 
        97 percent of the average amount of funding received or other 
        equitable amounts in fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) motor carrier safety assistance 
                program funds awarded under section 32603(a) of MAP-21 
                (126 Stat. 807; Public Law 112-141);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) border enforcement grants awarded 
                under section 32603(a) of MAP-21 (126 Stat. 807; Public 
                Law 112-141); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                section 32603(a) of MAP-21 (126 Stat. 807; Public Law 
                112-141).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Immediate relief.--In developing the new 
        allocation formula, the Secretary shall provide immediate 
        relief for at least 3 fiscal years to all States currently 
        subject to the withholding provisions of Motor Carrier Safety 
        Assistance Program funds for matters of 
        noncompliance.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Future withholdings.--Beginning on the date 
        that the new allocation formula is implemented, the Secretary 
        shall impose all future withholdings in accordance with section

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2609. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT CALCULATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula 
        has not been established for fiscal year 2017, then, for fiscal 
        year 2017, the Secretary of Transportation shall calculate the 
        maintenance of effort required under section 31102(f) of title 
        49, United States Code, as amended by section 2602 of this Act, 
        by averaging the expenditures for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 
        required by section 32601(a)(5) of MAP-21 (Public Law 112-141), 
        as that section was in effect on the day before the date of 
        enactment of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may 
        use the methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort 
        for fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter if a new 
        allocation formula has not been established.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and 
        (3)(B), beginning on the date that a new allocation formula is 
        established under section 2608, upon the request of a State, 
        the Secretary may modify the baseline maintenance of effort 
        required by section 31102(e) of title 49, United States Code, 
        as amended by section 2602 of this Act, for the purpose of 
        establishing a new baseline maintenance of effort if the 
        Secretary determines that a waiver or modification--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) is equitable due to reasonable 
                circumstances;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) will ensure the continuation of 
                commercial motor vehicle enforcement activities in the 
                State; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) is necessary to ensure that the total 
                amount of State maintenance of effort and matching 
                expenditures required under sections 31102 and 31104 of 
                title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 
                2602 of this Act, does not exceed a sum greater than 
                the total amount of State maintenance of effort and 
                matching expenditures for the 3 fiscal years prior to 
                the date of enactment of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a 
        State, the Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort 
        baseline according to the following methodology:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) The Secretary shall establish the 
                maintenance of effort using the average of fiscal years 
                2004 and 2005, as required by section 32601(a)(5) of 
                MAP-21 (Public Law 112-141).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the 
                average required match by a lead State commercial motor 
                vehicle safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 
                2015 for motor carrier safety assistance grants 
                established at 20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, 
                United States Code, as that section was in effect on 
                the day before the date of enactment of this 
                Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) The Secretary shall calculate the 
                estimated match required under section 31104(b) of 
                title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 
                2602 of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) The Secretary will subtract the amount 
                in subparagraph (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) 
                and--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) if the number is greater than 
                        0, then the Secretary shall subtract the number 
                        from the amount in subparagraph (A); 
                        or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) if the number is not greater 
                        than 0, then the Secretary shall calculate the 
                        maintenance of effort using the methodology in 
                        subparagraph (A).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Maintenance of effort amount.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall use 
                the amount calculated in paragraph (2) as the baseline 
                maintenance of effort required in section 31102(f) of 
                title 49, United States Code, as amended by section 
                2602 of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request 
                a waiver or modification under this subsection before 
                September 30 during the first fiscal year that the 
                Secretary implements the new allocation formula under 
                section 2608, the Secretary shall calculate the 
                maintenance of effort using the methodology in 
                paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The 
        maintenance of effort calculated under this section is the 
        amount required under section 31102(f) of title 49, United 
        States Code, as amended by section 2602 of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Termination of Effectiveness.--The authority under 
this section terminates effective on the date that the new maintenance 
of effort is calculated based on the new allocation formula implemented 
under section 2608.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Data.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the Surface 
Transportation Board, Amtrak, freight railroads, State and local 
governments, and regional business, tourism and economic development 
agencies shall conduct a data needs assessment--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to support the development of an efficient and 
        effective intercity passenger rail network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to identify the data needed to conduct cost-
        effective modeling and analysis for intercity passenger rail 
        development programs;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) to determine limitations to the data used for 
        inputs;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) to develop a strategy to address such 
        limitations;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) to identify barriers to accessing existing 
        data;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) to develop recommendations regarding whether 
        the authorization of additional data collection for intercity 
        passenger rail travel is warranted; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) to determine which entities will be

        developing benefit and cost information for rail 
        projects;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by providing more direct and consistent 
        requirements for assessing benefits and costs across 
        transportation funding programs, including the appropriate use 
        of discount rates;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) by requiring applicants to clearly communicate 
        the methodology used to calculate the project benefits and 
        costs, including non-proprietary information on--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) assumptions underlying

        for damages involving personal injury, wrongful death, or 
        property damage against a railroad carrier or railroad carrier 
        contractor) any plan, document, report, survey, schedule, list, 
        or data compiled or collected for the sole purpose of 
        developing, evaluating, planning, or implementing a 
        confidential close call reporting system program, including a 
        railroad carrier's analysis of its close calls or near 
        misses.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Retroactive applications.--With regard to a 
        voluntary confidential close call reporting system that was in 
        effect prior to the date of final rule under subsection (a), 
        the Secretary--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) shall allow the parties participating 
                in that system to sign a new or revised implementing 
                memorandum of understanding that prospectively entitles 
                the parties to the information protections under 
                paragraph (1); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) may retroactively apply the 
                information protections under paragraph (1) to any 
                information and analyses that was generated under that 
                system prior to the date of the final rule.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        call reporting system program established through an 
        implementing memorandum of understanding described in 
        subsection (c), the Secretary shall ensure that the Department 
        of Transportation and any entity collecting close call reports, 
        de-identifying data, or distributing close call data provide 
        the same level of confidentiality as contained in the 
        Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency 
        Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 note), as administered by the 
        Bureau of Transportation Statistics.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) require a railroad carrier to adopt a 
        confidential close call reporting system program;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) prohibit a railroad carrier from voluntarily 
        adopting a confidential close call reporting system program 
        outside of the rulemaking framework; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

United States Code, is certified by the Secretary under subsection (h) 
of such section and implemented on all of that railroad carrier's or 
other entity's lines required to have operations governed by a positive 
train control system, any railroad carrier or other entity that has 
been certified by the Secretary under such subsection shall not be 
subject to the operational restrictions set forth in subpart I of part

apply in the event of a positive train control system component 
failure.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Interoperability Procedure.--If multiple railroad 
carriers operate on a single railroad line through a trackage or 
haulage agreement, each railroad carrier operating on the railroad line 
shall not be subject to the operating restrictions set forth in subpart 
I of part 236 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to 
the railroad line, until the Secretary certifies that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        providing regularly scheduled intercity or commuter rail 
        passenger transportation that operates on the railroad line is 
        in compliance with its positive train control requirements 
        under section 20157(a) of title 49, United States 
        Code;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        operates on the railroad line is in compliance with the 
        applicable regulatory requirements to equip locomotives 
        operating in positive train control territory; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the implementation of any and all positive 
        train control systems are interoperable and operational on the 
        railroad line in conformance with each approved implementation 
        plan so that each freight and passenger railroad can operate on 
        the line with that freight or passenger railroad's positive 
        train control equipment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Small Railroads.--Not later than 120 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall amend section 
236.1006(b)(4)(iii)(B) of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations

I railroad carrier and each entity providing regularly scheduled 
intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation is in compliance 
with the positive train control requirements under section 20157(a) of 
title 49, United States Code, the Secretary shall enter into an 
agreement with the National Cooperative Rail Research Program Board--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to conduct a study of the possible 
        effectiveness of positive train control and related 
        technologies on reducing collisions at highway-rail grade 
        crossings; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to submit a report containing the results of 
        the study conducted under paragraph (1) to the Committee on 
        Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the

identifying additional actions to facilitate high quality, efficient, 
and targeted environmental reviews and permitting decisions. The 
sessions and the interagency collaborations they generate shall focus 
on how to work with State and local transportation entities to improve 
project planning, siting, and application quality and how to consult 
and coordinate with relevant stakeholders and Federal, tribal, State, 
and local representatives early in permitting processes.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) America's ports play a critical role in the Nation's 
        transportation supply chain network.
            (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods through the 
        Nation's ports ensures that American goods are available to 
        customers throughout the world.
            (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain network, 
        particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in tremendous 
        economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and retailers that 
        rely on timely shipments.

                    (B) consider effects on commercial truck and bus 
                carriers of various sizes and types.
    (b) Public Participation.--
            (1) In general.--Before promulgating a proposed rule under 
        subtitle VI of title 49, United States Code, if the proposed 
        rule is likely to lead to the promulgation of a major rule the

SEC. 2401. EMERGENCY ROUTE WORKING GROUP.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Establishment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a working 
        group to determine best practices for expeditious State 
        approval of special permits for vehicles involved in emergency 
        response and recovery.
            (2) Members.--The working group shall include 
        representatives from--
                    (A) State highway transportation departments or

    (b) Considerations.--In determining best practices under subsection 
(a), the working group shall consider whether--
            (1) hurdles currently exist that prevent the expeditious 
        State approval for special permits for vehicles involved in 
        emergency response and recovery;
            (2) it is possible to pre-identify and establish emergency 
        routes between States through which infrastructure repair 
        materials could be delivered following a natural disaster or an 
        emergency;
            (3) a State could pre-designate an emergency route 
        identified under paragraph (1) as a certified emergency route 
        if a motor vehicle that exceeds the otherwise applicable 
        Federal and State truck length or width limits may safely 
        operate along such route during period of emergency recovery; 
        and
            (4) an online map could be created to identify each pre-
        designated emergency route under paragraph (2), including 
        information on specific limitations, obligations, and 
        notification requirements along that route.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the working group shall submit to the Secretary a report of 
its findings under this section and any recommendations for the 
implementation of the best practices for expeditious State approval of 
special permits for vehicles involved in emergency recovery. Upon

        operate a commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce.
            (2) Interstate compacts.--The Secretary shall allow States, 
        including the District of Columbia, to enter into an interstate 
        compact with contiguous States to allow a licensed driver 
        between the ages of 18 and 21 to operate a motor vehicle across 
        the applicable State lines. The Secretary shall approve as many 
        as 6 interstate compacts, with no limit on the number of States 
        participating in each interstate compact.
            (3) Mutual recognition of licenses.--A valid intrastate 
        commercial driver's licenses issued by a State participating in 
        an interstate compact under paragraph (2) shall be recognized 
        as valid in each State that is participating in that interstate 
        compact.
            (4) Standards.--In developing an interstate compact under 
        this subsection, participating States shall provide for minimum 
        licensure standards acceptable for interstate travel under this 
        section, which may include, for a licensed driver between the 
        ages of 18 and 21 participating in the pilot program--
                    (A) age restrictions;
                    (B) distance from origin (measured in air miles);
                    (C) reporting requirements; or
                    (D) additional hours of service restrictions.
            (5) Limitations.--An interstate compact under paragraph (2) 
        may not permit special configuration or hazardous cargo 
        operations to be transported by a licensed driver under the age 
        of 21.
            (6) Additional requirements.--The Secretary may--
                    (A) prescribe such additional requirements, 
                including training, for a licensed driver between the 
                ages of 18 and 21 participating in the pilot program as 
                the Secretary considers necessary; and
                    (B) provide risk mitigation restrictions and 
                limitations.
    (b) Approval.--An interstate compact under subsection (a)(2) may 
not go into effect until it has been approved by the governor of each 
State (or the Mayor of the District of Columbia, if applicable) that is 
a party to the interstate compact, after consultation with the 
Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Administration.
    (c) Report.--Not earlier than 4 years after the date the test 
program is established, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report 
containing the findings of the pilot program, a determination of 
whether a licensed driver between the ages of 18 and 21 can operate a 
commercial motor vehicle in interstate commerce with an equivalent 
level of safety, and the reasons for that determination.

SEC. 2509. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT CALCULATION.

    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--
            (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula has not 
        been established for fiscal year 2017, then, for fiscal year 
        2017, the Secretary of Transportation shall calculate the 
        maintenance of effort required under section 31102(f) of title 
        49, United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this Act, 
        by averaging the expenditures for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 
        required by section 32601(a)(5) of MAP-21 (Public Law 112--
        141), as that section was in effect on the day before the date 
        of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may use the 
        methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort for 
        fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter if a new 
        allocation formula has not been established.
    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)(B), 
        beginning on the date that a new allocation formula is 
        established under section 2508, upon the request of a State, 
        the Secretary may modify the baseline maintenance of effort 
        required by section 31102(e) of title 49, United States Code, 
        as amended by section 2502 of this Act, for the purpose of 
        establishing a new baseline maintenance of effort if the 
        Secretary determines that a waiver or modification--
                    (A) is equitable due to reasonable circumstances;
                    (B) will ensure the continuation of commercial 
                motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State; and
                    (C) is necessary to ensure that the total amount of 
                State maintenance of effort and matching expenditures 
                required under sections 31102 and 31104 of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act, does not exceed a sum greater than the average of 
                the total amount of State maintenance of effort and 
                matching expenditures for the 3 fiscal years prior to 
                the date of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a State, the 
        Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort baseline 
        according to the following methodology:
                    (A) The Secretary shall establish the maintenance 
                of effort using the average of fiscal years 2004 and 
                2005, as required by section 32601(a)(5) of MAP-21 
                (Public Law 112--141).
                    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average 
                required match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle 
                safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for 
                motor carrier safety assistance grants established at 
                20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, United States

                the date of enactment of this Act.
                    (C) The Secretary shall calculate the estimated 
                match required under section 31104(b) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act.
                    (D) The Secretary will subtract the amount in 
                subparagraph (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) 
                and--
                            (i) if the number is greater than 0, then 
                        the Secretary shall subtract the number from 
                        the amount in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, 
                        then the Secretary shall calculate the 
                        maintenance of effort using the methodology in 
                        subparagraph (A).

                of effort required in section 31102(f) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act.
                    (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request a waiver 
                or modification under this subsection before September 
                30 during the first fiscal year that the Secretary 
                implements the new allocation formula under section 
                2508, the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance of 
                effort using the methodology in paragraph (2)(A) of 
                this subsection.
            (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of 
        effort calculated under this section is the amount required 
        under section 31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as 
        amended by section 2502 of this Act.

of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with Amtrak, commuter rail 
authorities, and other passenger rail operators, railroad carriers that 
own rail infrastructure over which both passenger and freight trains 
operate, States, the Surface Transportation Board, the Northeast 
Corridor Commission established under section 24905, the State-
Supported Route Committee established under section 24712, and groups 
representing rail passengers and customers, as appropriate, shall 
complete a study that evaluates--
            (1) the shared use of right-of-way by passenger and freight 
        rail systems; and
            (2) the operational, institutional, and legal structures 
        that would best support improvements to the systems referred to 
        in paragraph (1).
    (b) Areas of Study.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall evaluate--
            (1) the access and use of railroad right-of-way by a rail 
        carrier that does not own the right-of-way, such as passenger 
        rail services that operate over privately-owned right-of-way, 
        including an analysis of--
                    (A) access agreements;
                    (B) costs of access; and

        and regulatory mechanisms for establishing, measuring, and 
        enforcing train performance standards, including--
                    (A) the manner in which passenger train delays are 
                recorded;
                    (B) the assignment of responsibility for such 
                delays; and
                    (C) the use of incentives and penalties for 
                performance;
            (3) strengths and weaknesses in the existing mechanisms 
        described in paragraph (2) and possible approaches to address 
        the weaknesses;
            (4) mechanisms for measuring and maintaining public 
        benefits resulting from publicly funded freight or passenger 
        rail improvements, including improvements directed towards 
        shared-use right-of-way by passenger and freight rail;
            (5) approaches to operations, capacity, and cost estimation 
        modeling that--
                    (A) allows for transparent decisionmaking; and
                    (B) protects the proprietary interests of all 
                parties;
            (6) liability requirements and arrangements, including--

                    (C) whether current insurance levels of passenger 
                rail operators are adequate and whether to establish 
                minimum insurance requirements for such passenger rail 
                operators; and
                    (D) whether to establish a liability regime modeled 
                after section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
                U.S.C. 2210);
            (7) the effect on rail passenger services, operations, 
        liability limits and insurance levels of the assertion of 
        sovereign immunity by a State; and
            (8) other issues identified by the Secretary.
