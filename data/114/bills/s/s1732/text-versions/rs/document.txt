SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) America's ports play a critical role in the Nation's 
        transportation supply chain network.
            (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods through the 
        Nation's ports ensures that American goods are available to 
        customers throughout the world.
            (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain network, 
        particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in tremendous 
        economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and retailers that 
        rely on timely shipments.
            (4) A clear understanding of port productivity and 
        throughput would help--
                    (A) to identify freight bottlenecks;
                    (B) to indicate performance and trends over time;

    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--
            (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula has not 
        been established for fiscal year 2017, then, for fiscal year 
        2017, the Secretary of Transportation shall calculate the 
        maintenance of effort required under section 31102(f) of title 
        49, United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this Act,

        required by section 32601(a)(5) of MAP-21 (Public Law 112--
        141), as that section was in effect on the day before the date 
        of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may use the 
        methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort for 
        fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter if a new 
        allocation formula has not been established.
    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)(B), 
        beginning on the date that a new allocation formula is

        the Secretary may modify the baseline maintenance of effort 
        required by section 31102(e) of title 49, United States Code, 
        as amended by section 2502 of this Act, for the purpose of 
        establishing a new baseline maintenance of effort if the 
        Secretary determines that a waiver or modification--
                    (A) is equitable due to reasonable circumstances;
                    (B) will ensure the continuation of commercial 
                motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State; and
                    (C) is necessary to ensure that the total amount of 
                State maintenance of effort and matching expenditures 
                required under sections 31102 and 31104 of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act, does not exceed a sum greater than the average of 
                the total amount of State maintenance of effort and 
                matching expenditures for the 3 fiscal years prior to 
                the date of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a State, the 
        Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort baseline 
        according to the following methodology:
                    (A) The Secretary shall establish the maintenance 
                of effort using the average of fiscal years 2004 and 
                2005, as required by section 32601(a)(5) of MAP-21 
                (Public Law 112--141).
                    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average 
                required match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle 
                safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for 
                motor carrier safety assistance grants established at 
                20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, United States 
                Code, as that section was in effect on the day before 
                the date of enactment of this Act.
                    (C) The Secretary shall calculate the estimated 
                match required under section 31104(b) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act.

                subparagraph (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) 
                and--
                            (i) if the number is greater than 0, then 
                        the Secretary shall subtract the number from 
                        the amount in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, 
                        then the Secretary shall calculate the 
                        maintenance of effort using the methodology in 
                        subparagraph (A).

                United States Code, as amended by section 2502 of this 
                Act.
                    (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request a waiver 
                or modification under this subsection before September 
                30 during the first fiscal year that the Secretary 
                implements the new allocation formula under section 
                2508, the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance of 
                effort using the methodology in paragraph (2)(A) of 
                this subsection.
            (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of 
        effort calculated under this section is the amount required
