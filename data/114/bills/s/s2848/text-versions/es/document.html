     TITLE VII--SAFE DRINKING WATER AND CLEAN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

SEC. 7001. DEFINITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.

    In this title, the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency.

SEC. 7002. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON APPROPRIATIONS LEVELS AND FINDINGS ON 
              ECONOMIC IMPACTS.

    (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
Congress should provide robust funding for the State drinking water 
treatment revolving loan funds established under section 1452 of the 
Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12) and the State water 
pollution control revolving funds established under title VI of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.).
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds, based on an analysis sponsored by 
the Water Environment Federation and the WateReuse Association of the 
nationwide impact of State revolving loan fund spending using the 
IMPLAN economic model developed by the Federal Government, that, in 
addition to the public health and environmental benefits, the Federal 
investment in safe drinking water and clean water provides the 
following benefits:
            (1) Generation of significant Federal tax revenue, as 
        evidenced by the following:
                    (A) Every dollar of a Federal capitalization grant 
                returns $0.21 to the general fund of the Treasury in 
                the form of Federal taxes and, when additional spending 
                from the State revolving loan funds is considered to be 
                the result of leveraging the Federal investment, every 
                dollar of a Federal capitalization grant returns $0.93 
                in Federal tax revenue.
                    (B) A combined $34,700,000,000 in capitalization 
                grants for the clean water and state drinking water 
                state revolving loan funds described in subsection (a) 
                over a period of 5 years would generate $7,430,000,000 
                in Federal tax revenue and, when additional spending 
                from the State revolving loan funds is considered to be 
                the result of leveraging the Federal investment, the 
                Federal investment will result in $32,300,000,000 in 
                Federal tax revenue during that 5-year period.
            (2) An increase in employment, as evidenced by the 
        following:
                    (A) Every $1,000,000 in State revolving loan fund 
                spending generates 16\1/2\ jobs.
                    (B) $34,700,000,000 in Federal capitalization 
                grants for State revolving loan funds over a period of 
                5 years would result in 506,000 jobs.
            (3) An increase in economic output:
                    (A) Every $1,000,000 in State revolving loan fund 
                spending results in $2,950,000 in output for the 
                economy of the United States.
                    (B) $34,700,000,000 in Federal capitalization 
                grants for State revolving loan funds over a period of 
                5 years will generate $102,700,000,000 in total 
                economic output.

                    ``(C) Sale of bonds.--Funds may also be used by a 
                public water system as a source of revenue (restricted

                loan fund) or security for payment of the principal and 
                interest on revenue or general obligation bonds issued 
                by the State to provide matching funds under subsection

SEC. 7113. WATER SUPPLY COST SAVINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States is facing a drinking water 
        infrastructure funding crisis;
            (2) the Environmental Protection Agency projects a 
        shortfall of approximately $384,000,000,000 in funding for 
        drinking water infrastructure from 2015 to 2035 and this 
        funding challenge is particularly acute in rural communities in 
        the United States;
            (3) there are approximately 52,000 community water systems 
        in the United States, of which nearly 42,000 are small 
        community water systems;
            (4) the Drinking Water Needs Survey conducted by the 
        Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 placed the shortfall in 
        drinking water infrastructure funding for small communities, 
        which consist of 3,300 or fewer persons, at $64,500,000,000;
            (5) small communities often cannot finance the construction 
        and maintenance of drinking water systems because the cost per 
        resident for the investment would be prohibitively expensive;
            (6) drought conditions have placed significant strains on 
        existing surface water supplies;
            (7) many communities across the United States are 
        considering the use of groundwater and community well systems 
        to provide drinking water; and
            (8) approximately 42,000,000 people in the United States 
        receive drinking water from individual wells and millions more 
        rely on community well systems for drinking water.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
providing rural communities with the knowledge and resources necessary 
to fully use alternative drinking water systems, including wells and 
community well systems, can provide safe and affordable drinking water 
to millions of people in the United States.
    (c) Drinking Water Technology Clearinghouse.--The Administrator and 
the Secretary of Agriculture shall--
            (1) update existing programs of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture designed to 
        provide drinking water technical assistance to include 
        information on cost-effective, innovative, and alternative 
        drinking water delivery systems, including systems that are 
        supported by wells; and
            (2) disseminate information on the cost effectiveness of 
        alternative drinking water delivery systems, including wells 
        and well systems, to communities and not-for-profit 
        organizations seeking Federal funding for drinking water 
        systems serving 500 or fewer persons.
    (d) Water System Assessment.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, in any application for a grant or loan from the Federal 
Government or a State that is using Federal assistance for a drinking 
water system serving 500 or fewer persons, a unit of local government 
or not-for-profit organization shall self-certify that the unit of 
local government or organization has considered, as an alternative 
drinking water supply, drinking water delivery systems sourced by 
publicly owned--
            (1) individual wells;
            (2) shared wells; and
            (3) community wells.
    (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary of 
Agriculture shall submit to Congress a report that describes--
            (1) the use of innovative and alternative drinking water 
        systems described in this section;
            (2) the range of cost savings for communities using 
        innovative and alternative drinking water systems described in 
        this section; and
            (3) the use of drinking water technical assistance programs 
        operated by the Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture.

        ``Tribes and Alaska Native villages'' and inserting ``tribes, 
        Alaska Native villages, and, for the purpose of carrying out 
        paragraph (5), intertribal consortia or tribal organizations''; 
        and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Training and operator certification.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Administrator may use funds 
                made available under this subsection and section 
                1442(e)(7) to make grants to intertribal consortia or

                        most beneficial and effective.''.

SEC. 7117. REQUIREMENT FOR THE USE OF AMERICAN MATERIALS.

    Section 1452(a) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-
12(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Requirement for the use of american materials.--
                    ``(A) Definition of iron and steel products.--In

               PART IV--DELAWARE RIVER BASIN CONSERVATION

SEC. 7641. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Delaware River Basin is a national treasure of 
        great cultural, environmental, ecological, and economic 
        importance;
            (2) the Basin contains over 12,500 square miles of land in 
        the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, 
        including nearly 800 square miles of bay and more than 2,000 
        tributary rivers and streams;
            (3) the Basin is home to more than 8,000,000 people who 
        depend on the Delaware River and the Delaware Bay as an 
        economic engine, a place of recreation, and a vital habitat for 
        fish and wildlife;
            (4) the Basin provides clean drinking water to more than 
        15,000,000 people, including New York City, which relies on the 
        Basin for approximately half of the drinking water supply of 
        the city, and Philadelphia, whose most significant threat to 
        the drinking water supply of the city is loss of forests and 
        other natural cover in the Upper Basin, according to a study 
        conducted by the Philadelphia Water Department;
            (5) the Basin contributes $25,000,000,000 annually in 
        economic activity, provides $21,000,000,000 in ecosystem goods 
        and services per year, and is directly or indirectly 
        responsible for 600,000 jobs with $10,000,000,000 in annual 
        wages;
            (6) almost 180 species of fish and wildlife are considered 
        special status species in the Basin due to habitat loss and 
        degradation, particularly sturgeon, eastern oyster, horseshoe 
        crabs, and red knots, which have been identified as unique 
        species in need of habitat improvement;
            (7) the Basin provides habitat for over 200 resident and 
        migrant fish species, includes significant recreational 
        fisheries, and is an important source of eastern oyster, blue 
        crab, and the largest population of the American horseshoe 
        crab;
            (8) the annual dockside value of commercial eastern oyster 
        fishery landings for the Delaware Estuary is nearly $4,000,000, 
        making it the fourth most lucrative fishery in the Delaware 
        River Basin watershed, and proven management strategies are 
        available to increase oyster habitat, abundance, and harvest;
            (9) the Delaware Bay has the second largest concentration 
        of shorebirds in North America and is designated as one of the 
        4 most important shorebird migration sites in the world;
            (10) the Basin, 50 percent of which is forested, also has 
        over 700,000 acres of wetland, more than 126,000 acres of which 
        are recognized as internationally important, resulting in a 
        landscape that provides essential ecosystem services, including 
        recreation, commercial, and water quality benefits;
            (11) much of the remaining exemplary natural landscape in 
        the Basin is vulnerable to further degradation, as the Basin 
        gains approximately 10 square miles of developed land annually, 
        and with new development, urban watersheds are increasingly 
        covered by impervious surfaces, amplifying the quantity of 
        polluted runoff into rivers and streams;
            (12) the Delaware River is the longest undammed river east 
        of the Mississippi; a critical component of the National Wild 
        and Scenic Rivers System in the Northeast, with more than 400 
        miles designated; home to one of the most heavily visited 
        National Park units in the United States, the Delaware Water 
        Gap National Recreation Area; and the location of 6 National 
        Wildlife Refuges;
            (13) the Delaware River supports an internationally 
        renowned cold water fishery in more than 80 miles of its 
        northern headwaters that attracts tens of thousands of visitors 
        each year and generates over $21,000,000 in annual revenue 
        through tourism and recreational activities;
            (14) management of water volume in the Basin is critical to 
        flood mitigation and habitat for fish and wildlife, and 
        following 3 major floods along the Delaware River since 2004, 
        the Governors of the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, 
        and Pennsylvania have called for natural flood damage reduction 
        measures to combat the problem, including restoring the 
        function of riparian corridors;
            (15) the Delaware River Port Complex (including docking 
        facilities in the States of Delaware, New Jersey, and 
        Pennsylvania) is one of the largest freshwater ports in the 
        world, the Port of Philadelphia handles the largest volume of 
        international tonnage and 70 percent of the oil shipped to the 
        East Coast, and the Port of Wilmington, a full-service 
        deepwater port and marine terminal supporting more than 12,000 
        jobs, is the busiest terminal on the Delaware River, handling 
        more than 400 vessels per year with an annual import/export 
        cargo tonnage of more than 4,000,000 tons;
            (16) the Delaware Estuary, where freshwater from the 
        Delaware River mixes with saltwater from the Atlantic Ocean, is 
        one of the largest and most complex of the 28 estuaries in the 
        National Estuary Program, and the Partnership for the Delaware 
        Estuary works to improve the environmental health of the 
        Delaware Estuary;
            (17) the Delaware River Basin Commission is a Federal-
        interstate compact government agency charged with overseeing a 
        unified approach to managing the river system and implementing 
        important water resources management projects and activities 
        throughout the Basin that are in the national interest;
            (18) restoration activities in the Basin are supported 
        through several Federal and State agency programs, and funding 
        for those important programs should continue and complement the 
        establishment of the Delaware River Basin Restoration Program, 
        which is intended to build on and help coordinate restoration 
        and protection funding mechanisms at the Federal, State, 
        regional, and local levels; and
            (19) the existing and ongoing voluntary conservation 
        efforts in the Delaware River Basin necessitate improved 
        efficiency and cost effectiveness, as well as increased 
        private-sector investments and coordination of Federal and non-
        Federal resources.

                        activated by the withdrawal or release of water
