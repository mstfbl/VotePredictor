     TITLE VII--SAFE DRINKING WATER AND CLEAN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

SEC. 7001. DEFINITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.

    In this title, the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency.

SEC. 7002. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON APPROPRIATIONS LEVELS AND FINDINGS ON 
              ECONOMIC IMPACTS.

    (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
Congress should provide robust funding for the State drinking water 
treatment revolving loan funds established under section 1452 of the 
Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12) and the State water 
pollution control revolving funds established under title VI of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.).
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds, based on an analysis sponsored by 
the Water Environment Federation and the WateReuse Association of the 
nationwide impact of State revolving loan fund spending using the 
IMPLAN economic model developed by the Federal Government, that, in 
addition to the public health and environmental benefits, the Federal 
investment in safe drinking water and clean water provides the 
following benefits:
            (1) Generation of significant Federal tax revenue, as 
        evidenced by the following:
                    (A) Every dollar of a Federal capitalization grant 
                returns $0.21 to the general fund of the Treasury in 
                the form of Federal taxes and, when additional spending 
                from the State revolving loan funds is considered to be 
                the result of leveraging the Federal investment, every 
                dollar of a Federal capitalization grant returns $0.93 
                in Federal tax revenue.
                    (B) A combined $34,700,000,000 in capitalization 
                grants for the clean water and State drinking water 
                State revolving loan funds described in subsection (a) 
                over a period of 5 years would generate $7,430,000,000 
                in Federal tax revenue and, when additional spending 
                from the State revolving loan funds is considered to be 
                the result of leveraging the Federal investment, the 
                Federal investment will result in $32,300,000,000 in 
                Federal tax revenue during that 5-year period.
            (2) An increase in employment, as evidenced by the 
        following:
                    (A) Every $1,000,000 in State revolving loan fund 
                spending generates 16\1/2\ jobs.
                    (B) $34,700,000,000 in Federal capitalization 
                grants for State revolving loan funds over a period of 
                5 years would result in 506,000 jobs.
            (3) An increase in economic output:
                    (A) Every $1,000,000 in State revolving loan fund 
                spending results in $2,950,000 in output for the 
                economy of the United States.
                    (B) $34,700,000,000 in Federal capitalization 
                grants for State revolving loan funds over a period of 
                5 years will generate $102,700,000,000 in total 
                economic output.

SEC. 7113. WATER SUPPLY COST SAVINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States is facing a drinking water 
        infrastructure funding crisis;
            (2) the Environmental Protection Agency projects a 
        shortfall of approximately $384,000,000,000 in funding for 
        drinking water infrastructure from 2015 to 2035 and this 
        funding challenge is particularly acute in rural communities in 
        the United States;
            (3) there are approximately 52,000 community water systems 
        in the United States, of which nearly 42,000 are small 
        community water systems;
            (4) the Drinking Water Needs Survey conducted by the 
        Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 placed the shortfall in 
        drinking water infrastructure funding for small communities, 
        which consist of 3,300 or fewer persons, at $64,500,000,000;
            (5) small communities often cannot finance the construction 
        and maintenance of drinking water systems because the cost per 
        resident for the investment would be prohibitively expensive;
            (6) drought conditions have placed significant strains on 
        existing surface water supplies;
            (7) many communities across the United States are 
        considering the use of groundwater and community well systems 
        to provide drinking water; and
            (8) approximately 42,000,000 people in the United States 
        receive drinking water from individual wells and millions more 
        rely on community well systems for drinking water.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
providing rural communities with the knowledge and resources necessary 
to fully use alternative drinking water systems, including wells and 
community well systems, can provide safe and affordable drinking water 
to millions of people in the United States.
    (c) Drinking Water Technology Clearinghouse.--The Administrator and 
the Secretary of Agriculture shall--
            (1) update existing programs of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture designed to 
        provide drinking water technical assistance to include 
        information on cost-effective, innovative, and alternative 
        drinking water delivery systems, including systems that are 
        supported by wells; and
            (2) disseminate information on the cost effectiveness of 
        alternative drinking water delivery systems, including wells 
        and well systems, to communities and not-for-profit 
        organizations seeking Federal funding for drinking water 
        systems serving 500 or fewer persons.
    (d) Water System Assessment.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, in any application for a grant or loan from the Federal 
Government or a State that is using Federal assistance for a drinking 
water system serving 500 or fewer persons, a unit of local government 
or not-for-profit organization shall self-certify that the unit of 
local government or organization has considered, as an alternative 
drinking water supply, drinking water delivery systems sourced by 
publicly owned--
            (1) individual wells;
            (2) shared wells; and
            (3) community wells.
    (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary of 
Agriculture shall submit to Congress a report that describes--
            (1) the use of innovative and alternative drinking water 
        systems described in this section;
            (2) the range of cost savings for communities using 
        innovative and alternative drinking water systems described in 
        this section; and
            (3) the use of drinking water technical assistance programs 
        operated by the Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture.

        treasure, the Lake Tahoe Basin is one of the outstanding 
        recreational resources of the United States, which--
