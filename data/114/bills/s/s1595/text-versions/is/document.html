or their effects, or gather evidence or other information pertaining to 
known or suspected criminal conduct, or conduct that is in violation of 
a statute or regulation.

SEC. 4. EXCEPTIONS.

    (a) This Act does not prohibit any of the following:
            (1) Patrol of borders.--The use of a MAVD by a Federal 
        entity to surveil national borders to prevent or deter illegal 
        entry of any persons or illegal substances at the borders.

                    (A) The use of a MAVD by a Federal entity when 
                exigent circumstances exist. For the purposes of this 
                paragraph, exigent circumstances exist when the Federal 
                entity possesses reasonable suspicion that under 
                particular circumstances, swift action is necessary--
                            (i) to prevent imminent danger of death or 
                        serious bodily harm to a specific individual;
                            (ii) to counter an imminent risk of a 
                        terrorist attack by a specific individual or 
                        organization;
                            (iii) to prevent imminent destruction of 
                        evidence; or
                            (iv) to counter an imminent or actual 
                        escape of a criminal or terrorist suspect.
                    (B) A Federal entity using a MAVD pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A)(i) must maintain a retrievable record 
                of the facts giving rise to the reasonable suspicion 
                that an exigent circumstance existed.
            (3) Public safety and research.--The use of a MAVD by a 
        Federal entity--
                    (A) to discover, locate, observe, gather evidence 
                in connection to, or prevent forest fires;
                    (B) to monitor environmental, geologic, or weather-
                related catastrophe or damage from such an event;
                    (C) to research or survey for wildlife management, 
                habitat preservation, or geologic, atmospheric, or 
                environmental damage or conditions;
                    (D) to survey for the assessment and evaluation of 
                environmental, geologic or weather-related damage, 
                erosion, flood, or contamination; and
                    (E) to survey public lands for illegal vegetation.
            (4) Consent.--The use of a MAVD by a Federal entity for the 
        purpose of acquiring information about an individual, or about 
        an individual's property or effects, if such individual has 
        given written consent to the use of a MAVD for such purposes.
            (5) Warrant.--A law enforcement party using a MAVD, 
        pursuant to, and in accordance with, a Rule 41 warrant, to 
        surveil specific property, persons or their effects.

SEC. 5. BAN ON IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) No Federal entity actor may make any intentional effort to 
identify an individual from, or associate an individual with, the 
information collected by operations authorized by paragraphs (1) 
through (3) of subsection (a), nor shall the collected information be 
disclosed to any entity except another Federal entity or State, tribal, 
or local government agency or department, or political subdivision 
thereof, that agrees to be bound by the restrictions in this Act.
    (b) The restrictions described in subsection (a) shall not apply if 
there is probable cause that the information collected is evidence of 
specific criminal activity.

SEC. 6. PROHIBITION ON USE OF EVIDENCE.

    No evidence obtained or collected in violation of this Act may be 
received as evidence against an individual in any trial, hearing, or 
other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, 
officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other 
authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision 
thereof.

SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON SOLICITATION AND PURCHASE.

    (a) A Federal entity shall not solicit to or award contracts to any 
entity for such entity to surveil by MAVD for the Federal entity, 
unless the Federal entity has existing authority to surveil the 
particular property, persons or their effects, of interest.
    (b) A Federal entity shall not purchase any information obtained 
from MAVD surveillance by a non-Federal entity if such information 
contains personal information, except pursuant to the express consent 
of all persons whose personal information is to be sold.

SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt any State law 
regarding the use of MAVDs exclusively within the borders of that 
State.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
