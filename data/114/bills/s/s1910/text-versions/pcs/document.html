disclosures to Congress, or to an authorized official of an executive 
agency or the Department of Justice, that are essential to reporting a 
substantial violation of law.
    (b) A nondisclosure agreement may continue to be implemented and 
enforced notwithstanding subsection (a) if it complies with the 
requirements for such agreement that were in effect when the agreement 
was entered into.

Financial Stability Act of 2010, as added by section 931(b) of this 
title, are issued.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this subtitle shall be 
construed to prohibit the Financial Stability Oversight Council

System from complying with any of the requirements of section 113A of

SEC. 934. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Appropriate federal banking agencies; bank holding 
        company.--The terms ``appropriate Federal banking agencies'' 
        and ``bank holding company'' have the meanings given those 
        terms in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
        U.S.C. 1813).
            (2) Nonbank financial company.--The term ``nonbank 
        financial company'' has the meaning given that term in section 
        102(a) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5311).
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
appropriate Federal banking agencies should seek to properly tailor 
prudential regulations and, in doing so, differentiate among bank 
holding companies and among nonbank financial companies supervised by 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System based on their 
capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities 
(including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and 
other risk-related factors, using existing authorities, including 
waiver authorities provided in statute or regulation.

SEC. 935. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY.

    Nothing in this title shall be construed to limit the supervisory, 
regulatory, or enforcement authority of a Federal banking agency (as 
defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1813)) to further the safe and sound operation of an institution that 
the Federal banking agency supervises, except as specifically provided 
in this title.

            (1) at the direction of the Agency, the enterprises have 
        executed a series of transactions in which the enterprises 
        share credit risk with the private sector;
            (2) in the risk-sharing transactions to date, the 
        enterprises have shared credit risk on pools of residential 
        mortgage loans that back securities on which an enterprise 
        either already guarantees or does not yet guarantee the timely 
        payment of principal and interest;
            (3) the risk that the enterprises have shared has been 
        either any loss suffered on the loans in the pool or any loss 
        in excess of some minimal level on loans in the pool;
            (4) to date, the vast majority of risk-sharing transactions 
        have involved either back-end risk sharing or the transfer of 
        the second loss position; and
            (5) the Agency should direct the enterprises to--
                    (A) engage in more front-end risk sharing in which 
                the first loss position is transferred; and
                    (B) retain data that can help inform policymakers 
                and the public about the impact to consumers, the 
                market, and the enterprises from such transactions.
