the Comptroller General of the United States shall--
            (1) conduct a study of the effects of forward capacity

        Transmission Organizations on--
                    (A) consumer prices for electricity;
                    (B) the installation of new electrical generation 
                systems;
                    (C) the preservation of existing electrical

        report describing the results of the study conducted under

        reasonable.
