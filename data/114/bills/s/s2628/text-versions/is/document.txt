     To authorize the National Emergency Medical Services Memorial 
    Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of 
           Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Emergency Medical Services 
Commemorative Work Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) each year, throughout the United States, the 850,000 
        first responders of Emergency Medical Services answer more than 
        30,000,000 calls to serve 22,000,000 patients in need of life-
        saving care and comfort at a moment of notice and without 
        reservation;
            (2) with little regard for their own safety and in the face 
        of all hazards, the first responders of Emergency Medical 
        Services respond across the spectrum of incidents from a 
        medical emergency of a single person to naturally occurring or 
        manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks that threaten 
        the entire United States;
            (3) the commitment of the first responders of Emergency 
        Medical Services to others, at a moment of notice and despite 
        risk, exemplifies the finest traditions of the spirit of the 
        people of the United States;
            (4) as an element of the homeland defense strategy of the 
        United States, Emergency Medical Services stands on the 
        ``Nation's first line of defense in the prevention and 
        mitigation of risk from terrorist attacks, man-made incidents, 
        and natural disasters'';
            (5) the first responders of Emergency Medical Services, 
        along with the members of Law Enforcement and Fire Services, 
        serving in both the public and private sectors as career and 
        volunteer emergency medical service providers--
                    (A) are a critical element of the homeland and 
                national security efforts of the United States; and
                    (B) provide for the domestic tranquility of the 
                citizens of the United States;
            (6) all too often the risks associated with the critical 
        role of Emergency Medical Services results in an unacceptable 
        rate of injury and fatality to first responders;
            (7) statistics compiled by the Department of Labor and the 
        National Highway Safety Administration indicate that Emergency 
        Medical Services providers--
                    (A) die in the line of duty at a rate more than 
                twice the national average for all occupational 
                fatalities; and
                    (B) experience an injury rate of virtually 100 
                percent during the careers of the providers;
            (8) the United States has historically and continually 
        relied on the selfless and ultimate sacrifices made by citizens 
        in service to the United States and the families and loved ones 
        of citizens in service to the United States, in order to 
        maintain the domestic tranquility, safety, and security of the 
        United States;
            (9) the first responders of Emergency Medical Services 
        continue to serve in this finest tradition, in the face of 
        unacceptable sacrifice, risk, and danger in service to the 
        United States and the citizens of the United States;
            (10) the scope of responsibility assumed by the first 
        responders of Emergency Medical Services is broad and unique; 
        and
            (11) the sacrifice and commitment of the first responders 
        of Emergency Medical Services in service to the United States 
        is deserving of a commemorative work that recognizes the 
        sacrifice and commitment of the first responders.
