                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect children's health 
  by denying any deduction for advertising and marketing directed at 
    children to promote the consumption of food of poor nutritional 
                                quality.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Subsidizing Childhood Obesity 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and 
        tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. Currently, more 
        than \1/3\ of children and adolescents in the United States are 
        overweight or obese.
            (2) A report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and 
        Trust for America's Health found that if the population of the 
        United States continues on its current trajectory, adult 
        obesity rates could exceed 60 percent in a number of States by 
        2030.
            (3) Health-related behaviors, such as eating habits and 
        physical activity patterns, develop early in life and affect 
        behavior and health in adulthood. The diets of American 
        children and adolescents depart substantially from recommended 
        patterns that put their health at risk. Overall, American 
        children and youth are not achieving basic nutritional goals. 
        They are consuming excess calories and added sugars and have 
        higher than recommended intakes of sodium, total fat, and 
        saturated fats.
            (4) According to a 2012 report from the Federal Trade 
        Commission, the total amount spent on food marketing to 
        children is about $2,000,000,000 per year.
            (5) Companies market food to children through television, 
        radio, Internet, magazines, product placement in movies and 
        video games, schools, product packages, toys, clothing and 
        other merchandise.
            (6) According to a comprehensive review by the National 
        Academy of Medicine, studies demonstrate that television food 
        advertising affects children's food choices, food purchase 
        requests, diets, and health. The Academy concluded that the 
        marketing of high-calorie foods to children and adolescents is 
        one of the major contributors to childhood obesity.
            (7) More than 80 percent of the food advertisements seen by 
        children on television are for foods of poor nutritional value.
            (8) A study published in the Journal of Law and Economics 
        and funded by the National Institutes of Health found that the 
        elimination of the tax deduction that allows companies to 
        deduct costs associated with advertising food of poor 
        nutritional quality to children could reduce the rates of 
        childhood obesity by 5 to 7 percent.
            (9) A study published in the Journal of Health Affairs 
        found that the elimination of the tax deduction for costs 
        described in paragraph (8) would save up to $260,000,000 in 
        health care costs and prevent nearly 130,000 cases of childhood 
        obesity over 10 years.

SEC. 3. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR ADVERTISING AND MARKETING DIRECTED AT 
              CHILDREN TO PROMOTE THE CONSUMPTION OF FOOD OF POOR 
              NUTRITIONAL QUALITY.
