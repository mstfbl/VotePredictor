SEC. 5. DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR.

    In carrying out the Early Action Compact Program, the Administrator 
shall--
            (1) recognize the commitment of each State, local, or 
        tribal area to voluntarily adopt an early, substantive, 
        enforceable, and scientifically based attainment plan with 
        early implementation of control measures by becoming a party to 
        an early action compact plan developed in accordance with this 
        Act;
            (2) provide technical assistance to States, Indian tribes, 
        and local areas in the development of early action compact 
        plans;
            (3) ensure prompt review and approval of submitted early 
        action compact plans;
            (4) in a case in which the Administrator denies a submitted 
        early action compact plan, provide an explanation of the reason 
        for denying the submitted early action compact plan;
            (5) in the case of the failure of an area subject to an 
        early action compact plan to achieve attainment status during 
        the period for which the plan is in effect, defer designation 
        of the area as a nonattainment area until the expiration of 
        that period if the area continues to meet the terms of the 
        plan, including any milestones established by the plan;
            (6) expeditiously designate an area as an attainment area 
        and impose no additional requirements other than the post-
        attainment plan if area monitors reflect attainment by not 
        later than the early action compact plan attainment date; and
            (7) in the case of the failure of a participating area to 
        comply with the Early Action Compact Program--
                    (A) withdraw approval under this Act of the early 
                action compact plan of the area; but
                    (B) provide reasonable opportunities for the area 
                to cure deficiencies before withdrawing that approval.

SEC. 6. WINTER OZONE PROVISIONS.

    (a) In General.--For each early action compact plan under this Act, 
the Administrator shall establish requirements relating to winter ozone 
levels, including timelines, that are separate from, but not more 
burdensome than, the requirements otherwise established under this Act.
    (b) Regulations.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
        regulations--
                    (A) to carry out the Early Action Compact Program; 
                and
                    (B) specifically to address and accommodate unique 
                and complex occurrences of winter ozone in accordance 
                with this section.
            (2) Requirements.--The regulations promulgated pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) shall provide--
                    (A) sufficient timelines for the Administrator and 
                State, local, and tribal governments to conduct air 
                shed inventories, scientific research and studies 
                necessary for the Administrator and State, local, and 
                tribal governments to identify winter ozone causes 
                (including precursors), and take appropriate actions 
                necessary--
                            (i)(I) to create accurate emissions 
                        inventories and carefully model winter ozone 
                        using the most current tools available; and
                            (II) over a sufficient period of time, 
                        comprehensively to identify the variety of 
                        situations that typically contribute to 
                        elevated winter ozone levels;
                            (ii)(I) to fully analyze best available 
                        science and data to determine background ozone 
                        levels; and
                            (II) to identify meteorological, 
                        geographical, and other factors leading to 
                        elevated winter ozone levels; and
                            (iii) to effectively identify, develop, and 
                        implement air pollution control strategies that 
                        the Administrator and State, local, and tribal 
                        governments agree are the highest-priority 
                        activities to reduce winter ozone levels; and
                    (B) notwithstanding section 3(a)(2)(D), given the 
                complexities of winter ozone occurrences, a minimum of 
                10 years after the date on which the Administrator 
                approves an early action compact plan for the reduction 
                of winter ozone levels under the Early Action Compact 
                Program.
