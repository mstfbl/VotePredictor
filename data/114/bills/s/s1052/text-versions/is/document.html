SECTION 1. ENERGY INFORMATION STUDY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Energy (referred to in this Act as the 
``Secretary'') shall complete a study, with opportunity for public 
comment--
            (1) on the impact of--
                    (A) State and local performance benchmarking and 
                disclosure policies, and any associated building 
                efficiency policies, for commercial and multifamily 
                buildings; and
                    (B) programs and systems in which utilities provide 
                aggregated information regarding whole building energy 
                consumption and usage information to owners of 
                multitenant commercial, residential, and mixed-use 
                buildings;
            (2) that identifies best practice policy approaches studied 
        under paragraph (1) that have resulted in the greatest 
        improvements in building energy efficiency; and
            (3) that considers--
                    (A) compliance rates and the benefits and costs of 
                the policies and programs on building owners, 
                utilities, tenants, and other parties;
                    (B) utility practices, programs, and systems that 
                provide aggregated energy consumption information to 
                multitenant building owners, and the impact of public 
                utility commissions and State privacy laws on those 
                practices, programs, and systems;
                    (C) exceptions to compliance in existing laws where 
                building owners are not able to gather or access whole 
                building energy information from tenants or utilities;
                    (D) the treatment of buildings with--
                            (i) multiple uses;
                            (ii) uses for which baseline information is 
                        not available; and
                            (iii) uses that require high levels of 
                        energy intensities, such as data centers, 
                        trading floors, and television studios;
                    (E) implementation practices, including disclosure 
                methods and phase-in of compliance;
                    (F) the safety and security of benchmarking tools 
                offered by government agencies, and the resiliency of 
                those tools against cyber attacks; and
                    (G) international experiences with regard to 
                building benchmarking and disclosure laws and data 
                aggregation for multitenant buildings.

Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the 
study.
