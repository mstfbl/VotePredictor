        appropriate committees of Congress a report on the annual 
        opportunity cost of each specific Federal spectrum band 
        assigned to, or otherwise allocated for use by, Federal 
        entities.
            (2) Scope.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall

        megahertz and 6000 megahertz, inclusive.
            (3) Requirements.--Each report submitted under paragraph 
        (1) shall--
                    (A) define the term ``opportunity cost'' as the 
                value of the spectrum, in dollar terms, as if such

                unlicensed basis to the highest commercial alternative 
                use that currently does not have access to that 
                spectrum;
                    (B) take into account the national security 
                implications, including mission effectiveness, of the 
                potential transfer of Federal spectrum and the ability 
                of Federal entities to move to new bands or share 
                existing bands, and any limitations on such moving or 
                sharing;
                    (C) take into account the time required to relocate 
                and the cost of any potential relocation or sharing of 
                spectrum;
                    (D) take into account observed market valuations 
                from spectrum auctions, secondary spectrum trading, and

                allocations; and
                    (B) determine whether such technologies and 
                equipment are the most spectrum-efficient available 
                compared to existing technology to assist in efficient 
                use of spectrum.
            (2) Scope.--Each study conducted under paragraph (1) shall

        account--
                    (A) limitations on the acceptance of new technology 
                and equipment such as design characteristics of 
                national security programs and acquisition challenges 
                associated with introducing new technologies into 
                complex defense programs with unique requirements, 
                including national security satellite programs; and

        under paragraph (1) determines that the technologies and 
        equipment of Federal entities operating on Federal spectrum 
        allocations are not the most spectrum-efficient available, the 
        Comptroller General shall determine--
                    (A) what the costs would be to upgrade such systems 
                to more up-to-date and readily available systems;
                    (B) what benefits would be gained from upgrading, 
                particularly any cost savings or increases in spectrum 
                utilization efficiency; and
                    (C) whether there are any potential problems with 
                upgrading to more up-to-date systems.
