convicted of an offense under section 932 or 933 of title 18, United 
States Code, and other offenses applicable to the straw purchases and 
firearms trafficking of firearms are subject to increased penalties in 
comparison to those currently provided by the guidelines and policy 
statements for such straw purchasing and firearms trafficking offenses. 
In its review, the Commission shall consider, in particular, an 
appropriate amendment to reflect the intent of Congress that straw 
purchasers without significant criminal histories receive sentences 
that are sufficient to deter participation in such activities. The 
Commission shall also review and amend its guidelines and policy 
statements to reflect the intent of Congress that a person convicted of 
an offense under section 932 or 933 of title 18, United States Code, 
who is affiliated with a gang, cartel, organized crime ring, or other 
such enterprise should be subject to higher penalties than an otherwise 
unaffiliated individual.
