                                 A BILL


 
    To protect the safety of the national airspace system from the 
    hazardous operation of consumer drones, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Drone Safety Act''.

SEC. 2. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATION OF CONSUMER DRONES.

    (a) Rulemaking.--For the purpose of allowing consumer drones to be 
operated without posing a danger to manned aircraft, the Administrator 
shall publish a final rule not later than 18 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act containing safety requirements applicable to 
the operation of consumer drones.
    (b) Applicability.--The final rule required by subsection (a) shall 
apply to consumer drones that--
            (1) are flown for hobby or recreational use; and
            (2) are not operated in accordance with a community-based 
        set of safety guidelines and within the programming of a 
        nationwide community-based organization.
    (c) Requirements.--The final rule required by subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) a maximum altitude above ground level for flight of 
        consumer drones;
            (2) circumstances or areas where flights are restricted 
        because of the risk of unsafe interactions with manned 
        aircraft, such as within an unsafe distance from an airport or 
        in the flight path of a manned aircraft;
            (3) circumstances or areas where flights are restricted 
        because of the risk to persons or property on the ground, such 
        as within an unsafe distance from urban areas, residential 
        areas, electrical infrastructure, transportation 
        infrastructure, amusement parks, or public areas where 
        spectators are present;
            (4) conditions that may require limitations on flight, such 
        as weather or time of day; and
            (5) any other requirement that the Administrator determines 
        is necessary to minimize the risk that a consumer drone will 
        collide with a manned aircraft or otherwise endanger the safety 
        of the national airspace system or persons and property on the 
        ground.

SEC. 3. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR MANUFACTURERS OF CONSUMER DRONES.

    (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish a final rule 
containing safety requirements applicable to consumer drones 
manufactured in, imported into, or sold in the United States.
    (b) Requirements.--The final rule required by subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) limitations on altitude for consumer drones, whether 
        through software or other technological means;
            (2) a means of preventing unauthorized operation within an 
        unsafe distance from an airport or in protected airspace;
            (3) a system that, through sensors and software or other 
        similar means, enables avoidance of collisions;
            (4) a technological means to maintain safety in the event 
        that a communications link between a consumer drone and its 
        operator is lost or compromised, such as by ensuring that the 
        drone autonomously lands safely in a particular location;
            (5) a requirement that a consumer drone be detectable and 
        identifiable to pilots and air traffic controllers, including 
        through the use of an identification number and a transponder 
        or similar technology to convey the drone's location and 
        altitude;
            (6) a means to prevent tampering with or modification of 
        any system, limitation, or other safety mechanism required by 
        the Administrator under this section or any other provision of 
        law, including a means to identify any tampering or 
        modification that has been made;
            (7) educational materials to be provided to a consumer who 
        purchases a consumer drone; and
            (8) such other requirements as the Administrator considers 
        necessary to ensure the safety of the national airspace system.
    (c) Updating Existing Consumer Drones.--
            (1) In general.--The final rule required by subsection (a) 
        shall require modification, at the manufacturer's expense, of 
        any consumer drone that was commercially distributed before the 
        publication of the rule so that, to the greatest extent 
        practicable, such consumer drones meet the requirements 
        prescribed under the rule.
            (2) Requirements for consumer drones that cannot be fully 
        updated.--If any consumer drone cannot be modified as described 
        in paragraph (1), the Administrator may authorize the operation 
        of the consumer drone in accordance with subsection (d).
            (3) Notification.--The final rule required by subsection 
        (a) shall include provisions to publicize and notify the owners 
        of consumer drones of the modifications required by paragraph 
        (1) and of the manufacturer's responsibility to pay for the 
        modifications.
    (d) Limited Exemptions Permitted.--In the final rule required by 
subsection (a), the Administrator may exempt a type of consumer drone, 
by virtue of its size, weight, operational capabilities, technological 
capabilities, or other characteristic, from a requirement under 
subsection (b) only if--
            (1) complying with that requirement is technologically 
        infeasible or cost-prohibitive for the type of consumer drone;
            (2) exempting the type of consumer drone from the 
        requirement does not create a hazard to users of the national 
        airspace system or the public or pose a threat to national 
        security;
            (3) the Administrator establishes requirements for the safe 
        operation of the consumer drone in the national airspace 
        system; and
            (4) the Administrator makes a determination under section 
        4(b) with respect to such exemption.

SEC. 4. SAFETY DETERMINATION REQUIRED TO AUTHORIZE OPERATION OF 
              CONSUMER DRONES.

    (a) Codification of Existing Federal Aviation Administration 
Policy.--No person may operate a consumer drone in the national 
airspace system without specific authority from the Federal Aviation 
Administration.
    (b) Safety Determination Required Before Issuance of Specific

            (1) Civil penalties.--The Administrator may impose a civil 
        penalty under section 46301 of title 49, United States Code, 
        for a violation of this Act or a regulation prescribed or order 
        or specific authority issued under this Act in the same manner 
        and to the same extent as the Administrator may impose a 
        penalty under such section 46301 for a violation of chapter 447 
        of such title (other than a violation of sections 44719 through 
        44723 of such chapter).
