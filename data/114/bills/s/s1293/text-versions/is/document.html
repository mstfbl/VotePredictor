        steam generating unit; or
            (2) any project designed to increase the efficiency of 
        converting coal to useful energy or to a feedstock for the 
        manufacture of other products.
    (b) Lead Agency.--The Department of Energy shall be the lead agency 
for the purposes of coordinating all requirements under Federal law 
with respect to eligible projects, including any requirements of--
            (1) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);

        action on all Federal authorizations relating to the eligible 
        project;
            (2) requiring that all permit decisions and related 
        environmental reviews under applicable Federal law shall be 
        completed not later than 1 year after the date on which a 
        complete application for each environmental review is 
        submitted, or as soon as practicable thereafter; and
            (3) coordinating, to the maximum extent practicable, any

            (1) any failure by a Federal agency to complete action on 
        the application by the date that is 1 year after the date on 
        which the complete application was submitted to the agency; and
            (2) any issuance of an action or order by a Federal agency 
        with respect to the application that is inconsistent with
