 To provide installation reutilization authority for arsenals, depots, 
                              and plants.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. INSTALLATION REUTILIZATION AUTHORITY FOR ARSENALS, DEPOTS, 
              AND PLANTS.

    (a) Modified Authority.--In the case of a military manufacturing 
arsenal, depot, or plant, the Secretary of the Army may authorize 
leases and contracts under section 2667 of title 10, United States 
Code, for a term of up to 25 years, notwithstanding subsection (b)(1) 
of such section, if the Secretary determines that a lease or contract 
of that duration will promote the national defense or be in the public 
interest for the purpose of--
            (1) helping to maintain the viability of the military 
        manufacturing arsenal, depot, or plant and any military 
        installations on which it is located;
            (2) eliminating, or at least reducing, the cost of 
        Government ownership of the military manufacturing arsenal, 
        depot, or plant, including the costs of operations and 
        maintenance, the costs of environmental remediation, and other 
        costs; and
            (3) leveraging private investment at the military 
        manufacturing arsenal, depot, or plant through long-term 
        facility use contracts, property management contracts, leases, 
        or other agreements that support and advance the preceding 
        purposes.
    (b) Delegation and Review Process.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Army may delegate the 
        authority provided by this section to the commander of the 
        major subordinate command of the Army that has responsibility 
        for the military manufacturing arsenal, depot, or plant or, if 
        part of a larger military installation, the installation as a 
        whole. The commander may approve a lease or contract under such 
        authority on a case-by-case basis or a class basis.
            (2) Review period.--Any lease or contract that is approved 
        utilizing the delegation authority under paragraph (1) is 
        subject to a 90-day hold period so that the Army real property 
        manager may review the lease or contract pursuant to paragraph 
        (3).
            (3) Disposition of review.--If the Army real property 
        manager disapproves of a contract or lease submitted for review 
        under paragraph (2), the agreement shall be null and void upon 
        transmittal by the real property manager to the delegating 
        authority of a written disapproval, including a justification 
        for such disapproval, within the 90-day hold period. If no such 
        disapproval is transmitted within the 90-day hold period, the 
        agreement shall be deemed approved.
            (4) Approval of revised agreement.--If, not later than 60 
        days after receiving a disapproval under paragraph (3), the 
        delegating authority submits to the Army real property manager 
        a new contract or lease that addresses the Army real property 
        manager's concerns outlined in such disapproval, the new 
        contract or lease shall be deemed approved unless the Army real 
        property manager transmits to the delegating authority a 
        disapproval of the new contract or lease within 30 days of such 
        submission.
    (c) Military Manufacturing Arsenal, Depot, or Plant Defined.--In 
this section, the term ``military manufacturing arsenal, depot, or 
plant'' means a Government-owned, Government-operated defense plant of 
the Army that manufactures weapons, weapon components, or both.
    (d) Sunset.--The authority under this section shall terminate at 
the close of September 30, 2019.

            Passed the Senate December 10 (legislative day, December 
      9), 2016.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
