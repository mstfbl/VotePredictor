                                 A BILL


 
     To prohibit implementation of a proposed rule relating to the 
definition of the term ``waters of the United States'' under the Clean 
  Water Act, or any substantially similar rule, until a Supplemental 
Scientific Review Panel and Ephemeral and Intermittent Streams Advisory 
       Committee produce certain reports, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Defending Rivers from Overreaching 
Policies Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) according to the testimony of Assistant Secretary of 
        the Army for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy at the House of 
        Representatives and Senate Joint Hearing on State and Local 
        Impacts of the Administration's Proposed Expansion of Waters 
        Regulation on February 4, 2015, that proposed expansion of 
        waters regulation ``is based on science including a peer-
        reviewed report on connectivity and the recommendations of 
        EPA's Science Advisory Board'';
            (2) the proposed rule entitled ``Definition of `Waters of 
        the United States' Under the Clean Water Act'' (79 Fed. Reg. 
        22188 (April 21, 2014)), was drafted before the science on 
        which the proposed rule was based had been reviewed by the 
        Scientific Advisory Board of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency;
            (3) the final review and synthesis of the scientific 
        evidence was released in January 2015, 2 months after the close 
        of the public comment period for the proposed rule;
            (4) the review and synthesis of the scientific evidence 
        found that ``the degree and downstream effects of those 
        connections [between parts of a watershed] vary spatially and 
        temporally'' and the ``connectivity of streams and wetlands to 
        downstream waters occurs along a continuum'';
            (5) the authors of the review and synthesis were unable to 
        place the water bodies in the case studies ``along a gradient 
        of connectivity'' and reported that ``the research community 
        has not reached a consensus regarding the best methods or 
        metrics to quantify or predict hydrologic or chemical 
        connectivity'';
            (6) without a scientific basis for evaluating the degree of 
        connectivity between a particular stream and a traditionally 
        navigable water, it is premature to use the scientific 
        literature to define which connections are ``significant'';
            (7) because the analysis of the relevant science was 
        completed after the proposed rule described in paragraph (2) 
        was drafted, and because the scientific review failed to 
        produce a method to assess the location of a particular water 
        body on a ``gradient of connectivity'', the resulting proposed 
        rule is not effectively based on science; and
            (8) because the likely cost of implementation of that 
        proposed rule will be greater than the $162,000,000 to 
        $278,000,000 cited in the testimony of Administrator of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency Gina McCarthy at the House of 
        Representatives and Senate joint hearing described in paragraph 
        (1), the proposal will have significant impacts on many sectors 
        of the United States economy.
