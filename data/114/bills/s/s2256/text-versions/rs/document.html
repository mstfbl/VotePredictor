                                 A BILL


 
  To establish programs for health care provider training in Federal 
health care and medical facilities, to establish Federal co-prescribing 
guidelines, to establish a grant program with respect to naloxone, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Co-Prescribing Saves Lives 
Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Together, the misuse of heroin and opioids 
        account for approximately 25,000 deaths in the United States 
        per year.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury 
        death in the United States in 2013, and among people 25 to 64 
        years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle 
        fatalities in 2013.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention, in the United States, fatal opioid-related drug 
        overdose rates have more than quadrupled since 1990 and have 
        never been higher. Each day in the United States, 46 people die 
        from an overdose of prescription painkillers. Nearly 2,000,000 
        Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on 
        opioids in 2013.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to 
        all opioid-related overdoses, including heroin and fentanyl, 
        and is a critical tool in preventing fatal opioid overdoses in 
        both health care and at-home settings.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The opioid overdose antidote naloxone has 
        reversed more than 26,000 overdose cases between 1996 and 2014, 
        according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TRAINING IN FEDERAL HEALTH CARE 
              AND MEDICAL FACILITIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        shall provide training to all providers described in subsection 
        (b), in accordance with subsection (c).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Department of veterans affairs guidelines.--

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Training Requirements.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Training topics.--The training developed under 
        paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) shall address, at

        prescribing of pain medications, principles of pain management, 
        the misuse potential of controlled substances, identification 
        of potential substance use disorders and referral to further 
        evaluation and treatment, and proper methods for disposing of 
        controlled substances.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Training approaches.--The training approaches 
        developed in accordance with this section may include both 
        traditional continuing education models and models that pair 
        intensive coaching for the highest volume prescribers with 
        case-based courses for other prescribers.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Consistency with consensus guidelines.--To the 
        extent practicable, training adopted under subsection (a) shall

              MEDICAL FACILITIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Naloxone Co-Prescribing Guidelines.--Not later than 
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Secretary of Health and Human Services

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Co-prescribing.--The term ``co-prescribing'' 
        means, with respect to an opioid overdose reversal drug, the 
        practice of prescribing such drug in conjunction with an opioid

        in conjunction with an opioid agonist approved under section 
        505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) 
        for the treatment of opioid use disorders, or in other

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Application.--To be eligible to receive a grant under

        identify State, local, or private funding to continue the 
        program after expiration of the grant.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Prioritization.--In awarding grants under this 
section, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible State 
departments of health that propose to base State guidelines on 
guidelines on co-prescribing already in existence at the time of 
application, such as guidelines of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
or national medical societies, such as the American Society of 
Addiction Medicine or American Medical Association.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Use of Funds.--A State department of health receiving 
a grant under this section may use the grant for any of the following

        providers and pharmacists on the co-prescribing of opioid 
        overdose reversal drugs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) To establish mechanisms and processes for 
        tracking patients participating in the program described in 
        paragraph (1) and the health outcomes of such patients, and 
        ensuring that health information is de-identified so as to 
        protect patient privacy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) To purchase opioid overdose reversal drugs for 
        distribution under the program described in paragraph 
        (1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) To offset the copayments and other cost-
        sharing associated with opioid overdose reversal drugs to 
        ensure that cost is not a limiting factor for eligible 
        individuals, as determined by the Secretary and the applicable 
        State department of health, giving priority to individuals not 
        otherwise insured for such services.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) To conduct community outreach, in conjunction 
        with community-based organizations, designed to raise awareness 
        of co-prescribing practices, and the availability of opioid 
        overdose reversal drugs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) To establish protocols to connect patients who

        criteria, such as the criteria of the American Society of 
        Addiction Medicine.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Evaluations by Recipients.--As a condition of receipt 
of a grant under this section, a State department of health shall, for

to assess the outcomes of the program funded by the grant.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Definition.--In this section, the term ``co-
prescribing'' has the meaning given such term in section 4.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
