                Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301) and a reimbursement 
                designation and a national coverage determination under 
                the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social 
                Security Act for certain medical products developed by 
                Medicare commercialization grant recipients; and
                    (B) increase the efficiency of, and communication 
                between, the Department of Health and Human Services 
                and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
            (3) Eligible participants.--The pilot program established

                commercialization grant under this subsection (b) who 
                choose to participate in such pilot program; and
                    (B) only for the review of eligible medical 
                products.
            (4) Parallel review process.--As part of the pilot 
        program--
                    (A) to the extent practicable, the Secretary and 
                the Administrator shall notify participating grant 
                recipients of the data that may be necessary for the 
                grant recipient to submit at the beginning of the 
                review process; and
                    (B) the Administrator shall begin review for 
                purposes of a reimbursement designation and a national 
                coverage determination under the Medicare program under 
                title XVIII of the Social Security Act for an eligible 
                medical product while the Secretary of Health and Human 
                Services is reviewing that eligible medical product for 
                approval under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
                (21 U.S.C. 301).
            (5) Allocation of resources.--The Administrator shall 
        allocate the resources necessary to carry out the pilot 
        program.
