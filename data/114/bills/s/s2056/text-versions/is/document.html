                                 A BILL


 
To provide for the establishment of the National Volcano Early Warning 
                         and Monitoring System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Volcano Early Warning and 
Monitoring System Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States and the territories of the United 
        States contain 169 hazardous volcanoes;
            (2) since 1980, eruptions have claimed many lives and cost 
        billions of dollars in property damage in the United States;
            (3) ash eruptions pose a hazard to high-flying jet 
        aircraft, including the more than 50,000 passengers who travel 
        on jets over Alaska and the North Pacific every day;
            (4) in 1989, an eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, caused 
        in-flight failure of all 4 engines of a passenger Boeing 747 
        aircraft;
            (5) international flights over the Commonwealth of the 
        Northern Mariana Islands and the intense domestic air traffic 
        of the Pacific Northwest also face potential engine failure in 
        the event of an eruption;
            (6) mudflows from ice-clad Cascade volcanoes of the States 
        of Washington, Oregon, and California pose a serious hazard to 
        cities and transportation arteries in the Pacific Northwest;
            (7) lava flows, toxic gas emissions, and explosions impact 
        residents and visitors to the State of Hawaii and have the 
        potential to cause catastrophic property damage;
            (8) frequent seismic unrest requires careful monitoring in 
        the Mammoth Lakes area of the State of California and 
        Yellowstone National Park in the States of Wyoming, Montana, 
        and Idaho;
            (9) modern technology, in the form of geophysical 
        monitoring networks on the ground and the use of near-real time 
        satellite data, makes possible early warnings typically weeks 
        or months before eruptions, giving emergency response agencies 
        and the public time to prepare, which minimizes potential 
        damage to property and loss of life;
            (10) the efficacy of monitoring is being demonstrated by--
                    (A) the successful forecasts and warnings of 
                Augustine Volcano in 1986 and 2006, Redoubt Volcano in 
                1989 through 1990 and 2009, and Mt. Spurr in 1992; and
                    (B) warnings and forecasts of lava flow advancement 
                in Hawaii during the ongoing eruption of Kilauea;
            (11) the United States Geological Survey and university and 
        State partners of the United States Geological Survey operate--
                    (A) the Alaska Volcano Observatory located in 
                Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska;
                    (B) the Cascades Volcano Observatory located in 
                Vancouver, Washington;
                    (C) the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory located in 
                Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii;
                    (D) the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory located in 
                Yellowstone National Park in the State of Wyoming, 
                Montana, and Idaho; and
                    (E) the California Volcano Observatory, located in 
                Menlo Park, California; and
            (12) a detailed survey of the volcanoes in the United 
        States and the monitoring status of those volcanoes has 
        revealed numerous serious monitoring gaps, leaving the United 
        States exposed to preventable damage from large volcanic 
        eruptions.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary
