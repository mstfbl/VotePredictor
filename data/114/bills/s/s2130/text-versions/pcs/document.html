regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, to local military 
commanders appointed by the Secretary of Defense, or by an officer or 
employee designated by the Secretary, to provide at their discretion ex 
gratia payments in amounts consistent with subsection (d) of this 
section for damage, personal injury, or death that is incident to 
combat operations of the Armed Forces in a foreign country.
    (b) An ex gratia payment under this section may be provided only 
if--
            (1) the prospective foreign civilian recipient is 
        determined by the local military commander to be friendly to 
        the United States;
            (2) a claim for damages would not be compensable under 
        chapter 163 of title 10, United States Code (commonly known as 
        the ``Foreign Claims Act''); and
            (3) the property damage, personal injury, or death was not 
        caused by action by an enemy.
    (c) Nature of Payments.--Any payments provided under a program 
under subsection (a) shall not be considered an admission or 
acknowledgment of any legal obligation to compensate for any damage, 
personal injury, or death.
    (d) Amount of Payments.--If the Secretary of Defense determines a 
program under subsection (a) to be appropriate in a particular setting, 
the amounts of payments, if any, to be provided to civilians determined 
to have suffered harm incident to combat operations of the Armed Forces 
under the program should be determined pursuant to regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary and based on an assessment, which should 
include such factors as cultural appropriateness and prevailing 
economic conditions.
    (e) Legal Advice.--Local military commanders shall receive legal 
advice before making ex gratia payments under this subsection. The 
legal advisor, under regulations of the Department of Defense, shall 
advise on whether an ex gratia payment is proper under this section and 
applicable Department of Defense regulations.
    (f) Written Record.--A written record of any ex gratia payment 
offered or denied shall be kept by the local commander and on a timely 
basis submitted to the appropriate office in the Department of Defense 
as determined by the Secretary of Defense.
    (g) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall report to the 
congressional defense committees on an annual basis the efficacy of the 
ex gratia payment program including the number of types of cases 
considered, amounts offered, the response from ex gratia payment 
recipients, and any recommended modifications to the program.
    Sec. 8109.  None of the funds available in this Act to the 
Department of Defense, other than appropriations made for necessary or 
routine refurbishments, upgrades or maintenance activities, shall be 
used to reduce or to prepare to reduce the number of deployed and non-
deployed strategic delivery vehicles and launchers below the levels set 
forth in the report submitted to Congress in accordance with section 
1042 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.
    Sec. 8110.  Of the funds provided for ``Research, Development, Test 
and Evaluation, Defense-Wide'' in this Act, not less than $2,800,000 
shall be used to support the Department's activities related to the 
implementation of the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA 
Act; Public Law 113-101; 31 U.S.C. 6101 note) and to support the 
implementation of a uniform procurement instrument identifier as 
described in 48 CFR subpart 4.16, to include changes in business 
processes, workforce, or information technology.
    Sec. 8111.  None of the funds made available in this or any other 
Act may be used to pay the salary of any officer or employee of the 
Department of Defense who approves or implements the transfer of 
administrative responsibilities or budgetary resources of any program, 
project, or activity financed by this Act to the jurisdiction of 
another Federal agency not financed by this Act without the express 
authorization of Congress:  Provided, That this limitation shall not 
apply to transfers of funds expressly provided for in Defense 
Appropriations Acts, or provisions of Acts providing supplemental 
appropriations for the Department of Defense.
    Sec. 8112.  It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Nation's fiscal challenges are a top priority for 
        Congress, and sequestration--non-strategic, across-the-board 
        budget cuts--remains an unreasonable and inadequate budgeting 
        tool to address the Nation's deficits and debt;
            (2) sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal 
        years 2016 and 2017;
            (3) sequestration relief should include equal defense and 
        non-defense relief; and
            (4) sequestration relief should be offset through targeted 
        changes in mandatory and discretionary categories and revenues.

            (1) the Arab League boycott of Israel, and the secondary

        States investment and trade in the Middle East and North 
        Africa;
            (2) the Arab League boycott, which was regrettably

        bring about the termination of the Arab League boycott of 
        Israel, including those to encourage allies and trading 
        partners of the United States to enact laws prohibiting 
        businesses from complying with the boycott and penalizing

                terrorism and terrorist financing in the West Bank and 
                Gaza, including the dismantling of terrorist 
                infrastructures, and is cooperating with appropriate 
                Israeli and other appropriate security organizations;

            (2) the Palestinian Authority (or the governing entity of a 
        new Palestinian state) is working with other countries in the 
        region to vigorously pursue efforts to establish a just, 
        lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that will 
        enable Israel and an independent Palestinian state to exist
