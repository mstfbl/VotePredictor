SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RISK 
              ADJUSTMENT.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should 
        periodically monitor and improve the Medicare Advantage risk 
        adjustment model to ensure that it accurately accounts for 
        beneficiary risk, including for those individuals with complex 
        chronic comorbid conditions;
            (2) the Secretary should closely examine the current 
        Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology to ensure that 
        plans enrolling beneficiaries with the greatest health care 
        needs receive adequate reimbursement to deliver high-quality 
        care and other services to help beneficiaries avoid costly 
        complications and further progression of chronic conditions and 
        to the extent data indicate this to be the case, the Secretary 
        should make necessary adjustment to the risk adjustment 
        methodology; and
            (3) the Secretary should reconsider the implementation of 
        changes in the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment methodology 
        finalized for 2016 and to use to the extent appropriate the 
        methodology finalized in 2015 for one additional year.
