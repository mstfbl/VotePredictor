        partners;
            (2) have sufficient airspace and range capabilities and 
        capacity to meet the training requirements;
            (3) have existing facilities to support personnel, 
        operations, and logistics associated with the flying mission;
            (4) have limited encroachment that would adversely impact

        States from terrorist air attack from inside or outside the 
        contiguous United States 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
            (2) These aircraft, stationed throughout the United States, 
        are tasked with the zero-fail mission of guarding and securing 
        United States airspace.
            (3) The United States is facing an increased threat from 
        both state and non-state actors.
            (4) The National Guard F-16 aircraft performing the 
        Aerospace Control Alert (ACA) mission are operating legacy 
        radar systems.
            (5) Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh testified 
        to Congress in March 2015, stating, ``We need to develop an 
        AESA radar plan for our F-16s who are conducting the homeland 
        defense mission in particular.''
            (6) First Air Force, United States Northern Command, issued 
        a Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON) request in March 2015 
        for radar upgrades to its F-16 fleet.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is essential to our Nation's defense that Air Force 
        aircraft modification funding is made available to purchase 
        these Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars as the 
        United States Air Force bridges the gap between 4th and 5th 
        generation fighters;
            (2) the United States Government must invest in radar 
        upgrades which ensure that 4th generation aircraft succeed at 
        this zero-fail mission; and
            (3) the First Air Force JUON request should be met as soon 
        as possible.

            (2) studies being conducted by the Armed Forces are 
        important to the development of these standards and should 
        incorporate the best scientific practices available; and
            (3) the Armed Forces should consider such studies on these 
        standards carefully in order to ensure that--
                    (A) such studies do not result in unnecessary 
                barriers to service in the Armed Forces; and
                    (B) all decisions on occupational assignments in 
                the Armed Forces--
                            (i) are based on an objective analysis of 
                        the tasks required to perform the occupational 
                        assignment concerned; and
                            (ii) do not negatively impact the required 
                        combat capabilities of the Armed Forces, 
                        including units whose primary mission is to 
                        engage in direct combat at the tactical level.

        Army National Guard or the Army Reserve, as applicable;
            (2) provide medical and mental health care services to

              SENTENCING RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
              FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Military families serve alongside their member of the 
        Armed Forces, enduring hardships, lending support, and 
        contributing to the member's career. These family members 
        endure frequent moves, long periods of separation, and other 
        unique hardships associated with military life.
            (2) Innocent family members are sometimes inadvertently 
        punished when the member they depend on forfeits retirement 
        benefit eligibility due to a court-martial sentence.
            (3) When a retirement-eligible member forfeits retirement 
        eligibility, that member's innocent family members lose the 
        security of benefits they had planned for and helped earn.
            (4) Military juries may choose to impose unjustly light 
        sentences on convicted members out of concern for the innocent 
        family members when a just sentence would require stripping the 
        member of retirement eligibility.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) that military juries should not face the difficult 
        choice between imposing a fair sentence or protecting the 
        benefits of a member of the Armed Forces for the sake of 
        innocent family members;
            (2) that innocent military family members of retirement-
        eligible members should not be made to forgo benefits they have 
        sacrificed for and helped to earn; and
            (3) to welcome the opportunity to work with the Department 
        of Defense to develop the necessary laws and regulations to 
        improve the military justice system and to protect the benefits 
        that military families have helped earn.

                and advisability of implementing the incentive program 
                throughout the TRICARE program.
            (3) Use of existing models.--In developing an incentive 
        program under this section, the Secretary may adapt a value-
        based incentive program conducted by the Centers for Medicare &

        health care program.
    (c) Termination.--The authority of the Secretary to carry out the

Needs.--
            ``(1) Determination of need for rapid acquisition and 
        deployment.--(A) In the case of any supplies and associated 
        support services that, as determined in writing by the 
        Secretary of Defense, are urgently needed to eliminate a 
        documented deficiency that has resulted in combat casualties, 
        or is likely to result in combat casualties, the Secretary may 
        use the procedures developed under this section in order to 
        accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of the needed 
        supplies and associated support services.
            ``(B) In the case of any supplies and associated support 
        services that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of 
        Defense, are urgently needed to eliminate a documented 
        deficiency that impacts an ongoing or anticipated contingency 
        operation and that, if left unfulfilled, could potentially 
        result in loss of life or critical mission failure, the 
        Secretary may use the procedures developed under this section 
        in order to accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of 
        the needed supplies and associated support services.
            ``(C)(i) In the case of any supplies and associated support 
        services that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of 
        Defense without delegation, are urgently needed to eliminate a 
        deficiency that as the result of a cyber attack has resulted in 
        critical mission failure, the loss of life, property 
        destruction, or economic effects, or if left unfilled is likely 
        to result in critical mission failure, the loss of life, 
        property destruction, or economic effects, the Secretary may 
        use the procedures developed under this section in order to 
        accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of the needed 
        offensive or defensive cyber capabilities, supplies, and 
        associated support services.
            ``(ii) In this subparagraph, the term `cyber attack' means 
        a deliberate action to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or 
        destroy computer systems or networks or the information or 
        programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks.
            ``(2) Designation of senior official responsible.--(A) 
        Whenever the Secretary makes a determination under subparagraph 
        (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) that certain supplies and 
        associated support services are urgently needed to eliminate a 
        deficiency described in that subparagraph, the Secretary shall 
        designate a senior official of the Department of Defense to 
        ensure that the needed supplies and associated support services 
        are acquired and deployed as quickly as possible, with a goal 
        of awarding a contract for the acquisition of the supplies and 
        associated support services within 15 days.
            ``(B) Upon designation of a senior official under 
        subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall authorize that official 
        to waive any provision of law, policy, directive, or regulation 
        described in subsection (d) that such official determines in 
        writing would unnecessarily impede the rapid acquisition and 
        deployment of the needed supplies and associated support 
        services. In a case in which the needed supplies and associated 
        support services cannot be acquired without an extensive delay, 
        the senior official shall require that an interim solution be 
        implemented and deployed using the procedures developed under 
        this section to minimize adverse consequences resulting from 
        the urgent need.
            ``(3) Use of funds.--(A) In any fiscal year in which the 
        Secretary makes a determination described in subparagraph (A), 
        (B), or (C) of paragraph (1), the Secretary may use any funds 
        available to the Department of Defense for acquisitions of

SEC. 803. MIDDLE TIER OF ACQUISITION FOR RAPID PROTOTYPING AND RAPID 
              FIELDING.

    (a) Guidance Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, in consultation with the 
Comptroller of the Department of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall establish guidance for a ``middle tier'' 
of acquisition programs that are intended to be completed in a period 
of two to five years.
    (b) Acquisition Pathways.--The guidance required by subsection (a) 
shall cover the following two acquisition pathways:
            (1) Rapid prototyping.--The rapid prototyping pathway shall 
        provide for the use of innovative technologies to rapidly 
        develop fieldable prototypes to demonstrate new capabilities 
        and meet emerging military needs. The objective of an 
        acquisition program under this pathway shall be to field a 
        prototype that can be demonstrated in an operational 
        environment and provide for a residual operational capability 
        within five years of the development of an approved 
        requirement.
            (2) Rapid fielding.--The rapid fielding pathway shall 
        provide for the use of proven technologies to field production 
        quantities of new or upgraded systems with minimal development 
        required. The objective of an acquisition program under this 
        pathway shall be to begin production within six months and 
        complete fielding within five years of the development of an 
        approved requirement.
    (c) Expedited Process.--
            (1) In general.--The guidance required by subsection (a) 
        shall provide for a streamlined and coordinated requirements, 
        budget, and acquisition process that results in the development 
        of an approved requirement for each program in a period of not 
        more than six months from the time that the process is 
        initiated. Programs that are subject to the guidance shall not 
        be subject to the Joint Capabilities Integration and 
        Development System Manual and Department of Defense Directive 
        5000.01, except to the extent specifically provided in the 
        guidance.
            (2) Rapid prototyping.--With respect to the rapid 
        prototyping pathway, the guidance shall include--
                    (A) a merit-based process for the consideration of 
                innovative technologies and new capabilities to meet 
                needs communicated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
                combatant commanders;
                    (B) a process for developing and implementing 
                acquisition and funding strategies for the program;
                    (C) a process for cost-sharing with the military 
                departments on rapid prototype projects, to ensure an 
                appropriate commitment to the success of such projects;
                    (D) a process for demonstrating and evaluating the 
                performance of fieldable prototypes developed pursuant 
                to the program in an operational environment; and
                    (E) a process for transitioning successful 
                prototypes to new or existing acquisition programs for 
                production and fielding under the rapid fielding 
                pathway or the traditional acquisition system.
            (3) Rapid fielding.--With respect to the rapid fielding 
        pathway, the guidance shall include--
                    (A) a merit-based process for the consideration of 
                existing products and proven technologies to meet needs 
                communicated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
                combatant commanders;
                    (B) a process for demonstrating performance and 
                evaluating for current operational purposes the 
                proposed products and technologies;
                    (C) a process for developing and implementing 
                acquisition and funding strategies for the program; and
                    (D) a process for considering lifecycle costs and 
                addressing issues of logistics support and system 
                interoperability.
            (4) Streamlined procedures.--The guidance for the programs 
        may provide for any of the following streamlined procedures:
                    (A) The service acquisition executive of the 
                military department concerned shall appoint a program 
                manager for such program from among candidates from 
                among civilian employees or members of the armed forces 
                who have significant and relevant experience managing 
                large and complex programs.
                    (B) The program manager for each program shall 
                report with respect to such program directly, without 
                intervening review or approval, to the service 
                acquisition executive of the military department 
                concerned.
                    (C) The service acquisition executive of the 
                military department concerned shall evaluate the job 
                performance of such manager on an annual basis. In 
                conducting an evaluation under this paragraph, a 
                service acquisition executive shall consider the extent 
                to which the manager has achieved the objectives of the 
                program for which the manager is responsible, including 
                quality, timeliness, and cost objectives.
                    (D) The program manager of a defense streamlined 
                program shall be authorized staff positions for a 
                technical staff, including experts in business 
                management, contracting, auditing, engineering, 
                testing, and logistics, to enable the manager to manage 
                the program without the technical assistance of another 
                organizational unit of an agency to the maximum extent 
                practicable.
                    (E) The program manager of a defense streamlined 
                program shall be authorized, in coordination with the 
                users of the equipment and capability to be acquired 
                and the test community, to make trade-offs among life-
                cycle costs, requirements, and schedules to meet the 
                goals of the program.
                    (F) The service acquisition executive, acting in 
                coordination with the defense acquisition executive, 
                shall serve as the milestone decision authority for the 
                program.
                    (G) The program manager of a defense streamlined 
                program shall be provided a process to expeditiously 
                seek a waiver from Congress from any statutory or 
                regulatory requirement that the program manager 
                determines adds little or no value to the management of 
                the program.
    (d) Rapid Prototyping Fund.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a 
        fund to be known as the ``Department of Defense Rapid 
        Prototyping Fund'' to provide funds, in addition to other funds 
        that may be available for acquisition programs under the rapid 
        prototyping pathway established pursuant to this section. The 
        Fund shall be managed by a senior official of the Department of 
        Defense designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The Fund shall consist 
        of amounts appropriated to the Fund and amounts credited to the 
        Fund pursuant to section 849 of this Act.

        be transferred to a military department for the purpose of 
        carrying out an acquisition program under the rapid prototyping 
        pathway established pursuant to this section. Any amount so 
        transferred shall be credited to the account to which it is 
        transferred. The transfer authority provided in this subsection 
        is in addition to any other transfer authority available to the 
        Department of Defense.
            (3) Congressional notice.--The senior official designated 
        to manage the Fund shall notify the congressional defense 
        committees of all transfers under paragraph (2). Each 
        notification shall specify the amount transferred, the purpose 
        of the transfer, and the total projected cost and estimated 
        cost to complete the acquisition program to which the funds 
        were transferred.

SEC. 842. RISK REDUCTION IN MAJOR DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAMS.

    (a) Guidance on Risk Reduction in Major Defense Acquisition 
Programs.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the acquisition 
strategy developed pursuant to section 2431a of title 10, United States 
Code, as added by section 841, for each major defense acquisition 
program for which development activities are required includes the 
following elements:
            (1) A comprehensive approach to continuously identifying 
        and addressing risk (including technical, cost, and schedule 
        risk) beginning at program initiation and continuing until the 
        start of full rate production as a means to improve 
        programmatic decision making and appropriately minimize and 
        manage program concurrency.
            (2) Documentation of the major sources of risk identified 
        and the approach to retiring that risk.
    (b) Elements of Comprehensive Approach to Risk Reduction.--The 
comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing risk for purposes 
of subsection (a)(1) shall include some combination of the following 
elements as appropriate for the item or system being acquired:
            (1) Development planning.
            (2) Systems engineering.
            (3) Integrated developmental and operational testing.
            (4) Preliminary and critical design reviews and technical 
        reviews.
            (5) Prototyping (including prototyping at the system or 
        subsystem level and competitive prototyping, where 
        appropriate).
            (6) Modeling and simulation.
            (7) Technology demonstrations and technology off ramps.

        subject matter experts.
            (13) Program phasing to address high risk areas as early as 
        possible.
    (c) Preference for Prototyping.--To the maximum extent practicable 
and consistent with the economical use of available financial 
resources, the milestone decision authority for each major defense 
acquisition program shall ensure that the acquisition strategy for the 
program provides for--
            (1) the production of competitive prototypes at the system 
        or subsystem level before Milestone B approval; or
            (2) if the production of competitive prototypes is not

after a program has incurred a unit cost increase greater than the 
significant cost threshold or critical cost threshold under section 
2433 of this title, except for exceptional circumstances.
    ``(4) For major defense acquisition programs where the service 
acquisition executive of the military service that is managing the 
program is the milestone decision authority--
            ``(A) the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that no 
        documentation is required outside of the military service 
        organization, without a determination by the Deputy Chief 
        Management Officer that the documentation supports a specific 
        statutory requirement and is implemented in a manner that will 
        not result in program delays or increased costs, and no 
        acquisition programmatic approvals shall be required outside of

in that position until the delivery of the first production units of 
such program upon submitting to the congressional defense committees a 
written determination that--
            (1) the program is so complex, and the delivery of the 
        first production units will take so long, that it would not be 
        feasible for a single individual to serve as program manager 
        for the entire period covered by such paragraph; and
            (2) the complexity of the program, and length of time that 
        will be required to deliver the first production units, are not 
        the result of a failure to meet the certification requirements 
        under section 2366a of title 10, United States Code.

            (1) The amount of the cost overrun or underrun on any major 
        defense acquisition program or subprogram in a fiscal year is 
        the difference between the current program acquisition unit 
        cost for the program or subprogram and the program acquisition 
        unit cost for the program as shown in the original Baseline 
        Estimate for the program or subprogram, multiplied by the 
        quantity of items to be purchased under the program or 
        subprogram, as reported in the final Selected Acquisition 
        Report for the fiscal year in accordance with section 2432 of 
        title 10, United States Code.
            (2) Cost overruns or underruns for covered major defense 
        acquisition programs that are joint programs of more than one 
        military department shall be allocated among the military 
        departments in percentages determined by the Under Secretary of 
        Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
            (3) The cumulative amount of cost overruns for a military 
        department in a fiscal year is the sum of the cost overruns and 
        cost underruns for all covered major defense acquisition 
        programs of the department in the fiscal year (including cost 
        overruns or underruns allocated to the military department in 
        accordance with paragraph (2)).
            (4) The cost overrun penalty for a military department in a 
        fiscal year is three percent of the cumulative amount of cost 
        overruns of the military department in the fiscal year, as 
        determined pursuant to paragraph (3), except that the cost 
        overrun penalty may not be a negative amount.
    (c) Transfer of Funds.--
            (1) Reduction of research, development, test, and 
        evaluation accounts.--Not later than 60 days after the end of 
        each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2015, the Secretary 
        of each military department shall reduce each research, 
        development, test, and evaluation account of the military 
        department by the percentage determined under paragraph (2), 
        and remit such amount to the Secretary of Defense.
            (2) Determination of amount.--The percentage reduction to 
        research, development, test, and evaluation accounts of a 
        military department referred to in paragraph (1) is the 
        percentage reduction to such accounts necessary to equal the 
        cost overrun penalty for the fiscal year for such department 
        determined pursuant to subsection (b)(4).
            (3) Crediting of funds.--Any amount remitted under 
        paragraph (1) shall be credited to the Rapid Prototyping Fund 
        established pursuant to section 803 of this Act.
    (d) Covered Programs.--A major defense acquisition program is 
covered under this section if the original Baseline Estimate was 
established for such program under section 2435(d) (1) or (2) on or 
after the date of the enactment of the Weapon Systems Acquisition 
Reform Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-23).

enactment of this Act, the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense 
for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, shall review Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01, the Manual for the 
Operation of the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System,

Regulation for Federal agencies to conduct appropriate market research 
before developing new requirements.

determinations for multiple procurements.
    (b) Required Elements.--The modification required by paragraph (1) 
shall, at a minimum--
            (1) provide that a written determination by an authorized 
        agency official that an item is a commercial item for the 
        purposes of section 2306a of title 10, United States Code, 
        shall be presumed to be valid for any subsequent procurement 
        unless the contracting officer for such procurement determines 
        in writing that the earlier determination was made in error or 
        was based on inadequate information; and
            (2) establish a process by which the contractor may appeal 
        a determination by a contracting officer that an earlier 
        determination was made in error or was based on inadequate

                consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
                Director of National Intelligence, of the actions that 
                would be taken prior to the transfer to a foreign 
                country of an individual detained at Guantanamo that 
                would substantially mitigate the risk of such 
                individual engaging or reengaging in any terrorist or 
                other hostile activity that threatens the United States 
                or United States person or interests.
                    (F) What additional authorities, if any, may be 
                necessary to detain an individual detained at 
                Guantanamo inside the United States as an unprivileged 
                enemy belligerent pursuant to the Authorization for Use 
                of Military Force, pending the end of hostilities or a 
                future determination by the Secretary of Defense that 
                such individual no longer poses a threat to the United 
                States or United States persons or interests.
                    (G) A plan for the disposition of any individuals 
                who are detained by the United States under the law of 
                armed conflict after the date of the report, including 
                a plan to detain and interrogate such individuals for 
                the purposes of--
                            (i) protecting the security of the United 
                        States, its persons, allies, and interests; and
                            (ii) collecting intelligence necessary to 
                        ensure the security of the United States, its 
                        person, allies, and interests.
            (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex.
    (h) Consideration by Congress of Secretary of Defense Plan.--
            (1) Terms of the resolution.--For purposes of this section 
        the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution 
        which is introduced within the 10-day period beginning on the 
        date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a 
        report under subsection (g) and--
                    (A) which does not have a preamble;
                    (B) the matter after the resolving clause of which 
                is as follows: ``That Congress approves the plan of the 
                Secretary of Defense on the disposition of detainees 
                held at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, 
                Cuba, under section 1032(g) of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 as submitted by 
                the Secretary of Defense to Congress on ______'', the 
                blank space being filled in with the appropriate date; 
                and
                    (C) the title of which is as follows: ``Joint 
                resolution approving the plan of the Secretary of 
                Defense on the disposition of detainees held at United 
                States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.''.
            (2) Referral.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) that 
        is introduced in the House of Representatives shall be referred 
        to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives. A resolution described in paragraph (1) 
        introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the Senate.
            (3) Discharge.--If the committee to which a resolution 
        described in paragraph (1) is referred has not reported such 
        resolution (or an identical resolution) by the end of the 20-
        day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary submits 
        to Congress a report under subsection (g), such committee shall 
        be, at the end of such period, discharged from further 
        consideration of such resolution, and such resolution shall be 
        placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.
            (4) Consideration.--(A) On or after the third day after the 
        date on which the committee to which such a resolution is 
        referred has reported, or has been discharged (under paragraph 
        (3)) from further consideration of, such a resolution, it is in 
        order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has 
        been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to 
        move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. A 
        Member may make the motion only on the day after the calendar 
        day on which the Member announces to the House concerned the 
        Member's intention to make the motion, except that, in the case 
        of the House of Representatives, the motion may be made without 
        such prior announcement if the motion is made by direction of 
        the committee to which the resolution was referred. All points 
        of order against the resolution (and against consideration of 
        the resolution) are waived. The motion is highly privileged in 
        the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate 
        and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, 
        or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the 
        consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the 
        vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not 
        be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        resolution is agreed to, the respective House shall immediately 
        proceed to consideration of the joint resolution without 
        intervening motion, order, or other business, and the 
        resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the 
        respective House until disposed of.
            (B) Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable motions 
        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not 
        more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
        favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the 
        resolution is not in order. A motion further to limit debate is 
        in order and not debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion 
        to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion 
        to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or 
        disagreed to is not in order.
            (C) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a 
        resolution described in paragraph (1) and a single quorum call 
        at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with 
        the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage 
        of the resolution shall occur.
            (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
        application of the rules of the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating 
        to a resolution described in paragraph (1) shall be decided 
        without debate.
            (5) Consideration by other house.--(A) If, before the 
        passage by one House of a resolution of that House described in 
        paragraph (1), that House receives from the other House a 
        resolution described in paragraph (1), then the following 
        procedures shall apply:
                    (i) The resolution of the other House shall not be 
                referred to a committee and may not be considered in 
                the House receiving it except in the case of final 
                passage as provided in clause (ii)(II).
                    (ii) With respect to a resolution described in 
                paragraph (1) of the House receiving the resolution--
                            (I) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no resolution had been received 
                        from the other House; but
                            (II) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                        the resolution of the other House.
            (B) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the 
        other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 
        resolution that originated in the receiving House.
            (6) Rules of the senate and the house of representatives.--
        This subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the 
                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a 
                resolution described in paragraph (1), and it 
                supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
                inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
                case of any other rule of that House.
    (i) Limitation on Transfer or Release of Detainees Transferred to 
the United States.--
            (1) Limitation pending enactment of joint resolution 
        approving plan.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and 
        subject to paragraph (2), any individual detained at Guantanamo 
        who is transferred to the United States after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act shall not be released within the United 
        States or its territories, and may only be transferred or 
        released in accordance with the procedures under section 1033.
            (2) Limitation on transfer overseas after enactment of 
        joint resolution approving plan.--Effective on the effective 
        date specified in subsection (f)--
                    (A) the provisions of section 1035 of the National 
                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public 
                Law 113-66; 127 Stat. 851; 10 U.S.C. 801 note), as 
                previously repealed by section 1033, shall be revived;
                    (B) the procedures under such section 1035, as so 
                revived, shall apply to the transfer of individuals 
                detained at Guantanamo to foreign countries rather than 
                the procedures under section1033; and
                    (C) in the application of procedures under such 
                section 1035 as described in subparagraph (B), any 
                reference to an individual detained at Guantanamo shall 
                be deemed to refer also to any such individual 
                transferred to the United States after such effective 
                date.
    (j) Repeal of Superseded Prohibition.--Section 1034 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66; 127 
Stat. 851), as amended by section 1033 of the Carl Levin and Howard P.

        the Department of Defense to transfer any individual detained 
        at Guantanamo to the custody or control of the individual's 
        country of origin, any other foreign country, or any other 
        foreign entity if there is a confirmed case of any individual 
        who was detained at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba, at any time after September 11, 2001, who was 
        transferred to such foreign country or entity and subsequently 
        engaged in any terrorist activity.
            (2) Exception.--Subject to subsection (e), paragraph (1) 
        shall not apply to any action taken by the Secretary to

        having lawful jurisdiction (which the Secretary shall notify 
        the appropriate committees of Congress of promptly after 
        issuance).
    (d) National Security Waiver.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (e), the Secretary 
        of Defense may waive the applicability to a detainee transfer 
        of a certification requirement specified in subparagraph (D) or 
        (E) of subsection (b)(1), or the prohibition in subsection (c), 
        if the Secretary certifies the rest of the criteria required by 
        subsection (b) for transfers prohibited by subsection (c) and, 
        with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in 
        consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, 
        determines that--
                    (A) alternative actions will be taken to address 
                the underlying purpose of the requirement or 
                requirements to be waived;
                    (B) in the case of a waiver of subparagraph (D) or 
                (E) of subsection (b)(1), it is not possible to certify 
                that the risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                have been completely eliminated, but the actions to be 
                taken under subparagraph (A) will substantially 
                mitigate such risks with regard to the individual to be 
                transferred;
                    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection (c), the 
                Secretary has considered any confirmed case in which an 
                individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and
                    (D) the transfer is in the national security 
                interests of the United States.
            (2) Reports.--Whenever the Secretary makes a determination 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress, not later than 30 days 
        before the transfer of the individual concerned, the following:
                    (A) A copy of the determination and the waiver 
                concerned.
                    (B) A statement of the basis for the determination, 
                including--
                            (i) an explanation why the transfer is in 
                        the national security interests of the United 
                        States;
                            (ii) in the case of a waiver of paragraph 
                        (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1), an explanation 
                        why it is not possible to certify that the 
                        risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                        have been completely eliminated; and
                            (iii) a classified summary of--
                                    (I) the individual's record of

SEC. 1034. AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY TRANSFER INDIVIDUALS DETAINED AT 
              UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO THE 
              UNITED STATES FOR EMERGENCY OR CRITICAL MEDICAL 
              TREATMENT.

    (a) Transfer for Emergency or Critical Medical Treatment 
Authorized.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this subtitle, or 
any other provision of law enacted after September 30, 2013, but 
subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may temporarily 
transfer any individual detained at Guantanamo to a Department of 
Defense medical facility in the United States for the sole purpose of 
providing the individual medical treatment if the Secretary determines 
that--
            (1) the Senior Medical Officer, Joint Task Force-Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba, has determined that the medical treatment is 
        necessary to prevent death or imminent significant injury or 
        harm to the health of the individual;
            (2) based on the recommendation of the Senior Medical 
        Officer, Joint Task Force-Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the medical 
        treatment is not available to be provided at United States 
        Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, without incurring 
        excessive and unreasonable costs;
            (3) the Department of Defense has provided for appropriate 
        security measures for the custody and control of the individual 
        during any period in which the individual is temporarily in the

        for the provision of medical treatment to prevent death or 
        imminent significant injury or harm to the health of the 
        individual, the estimated aggregate cost of providing the 
        individual medical treatment in a Department of Defense medical 
        facility in the United States (including the cost of 
        transferring and securing the individual in such facility 
        during any period in which the individual is temporarily in the 
        United States for treatment and the cost of treatment) would be

        medical treatment at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo 
        Bay.
    (b) Notice to Congress Required Before Transfer.--
            (1) In general.--In addition to the requirements in

                    (A) not later than 30 days before the date of the

                    (B) if notice cannot be provided in accordance with 
                subparagraph (A) because of an especially immediate 
                need for the provision of medical treatment to prevent 
                death or imminent significant injury or harm to the 
                health of the individual, as soon as is practicable,

                the individual.
                    (B) The specific Department of Defense medical

                individual.
                    (C) A description of the actions the Secretary 
                determines have been taken, or will be taken, to

              PERSONNEL TO ACCOMPLISH THE NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY.

    It is the sense of Congress that, as the Department of Defense 
makes decisions on military end strength requests, proper sizing of the

available to the Secretary in all locations worldwide in order to 
arrive at the proper mix and size of manpower to accomplish that 
Strategy without arbitrarily protecting or exempting any particular 
group or location of manpower.

SEC. 1048. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) As senior United States statesmen Dr. Henry Kissinger 
        wrote in testimony submitted to the Committee on Armed Services 
        of the Senate on January 29, 2015, ``[t]he United States has 
        not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the 
        end of the Second World War.''.
            (2) The rise of committed, non-state forces and near peer 
        competitors has introduced destabilizing pressures around the 
        globe.
            (3) Advances in information and weapons technology have 
        reduced the time available for the United States to prepare for 
        a respond to crises against either known or unknown threats.
            (4) The importance of the maritime domain cannot be 
        overstated. As acknowledged in the March 2015 Navy, Marine 
        Corps, and Coast Guard maritime strategy entitled ``A 
        Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower: Forward, 
        Engaged, Ready'', ``[o]ceans are the lifeblood of the 
        interconnected global community. . .90 percent of trade by 
        volume across the oceans. Approximately 70 percent of the 
        world's population lives within 100 miles of the coastline''.
            (5) In this global security environment, it is critical 
        that the United States possess a maritime forces whose mission 
        and ethos is readiness, a fight tonight force, forward 
        deployed, that can respond immediately to emergent crises 
        across the full range of military operations around the globe 
        either from the sea or home station.
            (6) The need for such forces was recognized by the 82nd 
        Congress during the Korean War, when it mandated a core mission 
        for the Nation's leanest force, the Marine Corps, to be most

        ground.
            (2) Significant amount.--For the purposes of this

        sects, and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full 
        integration into the Government and society of Iraq;

        citizens, and its interests; and
            (6) the Kurdistan Regional Government is the democratically 
        elected government of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and Iraqi 
        Kurds have been a reliable, stable, and capable partner of the

              EUROPE TO DETER AGGRESSION ON THE BORDER OF THE NORTH 
              ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the increased presence of United States and allied 
        ground forces in Eastern Europe since April 2014 has provided a 
        level of reassurance to North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO) members in the region and strengthened the capability of 
        the Organization to respond to any potential Russian aggression 
        against Organization members;
            (2) at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Wales summit 
        in September 2014 member countries agreed on a Readiness Action 
        Plan which is intended to improve the ability of the 
        Organization to respond quickly and effectively to security 
        threats on the borders of the Organization, including in 
        Eastern Europe, and the challenges posed by hybrid warfare;
            (3) the capability of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization to respond to threats on the eastern border of the 
        Organization would be enhanced by a more sustained presence on 
        the ground of Organization forces on the territories of 
        Organization members in Eastern Europe; and
            (4) an increased presence of United States ground forces in

        of European allies.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State, submit to the 
        congressional defense committees a report setting forth an 
        assessment of options for expanding the presence of United 
        States ground forces of the size of a Brigade Combat Team in 
        Eastern Europe to respond, along with European allies and 
        partners, to the security challenges posed by Russia and 
        increase the combat capability of forces able to respond to 
        unconventional or hybrid warfare tactics such as those used by 
        the Russian Federation in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.
            (2) Elements.--The report under this subsection shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An evaluation of the optimal location or 
                locations of the enhanced ground force presence 
                described in paragraph (1) that considers such factors 
                as--
                            (i) proximity, suitability, and 
                        availability of maneuver and gunnery training 
                        areas;
                            (ii) transportation capabilities;
                            (iii) availability of facilities, including 
                        for potential equipment storage and 
                        prepositioning;
                            (iv) ability to conduct multinational 
                        training and exercises;
                            (v) a site or sites for prepositioning of 
                        equipment, a rotational presence or permanent 
                        presence of troops, or a combination of

SEC. 1254. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON EUROPEAN DEFENSE AND NORTH ATLANTIC 
              TREATY ORGANIZATION SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, at 
        the 2014 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in Wales, 
        pledged to ``reverse the trend of declining defense budgets, to 
        make the most effective use of our funds and to further a more 
        balanced sharing of costs and responsibilities''.
            (2) Former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated on May 
        2, 2014, that ``[t]oday, America's GDP is smaller than the 
        combined GDPs of our 27 NATO allies. But America's defense 
        spending is three times our Allies' combined defense spending. 
        Over time, this lopsided burden threatens NATO's integrity, 
        cohesion, and capability, and ultimately both European and 
        transatlantic security''.
            (3) Former North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary 
        General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated on July 3, 2014, that 
        ``[d]uring the last five years, Russia has increased defense 
        spending by 50 percent, while NATO allies on average have 
        decrease their defense spending by 20 percent. That is not 
        sustainable, we need more investment in defense and security''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security and fiscal interests of 
        the United States that prompt efforts should be undertaken by 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to meet defense 
        budget commitments made in Declaration 14 of the Wales Summit 
        Declaration of September 2014;
            (2) the United States Government should continue efforts 
        through the Department of Defense and other agencies to 
        encourage North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies towards 
        meeting the defense spending goals set out at the Wales Summit;
            (3) some North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have 
        already taken positive steps to reverse declines in defense 
        spending and should continue to be supported in those efforts; 
        and
            (4) thoughtful and coordinated defense investments by 
        European allies in military capabilities would add deterrence 
        value to the posture of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        against Russian aggression and terrorist organizations and more 
        appropriately balance the share of Atlantic defense spending.

SEC. 1262. SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPLEMENTING 
              THE REBALANCE TO THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has a longstanding national interest 
        in maintaining security in the Asia-Pacific region.
            (2) The Asia-Pacific region is home to the world's three 
        largest economies, four most populous countries, and five 
        largest militaries. The Asia-Pacific's rapid economic growth 
        and mounting security tensions require a renewed focus from the 
        United States on the region to maintain security, expand 
        prosperity, and support common values.
            (3) In 2011, President Barack Obama announced that the 
        United States would rebalance to the Asia-Pacific. Since then, 
        there have been a number of actions taken to strengthen the 
        United States posture and relationships in the region, 
        including the negotiation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation 
        Agreement with the Philippines, the distributed laydown of the 
        United States Marines Corps in the Pacific, the rotational 
        stationing of the Littoral Combat Ship in Singapore, and a new 
        comprehensive partnership with Vietnam on defense and security.
            (4) Leaders in regional states remain concerned about a 
        variety of regional military challenges. These include China's 
        military modernization and its increasingly assertive actions 
        in the East and South China Sea and North Korea's continued 
        belligerence and its pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile 
        technology. United States allies and partners are looking to 
        the United States to demonstrate its willingness and ability to 
        maintain regional peace and security by fully implementing the 
        rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.
            (5) In April 2015, the Commander of the United States 
        Pacific Command Admiral Samuel Locklear warned, ``Our relative 
        superiority I think has declined and continues to decline. . 
        .we rely very heavily on power projection, which means we have 
        to be able to get the forces forward. . .''. Admiral Locklear 
        also noted, ``Any significant force structure moves out of my 
        AOR in the middle of a rebalance would have to be understood 
        and have to be explained because it would counterintuitive to a 
        rebalance to move significant forces in another direction.''
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in order to maintain the credibility of the United 
        States rebalance, it is vital that the United States continue 
        to shift forces to the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen the 
        ability of the United States Armed Forces to project power to 
        shape the choices of regional states and to deter, and if 
        necessary defend, against hostile military actions;
            (2) United States allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific 
        region, as well as potential adversaries, would take note of 
        any withdrawal of forces from the Asia-Pacific theater;
            (3) any withdrawal of United States forces from Outside the 
        Continental United States (``OCONUS'') Asia-Pacific region or 
        from United States Pacific Command would therefore seriously 
        undermine the rebalance; and
            (4) in order to properly implement United States rebalance 
        policy, United States forces under the operational control of 
        the United States Pacific Command should be increased 
        consistent with commitments already made by the Department of 
        Defense and aligned with the requirement to maintain a balance 
        of military power that favors the United States and United 
        States allies in the Asia-Pacific region.

SEC. 1263. SENSE OF SENATE ON TAIWAN ASYMMETRIC MILITARY CAPABILITIES 
              AND BILATERAL TRAINING ACTIVITIES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the United States, in accordance with the Taiwan 
        Relations Act (Public Law 96-8), should continue to make 
        available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may 
        be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
        defense;
            (2) the United States should continue to support the 
        efforts of Taiwan to integrate innovative and asymmetric 
        measures to balance the growing military capabilities of the 
        People's Republic of China, including fast-attack craft, 
        coastal-defense cruise missiles, rapid-runway repair systems, 
        offensive mines, and submarines optimized for defense of the 
        Taiwan straits;
            (3) the military forces of Taiwan should be permitted to 
        participate in bilateral training activities hosted by the 
        United States that increase credible deterrent capabilities of 
        Taiwan, particularly those that emphasize the defense of Taiwan 
        Island from missile attack, maritime blockade, and amphibious 
        invasion by the People's Republic of China;
            (4) toward that goal, Taiwan should be encouraged to 
        participate in exercises that include realistic air-to-air 
        combat training, including the exercise conducted at Eielson 
        Air Force Base, Alaska, and Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, 
        commonly referred to as ``Red Flag''; and
            (5) Taiwan should also be encouraged to participate in 
        advanced bilateral training for its ground forces, Apache 
        attack helicopters, and P-3C surveillance aircraft in island-
        defense scenarios.

        element--
                    ``(A) information relating to gross violation of 
                human rights by such force or element (including the 
                timeframe of the alleged violation);

SEC. 1633. ASSESSMENT OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nuclear competition among countries has become both 
        different and in some ways more complex than was the case 
        during the Cold War.
            (2) During the 25 years preceding the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, additional countries have obtained nuclear 
        weapons. North Korea is a nuclear-armed country and Iran 
        aspires to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.
            (3) A regional nuclear competition has emerged in South 
        Asia between India and Pakistan. Another such competition may 
        emerge in the Middle East between Iran and Israel, triggering a 
        nuclear proliferation cascade across the Middle East, involving 
        Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and perhaps other countries as well.
            (4) The proliferation of nuclear weapons to countries the 
        cultures of which are quite different from that of the United 
        States raises concerns regarding how leaders in those countries 
        calculate cost, benefit, and risk with respect to decisions 
        regarding the use of nuclear weapons.
    (b) Assessment Required.--The Director of Net Assessment of the 
Department of Defense shall, in coordination with the Commander of the 
United States Strategic Command, conduct an assessment of the global 
environment with respect to nuclear weapons and the role of United 
States nuclear forces, policy, and strategy in that environment.
    (c) Objectives.--The objectives of the assessment required by 
subsection (b) are to inform the long-term planning of the Department 
of Defense and policies relating to regional nuclear crises and 
operations that may involve the escalation of nuclear competition among 
countries.
    (d) Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--In conducting the assessment required by 
        subsection (b), the Director shall develop and analyze a range 
        of contingencies and scenarios, including crises that may 
        emerge from nuclear competition during the 10-year period 
        beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act that involve 
        the following:
                    (A) The United States and one other country that 
                possesses a nuclear weapon.
                    (B) The United States and multiple such countries.
                    (C) Two other such countries.
                    (D) Three or more other such countries.
                    (E) Regional and cross-regional geography, 
                including contingencies and scenarios in Europe, the 
                Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia, and 
                contingencies and scenarios that transcend regions.
                    (F) The long-term geopolitical and military-
                technical competition as it relates to nuclear weapons 
                and strategic warfare.
            (2) Analysis of competitive discontinuities.--In analyzing 
        the long-term geopolitical and military-technical competition 
        as it relates to nuclear weapons and strategic warfare under 
        paragraph (1)(F), the Director shall identify--
                    (A) prospective discontinuities in that

SEC. 1642. ADDITIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SENSOR COVERAGE FOR THE 
              PROTECTION OF THE UNITED STATES HOMELAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Director of the Missile Defense 
        Agency, there are two fundamental means for improving homeland 
        missile defense capability and capacity, ``one, is the 
        reliability of the interceptor, and two, is the discrimination 
        capability of the system''.
            (2) The Department of Defense will deploy a new midcourse 
        tracking radar to provide persistent coverage and improve 
        discrimination capabilities against threats to the United 
        States homeland from the Pacific region.
            (3) According to the Director of the Missile Defense 
        Agency, a long-range discrimination radar will provide larger 
        hit assessment coverage thereby enabling improved warfighting 
        capabilities to manage ground-based interceptor (GBI) inventory 
        and improve the capacity of the ballistic missile defense 
        system.
            (4) According to the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of 
        Defense for Policy, ``while Iran has not yet deployed an 
        intercontinental ballistic missile, its progress on space 
        launch vehicles--along with its desire to deter the United 
        States and its allies-- provides Tehran with the means and 
        motivation to develop longer-range missiles, including an ICBM. 
        Iran publically stated that it intends to launch a space-launch 
        vehicle as early as this year capable of intercontinental 
        ranges, if configured as such''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the currently deployed ground-based midcourse defense 
        system protects the entire United States homeland, including 
        the East Coast, against the threat of limited ballistic missile 
        attack from North Korea and Iran; and
            (2) additional missile defense sensor discrimination 
        capabilities are needed to enhance the protection of the United 
        States homeland against potential long-range ballistic missiles 
        from Iran that, according to the Department of Defense, could 
        soon be obtained by Iran as a result of its active space launch 
        program.
    (c) Deployment of Additional Coverage.--The Director of the Missile 
Defense Agency shall, in cooperation with the relevant combatant 
command, deploy by not later than December 31, 2020, a long-range 
discrimination radar or other appropriate tracking and discrimination 
sensor capabilities in a location optimized to support the defense of 
the homeland of the United States from emerging long-range ballistic 
missile threats from Iran.

SEC. 1661. MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO VIOLATIONS OF THE INTERMEDIATE-RANGE 
              NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On July 31, 2014, the Department of State released its 
        annual report entitled ``Adherence to and Compliance With Arms 
        Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and 
        Commitments'', which included the finding that ``[t]he United 
        States has determined that the Russian Federation is in 
        violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to 
        possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise 
        missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, 
        or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles''.
            (2) The United States has undertaken diplomatic efforts to 
        address with the Russian Federation its violations of the INF 
        Treaty since 2013, and the Russian Federation has failed to 
        respond to those efforts in any way.
            (3) The Commander of the United States European Command, 
        and Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Philip 
        Breedlove stated that ``[a] weapon capability that violates the 
        I.N.F., that is introduced into the greater European land mass, 
        is absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt with'' and 
        ``[i]t can't go unanswered''.
            (4) The Secretary of Defense has informed Congress that the 
        range of options in response to the violation by the Russian 
        Federation of the INF Treaty could include ``active defenses to 
        counter intermediate-range ground-launched cruise missiles; 
        counterforce capabilities to prevent intermediate-range ground-
        launched cruise missile attacks; and countervailing strike 
        capabilities to enhance U.S. or allied forces''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the development and deployment of a nuclear ground-
        launched cruise missile by the Russian Federation in violation 
        of the INF Treaty would pose a dangerous threat to the United 
        States and its allies;
            (2) the Russian Federation has established an increasing 
        role for nuclear weapons in its military strategy;
            (3) efforts taken by the President to compel the Russian 
        Federation to return to compliance with the INF Treaty must be 
        persistent and are in the best interests of the United States, 
        but cannot be open-ended; and
            (4) efforts by the United States to develop military and 
        nonmilitary options for responding to violations of the INF 
        Treaty could encourage the Russian Federation to return to 
        compliance with the INF Treaty.
    (c) Notification.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the President 
shall notify the appropriate congressional committees with respect to 
whether the Russian Federation--
            (1) has flight-tested, has deployed, or possesses a 
        military system that has achieved an initial operating 
        capability that is either a ground-launched ballistic missile 
        or ground-launched cruise missile with a flight-tested range of 
        between 500 and 5,500 kilometers; or
            (2) has begun taking measures to return to full compliance 
        with the INF Treaty, including verification measures necessary 
        to achieve high confidence that any missile described in 
        paragraph (1) will be eliminated.
    (d) Updates to Allies.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary 
of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall, in 
coordination with the Secretary of State and the Director of National 
Intelligence, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
report that describes--
            (1) the status of updates provided to the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization and other allies of the United States on 
        the Russian Federation's flight testing, operating capability, 
        and deployment of ground-launched ballistic missiles or ground-
        launched cruise missiles with a flight-tested range of between 
        500 and 5,500 kilometers; and
            (2) efforts to develop, with the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization and such allies, collective responses, including 
        economic and military responses, to arms control violations by 
        the Russian Federation, including violations of the INF Treaty.
    (e) Plan on Response Options.--
            (1) Military response options.--
                    (A) In general.--If, as of the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, the Russian Federation has not 
                begun taking measures to return to full compliance with 
                the INF Treaty, including by agreeing to verification 
                measures necessary to achieve high confidence that any 
                ground-launched ballistic missile or ground-launched 
                cruise missile with a flight-tested range of between 
                500 and 5,500 kilometers will be eliminated, the 
                Secretary of Defense shall, not later than 120 days 
                after such date of enactment, submit to Congress a plan 
                with respect to developing the following military 
                capabilities:
                            (i) Counterforce capabilities to prevent 
                        intermediate-range ground-launched ballistic 
                        missile and cruise missile attacks, whether or 
                        not such capabilities are in compliance with 
                        the INF Treaty and including capabilities that 
                        may be acquired from allies of the United 
                        States.
                            (ii) Countervailing strike capabilities to 
                        enhance the forces of the United States or 
                        allies of the United States, whether or not 
                        such capabilities are in compliance with the 
                        INF Treaty and including capabilities that may 
                        be acquired from allies of the United States.
                            (iii) Active defenses to defend against 
                        intermediate-range ground-launched cruise 
                        missile attacks.
                    (B) Cost and schedule estimates.--The Secretary 
                shall include, in the plan required by subparagraph 
                (A), with respect to each military capability described 
                in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of that subparagraph, 
                an estimate of cost and the approximate time for 
                achieving a Milestone A decision, if such a decision is 
                required.
                    (C) Availability of funds for recommended 
                capabilities.--The Secretary may use funds authorized 
                to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made 
                available for fiscal year 2016 for research, 
                development, test, and evaluation, Defense-wide, as 
                specified in the funding table in section 4201, to 
                carry out the development of capabilities pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A) that are recommended by the Chairman 
                of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to meet military 
                requirements and current capability gaps. In making 
                such a recommendation, the Chairman shall give priority 
                to such capabilities that the Chairman determines could 
                be tested and fielded most expediently, with the most 
                priority given to capabilities that the Chairman 
                determines could be fielded in two years.
            (2) Other response options.--The President shall include in 
        the plan required by paragraph (1)(A) such other options as the 
        President considers useful to encourage the Russian Federation
