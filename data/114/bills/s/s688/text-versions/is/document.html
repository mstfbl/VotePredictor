                                payments for discharges occurring 
                                during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and 
                                before the initial application of

                                for such risk adjustment as will take 
                                into account both a hospital's 
                                proportion of inpatients who are full-
                                benefit dual eligible individuals (as 
                                defined in section 1935(c)(6)) and the

    (b) Subsequent Adjustments Based on IMPACT and MedPAC Reports.--
Section 1886(q)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395ww(q)(4)(C)) is further amended by adding at the end the following 
new clause:
                            ``(iv) Risk adjustments under readmission

                        making recommendations under subparagraph (D) 
                        of section 2(d)(1) of the IMPACT Act of 2014 
                        (Public Law 113-185; 42 U.S.C. 1395lll note) 
                        with respect to the application of risk 
                        adjustment under this subsection, the Secretary 
                        is required to base such risk adjustment on the 
                        reports submitted under subparagraphs (A)(ii) 
                        and (B)(ii) of such section as well as on the 
                        report submitted by the Medicare Payment 
                        Advisory Commission under section 2(c) of the 
                        Establishing Beneficiary Equity in the Hospital 
                        Readmission Program Act of 2015. The 
                        Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & 
                        Medicaid Services shall incorporate such 
                        recommendations in carrying out risk adjustment 
                        under this subsection for discharges occurring 
                        in fiscal years after fiscal year 2017 in order 
                        to ensure that hospitals that treat the most 
                        vulnerable populations are not unfairly 
                        penalized by the program under this subsection. 
                        For fiscal years beginning more than 5 years 
                        after the date of submission of the report 
                        under section 2(d)(1)(B)(ii) of the IMPACT Act 
                        of 2014, the Secretary may use alternative 
                        adjustment mechanisms under this subsection to 
                        account for socioeconomic factors if the 
                        Secretary finds that such measures are better 
                        at accounting for socioeconomic factors than 
                        the mechanisms that would otherwise apply.''.
    (c) MedPAC Study on 30-Day Readmission Threshold.--The Medicare 
Payment Advisory Commission shall conduct a study on the 
appropriateness of using a threshold of 30 days for readmissions under 
section 1886(q)(5)(E) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395ww(q)(5)(E)). The Commission shall submit to Congress a report on 
such study in its report to Congress in June 2016.
    (d) Addressing Issue of Noncompliant Patients.--Section 
1886(q)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(q)(4)(C)), 
as amended by subsections (b) and (c), is further amended by adding at 
the end the following new clause:
                            ``(v) Consideration of exclusion of 
                        noncompliant patient cases based on v or other 
                        appropriate codes.--In promulgating regulations 
                        to carry out this subsection for the applicable 
                        period with respect to fiscal year 2017, the 
                        Secretary shall consider the use of V or other 
                        ICD-related codes for potential exclusions of 
                        cases in order to address the issue of 
                        noncompliant patients.''.
    (e) Excluding Certain Clinical Conditions.--
            (1) Study.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
                Services shall conduct a study, consistent with this 
                paragraph, that assesses and makes recommendations with 
                respect to excluding patients whose clinical conditions 
                or diagnoses may require frequent hospitalizations, 
                from the calculation of excess readmissions under 
                section 1886(q)(5)(E) of the Social Security Act (42 
                U.S.C. 1395ww(q)(5)(E)).
                    (B) Use of a technical expert panel.--The Secretary 
                shall convene a multi-stakeholder technical expert 
                panel comprised of individuals knowledgeable about 
                clinical care of hospitalized patients and quality 
                measurement, to provide input and recommendations on 
                the study conducted under this paragraph.
                    (C) Clinical conditions to be considered.--In 
                conducting the study, the Secretary shall consider 
                exclusions for patients with transplants, burns, 
                psychosis, and substance abuse disorders. The Secretary 
                may include additional clinical conditions where 
                appropriate care may require frequent hospitalizations.
                    (D) Transparency.--The Secretary shall make a draft 
                of report on such study available for public comment 
                for a period of not less than 30 days. The final study 
                and recommendations shall address the Secretary's 
                response to public comments.
                    (E) Deadline.--The Secretary shall submit a final 
                report on the study to Congress no later than Oct. 1, 
                2016. Such final report shall include recommendations 
                regarding the relevant clinical conditions that should 
                be excluded from the calculation of excess readmissions 
                described in subparagraph (A).
            (2) Application to calculation of excess readmissions.--
        Beginning with fiscal year 2018, the Secretary shall exclude 
        any relevant clinical conditions identified in the 
        recommendations made in the final report under paragraph (1)(E) 
        in determining a hospital's publicly reported readmission rate 
        and excess readmissions ratio under section 1886(q)(4)(C) of 
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(q)(4)(C)). The 
        Secretary also is encouraged to consider applying the 
        exclusions so identified to other Medicare public reporting and 
        pay-for-performance programs in which readmission measures are 
        used.
    (f) Budget Neutral Implementation.--The Secretary of Health and 
Human Services shall make such payment adjustment to subsection (d) 
hospitals under the inpatient prospective payment system under section 
1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) as may be necessary 
to ensure that the implementation of the this section (including the 
amendments made by this section) does not result in an increase in 
aggregate expenditures under such section 1886.
