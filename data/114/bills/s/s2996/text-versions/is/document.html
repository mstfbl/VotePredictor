                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase out tax preferences 
   for fossil fuels on the same schedule as the phase out of the tax 
                      credits for wind facilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fossil Aid is Inefficient and 
Regressive Energy Policy Act'' or the ``FAIR Energy Policy Act''.

SEC. 2. PHASE OUT OF TAX PREFERENCES FOR FOSSIL FUELS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) United States tax policy has provided tax preferences, 
        such as special deductions, special tax rates, tax credits, and 
        grants in lieu of tax credits, for oil and gas production for 
        100 years.
            (2) United States tax policy has provided tax preferences 
        for coal production for over 80 years.
            (3) In order to ensure that all sources of energy compete 
        on an equal footing, as tax credits for renewable energy are 
        phased out over the next 4 years, fossil fuel tax preferences 
        should be phased out on the same schedule.
    (b) Expensing of Intangible Drilling Costs.--Section 263 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended--
            (1) in subsection (c), by striking ``subsection (i)'' and 
        inserting ``subsections (i) and (j)'', and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(j) Phase Out of Deduction for Intangible Drilling Costs.--In the 
case of a dual capacity taxpayer which is a major integrated oil 
company (within the meaning of section 167(h)(5)), for any intangible 
drilling and development costs paid or incurred with respect to an oil 
or gas well, the amount of such costs allowed as a deduction under 
subsection (c) shall be reduced by--
            ``(1) in the case of any costs paid or incurred after 
        December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2018, 20 percent,
            ``(2) in the case of any costs paid or incurred after 
        December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2019, 40 percent,
            ``(3) in the case of any costs paid or incurred after 
        December 31, 2018, and before January 1, 2020, 60 percent, and
            ``(4) in the case of any costs paid or incurred after 
        December 31, 2019, 100 percent.''.
