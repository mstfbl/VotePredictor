                                 A BILL


 
        To promote international trade, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Gateways Trade 
Capacity Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The expansion of international trade is vital 
        to the economic growth and national security of the United 
        States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Stable trading relationships promote security 
        and prosperity, and leadership by the United States in 
        international trade fosters the expansion of open markets and 
        democracy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) United States aid to developing countries for 
        trade capacity building can have other positive side effects 
        such as promoting best practices, promoting good governance, 
        combating corruption, and reforming legal regimes.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Private sector-led trade and investment are 
        fundamental components of sustainable economic development and 
        growth. United States trade capacity assistance should 
        facilitate the reduction or elimination of non-tariff trade 
        barriers that inhibit the ability of developing countries to 
        implement trade agreements and participate in the global 
        economy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Reducing trade transaction costs through trade 
        capacity improvements and trade facilitation reforms will 
        assist United States exporters and small and medium-size 
        enterprises reach new customers in the developing world. 
        Reducing these costs through trade facilitation reforms will 
        assist developing country businesses to trade and invest with 
        each other and enter into and take advantage of global supply 
        and value chains.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) According to the United States Trade 
        Representative, ``the United States is the largest single-
        country provider of trade-related assistance'' (also called 
        trade capacity building assistance or ``Aid for 
        Trade'').&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) At the 9th Ministerial of the World Trade 
        Organization in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013, the 159 
        members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) concluded the 
        Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), the first global World 
        Trade Organization trade agreement in 20 years. The Members of 
        the WTO amended the WTO agreement to include the Trade 
        Facilitation Agreement on November 27, 2014, and opened it for 
        acceptance by members.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) The Trade Facilitation Agreement includes 
        measures and obligations designed to streamline customs 
        procedures, increase customs transparency, and speed the flow 
        of goods across borders.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) According to the Organization for Economic 
        Cooperation and Development, full implementation of the Trade 
        Facilitation Agreement could reduce trade costs by as much as 
        an estimated 16.5 percent of low income countries, 17 percent 
        for lower-middle income countries, 14.6 percent for upper-
        middle income countries, and 11.8 percent for OECD 
        countries.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) The Trade Facilitation Agreement contains 
        commitments by all World Trade Organization members to 
        implement commitments on trade facilitation under a timetable. 
        The TFA includes commitments by developed countries to assist 
        developing countries come into compliance with the obligations 
        of the TFA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) According to the Government Accountability 
        Office, in 2012, the United States Government spent nearly 
        $1,000,000,000 in trade capacity building efforts in 120 
        countries, which were implemented by 20 United States 
        Government departments and agencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) According to testimony provided by the 
        Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
        Development, there is no single coordinating agency for trade 
        capacity building activities in the United States Government. 
        Each agency has its own processes for ensuring proper and 
        effective programming of its appropriated funds.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) To enhance the effort to eliminate non-tariff 
        barriers, a clear, whole-of-government strategy with 
        appropriate coordination is needed to leverage limited trade 
        capacity funds to achieve the ambitious goals laid out in the 
        Trade Facilitation Agreement.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        countries;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) developing appropriate performance measures

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Gateways Trade Capacity Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Productive international trading relationships are 
        vital to the economic growth and national security of the 
        United States.
            (2) Stable trading relationships promote security and 
        prosperity, and leadership by the United States in 
        international trade fosters the expansion of open markets and 
        democracy and can help level the playing field for United 
        States businesses, workers, and consumers in the global 
        marketplace.
            (3) United States aid to developing countries for trade 
        capacity building can have other positive side effects such as 
        promoting best practices, promoting good governance, combating 
        corruption, promoting human rights, and reforming legal 
        regimes.
            (4) Private sector-led trade and investment are fundamental 
        components of sustainable economic development and growth. 
        United States trade capacity assistance should facilitate the 
        reduction or elimination of non-tariff trade barriers that 
        inhibit the ability of developing countries to implement trade 
        agreements and participate in the global economy.
            (5) Reducing trade transaction costs through trade capacity 
        improvements and trade facilitation reforms will assist United 
        States exporters and small and medium size enterprises reach 
        new customers in the developing world. Reducing these costs 
        through trade facilitation reforms will assist developing 
        country businesses to trade and invest with each other and 
        enter into and take advantage of global supply and value 
        chains.
            (6) According to the United States Trade Representative, 
        ``the United States is one of the largest single-country 
        providers of trade-related assistance'' (also called trade 
        capacity building assistance or ``Aid for Trade'').
            (7) At the 9th Ministerial of the World Trade Organization 
        in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013, the 159 members of the 
        World Trade Organization (WTO) concluded the Trade Facilitation 
        Agreement (TFA), the first global World Trade Organization 
        trade agreement in 20 years. The Members of the WTO amended the 
        WTO agreement to include the Trade Facilitation Agreement on 
        November 27, 2014, and opened it for acceptance by members.
            (8) The Trade Facilitation Agreement includes measures and 
        obligations designed to streamline customs procedures, increase 
        customs transparency, and speed the flow of goods across 
        borders.
            (9) According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
        and Development (OECD), full implementation of the Trade 
        Facilitation Agreement could reduce trade costs by as much as 
        an estimated 16.5 percent of low income countries, 17 percent 
        for lower-middle income countries, 14.6 percent for upper-
        middle income countries, and 11.8 percent for OECD countries.
            (10) The OECD has noted that trade barriers created by 
        ineffective policies and burdensome rules and procedures can 
        constitute an important incentive to engage in corrupt 
        behavior, and therefore all relevant stakeholders have an 
        interest in elaborating and promoting mutually supportive trade 
        integrity and facilitation policies that would remove 
        ineffective trade barriers while maintaining effective checks 
        and balances on fraud and corruption.
            (11) The Trade Facilitation Agreement contains commitments 
        by all World Trade Organization members to implement 
        commitments on trade facilitation under a timetable. The TFA 
        includes commitments by developed countries to assist 
        developing countries come into compliance with the obligations 
        of the TFA.
            (12) According to the Government Accountability Office, in 
        2012, the United States Government spent nearly $1,000,000,000 
        in trade capacity building efforts in 120 countries, which were 
        implemented by 20 United States Government departments and 
        agencies.
            (13) According to testimony provided by the Administrator 
        of the United States Agency for International Development, 
        there is no single coordinating agency for trade capacity 
        building activities in the United States Government. Each 
        agency has its own processes for ensuring proper and effective 
        programming of its appropriated funds.
            (14) To enhance the effort to eliminate non-tariff 
        barriers, a clear, whole-of-government strategy with 
        appropriate coordination is needed to leverage limited trade 
        capacity funds to achieve the ambitious goals laid out in the 
        Trade Facilitation Agreement and to realize the potential 
        benefits of productive international trading relationships for 
        United States businesses, workers, consumers, and foreign 
        trading partners.
