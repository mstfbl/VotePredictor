                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for the establishment of a mechanism to allow borrowers of 
    private education loans to refinance their loans, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Private Education Loan Modification 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) as of 2015, the Federal Reserve Consumer Credit Report 
        stated that there is more than $1,300,000,000,000 in 
        outstanding student loan debt in the United States, including 
        more than $150,000,000,000 in private education loans;
            (2) in 2008, 81 percent of individuals graduating with an 
        undergraduate degree with more than $40,000 in student loans 
        had a private education loan;
            (3) according to a 2012 study of the private student loan 
        market published by the Department of Education and the Bureau 
        of Consumer Financial Protection, there were 850,000 private 
        student loan defaults with an outstanding principal balance 
        more than $8,000,000,000;
            (4) the limited number of lenders in the private education 
        loan marketplace reduce the ability of borrowers with private 
        education loans to restructure, refinance, or negotiate 
        repayment terms for their current loans, leading to excessive 
        debt burdens and potential default;
            (5) as reported by the Student Loan Ombudsman of the 
        Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the 2014 annual report, 
        it appears that few, if any, private student lenders and loan 
        servicers have developed transparent, widely offered flexible 
        repayment options that mitigate defaults for borrowers in 
        distress;
            (6) excessive student indebtedness reduces economic 
        activity, threatens homeownership, hurts small business growth, 
        and limits opportunities for economic expansion across rural 
        and urban communities; and
            (7) as noted in 2013, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 
        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System encouraged 
        financial institutions to work constructively with private 
        student loan borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, so 
        borrowers have access to safe-and-sound lending practices.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to spur economic growth, 
by establishing a mechanism to allow borrowers of private education 
loans to refinance their loans in order--
            (1) to facilitate greater competition in the private 
        education lending and refinancing markets, particularly those 
        serving underserved and rural locations;
            (2) to address inefficiencies in the private education 
        lending and refinancing markets;
            (3) to encourage innovation in the private education 
        refinancing markets; and
            (4) to promote the participation of private capital in the 
        private education refinancing markets.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``private education loan'' has the same 
        meaning as in section 140(a) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 
        U.S.C. 1650(a)); and
            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, other than in the context of the Secretary of 
        Education.

SEC. 4. TEMPORARY AUTHORITY TO CREATE A CREDIT FACILITY TO INCREASE 
              MARKET EFFICIENCY IN THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET.

    (a) Authority.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Credit facilities authorization.--Upon a 
                determination by the Secretary that borrowers are 
                unable to secure adequate credit accommodations with 
                existing private education loans, the Secretary, 
                notwithstanding any provision of section 484 of the 
                Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1091), is 
                authorized to establish lending, purchase, and other 
                credit facilities to--
                            (i) accommodate reasonable refinancing 
                        opportunities or other loan adjustments that--
                                    (I) improve the sustainability of 
                                payments for the borrower; and
                                    (II) reduce the likelihood of 
                                delinquency and default on private 
                                education loans;
                            (ii) benefit borrowers that are most likely 
                        to have private student debt service 
                        obligations that represent a disproportionate 
                        share of their income; and
                            (iii) ensure that borrowers pay lower 
                        interest rates that are commensurate with 
                        credit risk, so that they may pursue more 
                        economically productive activities, such as 
                        home purchases and small business formation.
                    (B) Consultation.--
                            (i) In general.--Any determination under 
                        subparagraph (A) shall be made jointly with the

                        by the Secretary to establish a program to 
                        carry out the authority provided in this 
                        subsection, shall establish a compliance system

        Management and Budget.
    (b) Federal Register Notice.--Prior to exercising any authority 
provided under subsection (a), the Secretary shall publish a notice in 
the Federal Register to seek comment from interested parties on its 
proposed exercise of such authority, including--

        purchases, or other credit facilities authorized by subsection 
        (a);
            (2) an outline of methodology and factors considered in the 
        purchase or restructuring of private education loans;
            (3) private education loan modification options that may be 
        available for existing loans;
            (4) how they will ensure that borrowers whose education 
        debt service obligations represent a disproportionate share of 
        their income will be provided relief;
            (5) how the use of the methodology and factors, as proposed 
        in the notice, will be used to ensure that any exercise of 
        authority by the Secretary will result in no net cost to the 
        Federal Government; and
            (6) how any mechanism will be designed to avoid 
        extraordinary gains by market participants holding loans in 
        distress.

loan debt service obligations that represent a disproportionate share 
of their income.

credit facility is established under this Act, and not later than 5 
years after the date of enactment of this Act, any new lending,

SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Federal financial 
institutions, such as the Federal Financing Bank and the Federal 
Reserve banks, and federally chartered private entities, such as the 
Federal home loan banks, should consider, in consultation with the 
Secretary, the Secretary of Education, and the Director of the Bureau 
of Consumer Financial Protection, using available authorities in a 
timely manner, if needed, to assist in ensuring that borrowers of 
private education loans can secure credit accommodations to refinance 
existing loans, in a manner that results in no increased costs to 
taxpayers and will avoid extraordinary gains by market participants 
holding loans in distress in order to avoid unnecessary loan 
modifications.
