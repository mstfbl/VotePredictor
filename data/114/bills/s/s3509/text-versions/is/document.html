SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Asia-Pacific Maritime Security 
        Strategy issued by the Department of Defense in August 2015, 
        ``Although the United States takes no position on competing 
        sovereignty claims to land features in the region, all such 
        claims must be based upon land (which in the case of islands 
        means naturally formed areas of land that are above water at 
        high tide), and all maritime claims must derive from such land 
        in accordance with international law.''.
            (2) According to the annual report of the Department of 
        Defense to Congress on the military power of the People's 
        Republic of China submitted in April 2016, ``Throughout 2015, 
        China continued to assert sovereignty claims over features in 
        the East and South China Seas. In the East China Sea, China 
        continued to use maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to 
        patrol near the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in order to challenge 
        Japan's claim. In the South China Sea, China paused its land 
        reclamation effort in the Spratly Islands in late 2015 after 
        adding more than 3,200 acres of land to the seven features it 
        occupies in the archipelago. Although these artificial islands 
        do not provide China with any additional territorial or 
        maritime rights within the South China Sea, China will be able 
        to use them as persistent civil-military bases to enhance its 
        long-term presence in the South China Sea significantly.''.
            (3) On May 30, 2015, at the Shangri-la Dialogue of the 
        International Institute for Strategic Studies, Secretary of 
        Defense Ashton Carter stated that ``with its actions in the 
        South China Sea, China is out of step with both the 
        international rules and norms that underscore the Asia-
        Pacific's security architecture, and the regional consensus 
        that favors diplomacy and opposes coercion''.
            (4) On July 24, 2015, Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., noted at a 
        forum in Colorado that each year more than $5,300,000,000,000 
        in global sea-based trade passes through the South China Sea.
            (5) On June 4, 2016, at the Shangri-la Dialogue, Secretary 
        of Defense Ashton Carter stated: ``[T]he United States will 
        stand with regional partners to uphold core principles, like 
        freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful 
        resolution of disputes through legal means and in accordance 
        with international law. As I affirmed here last year, and 
        America's Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China 
        Sea have demonstrated, the United States will continue to fly, 
        sail and operate wherever international law allows, so that 
        everyone in the region can do the same.''.
            (6) On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration's 
        Tribunal organized pursuant to the United Nations Convention on 
        the Law of the Sea issued its unanimous award in the 
        arbitration instituted by Republic of the Philippines against 
        the People's Republic of China. The Tribunal noted that its 
        award is final and binding under that Convention.
            (7) Also according to the award, the Tribunal ``concluded 
        that, to the extent China had historical rights to resources in 
        the waters of the South China Sea, such rights were 
        extinguished to the extent they were incompatible with the 
        exclusive economic zones provided for in the Convention. The 
        Tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to 
        claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling 
        within the `nine-dash line'.''.
            (8) Also according to the award, the Tribunal ``held that 
        the Spratly Islands cannot generate maritime zones collectively 
        as a unit. Having found that none of the features claimed by 
        China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the 
        Tribunal found that it could--without delimiting a boundary--
        declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive 
        economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not 
        overlapped by any possible entitlement of China.''.
            (9) Also according to the award, the Tribunal ``found that 
        China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights in its 
        exclusive economic zone by (a) interfering with Philippine 
        fishing and petroleum exploration, (b) constructing artificial 
        islands and (c) failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from 
        fishing in the zone. The Tribunal also held that fishermen from 
        the Philippines (like those from China) had traditional fishing 
        rights at Scarborough Shoal and that China had interfered with 
        these rights in restricting access. The Tribunal further held 
        that Chinese law enforcement vessels had unlawfully created a 
        serious risk of collision when they physically obstructed 
        Philippine vessels.''.
            (10) On July 12, 2016, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
        the People's Republic of China issued a statement that China 
        ``declares that the [Tribunal] award is null and void and has 
        no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it. . . 
        . China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and 
        interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances 
        be affected by those awards. China opposes and will never 
        accept any claim or action based on those awards.''.
            (11) On July 12, 2016, the Government of the People's 
        Republic of China issued the fifth statement in the name of 
        that Government since 1979 that--
                    (A) stated that the People's Republic of China has 
                sovereignty over the 4 rocks and shoals in the South 
                China Sea;
                    (B) claims internal waters, territorial seas, 
                contiguous zones, one or more exclusive economic zones, 
                and a continental shelf based on that sovereignty 
                claim; and
                    (C) continues to claim historic rights in the South 
                China Sea.
            (12) On July 12, 2016, Assistant Secretary of State and 
        Department of State Spokesperson John Kirby noted that the 
        ``United States strongly supports the rule of law. We support 
        efforts to resolve territorial and maritime disputes in the 
        South China Sea peacefully, including through arbitration. . . 
        . we urge all claimants to avoid provocative statements or 
        actions. This decision can and should serve as a new 
        opportunity to renew efforts to address maritime disputes 
        peacefully.''.
            (13) On July 13, 2016, the Vice Foreign Minister of the 
        People's Republic of China, Liu Zhenmin, said that declaring an 
        air defense identification zone in the South China Sea would 
        depend on the threat China faces and stated that ``[i]f our 
        security is threatened, we of course have the right to set it 
        up''.
            (14) On July 18, 2016, the People's Liberation Army Air 
        Force of the People's Republic of China stated that it had 
        conducted a ``combat air patrol'' over the South China Sea and 
        that it would become ``regular practice'' in the future. A 
        spokesperson stated that the People's Liberation Army Air Force 
        ``will firmly defend national sovereignty, security and 
        maritime interests, safeguard regional peace and stability, and 
        cope with various threats and challenges''.
            (15) On August 2, 2016, the Supreme People's Court of the 
        People's Republic of China issued a judicial interpretation 
        that people caught illegally fishing in Chinese waters could be 
        jailed for up to one year.
            (16) In the Agreement concerning the Ryukyu Islands and the 
        Daito Islands with Related Arrangements, signed at Washington 
        and Tokyo June 17, 1971 (23 UST 446), between the United States 
        and Japan (commonly referred to as the ``Okinawa Reversion 
        Treaty''), the United States agreed to apply the Treaty of 
        Mutual Cooperation and Security, with Agreed Minute and 
        Exchanges of Notes (11 UST 1632), signed at Washington January 
        19, 1961, between the United States and Japan, to the area 
        covered by the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, including the Senkaku 
        Islands.
            (17) On October 30, 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary 
        Clinton stated that ``. . . with respect to the Senkaku 
        Islands, the United States has never taken a position on 
        sovereignty, but we have made it very clear that the islands 
        are part of our mutual treaty obligations, and the obligation 
        to defend Japan''.
            (18) In April 2014, President Barack Obama stated, ``The 
        policy of the United States is clear--the Senkaku Islands are 
        administered by Japan and therefore fall within the scope of 
        Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and 
        Security. And we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine 
        Japan's administration of these islands.''.

        civilian and military ships and aircraft of all countries 
        consistent with international law;
