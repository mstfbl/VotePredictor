                                 A BILL


 
    To provide for a temporary, emergency authorization of defense 
   articles, defense services, and related training directly to the 
         Kurdistan Regional Government, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The terrorist organization known as the Islamic State 
        of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses a grave threat to the 
        people and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, as well as 
        regional stability, and to the national security interests of 
        the United States and its allies and partners.
            (2) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant holds 
        significant territory in Iraq and Syria, has stated its 
        intention to seize more territory, and has demonstrated the 
        capability to do so.
            (3) Leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
        have stated that they intend to conduct terrorist attacks 
        internationally, including against the United States, its 
        citizens, and its interests.
            (4) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has committed 
        despicable acts of violence and mass executions against 
        Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not subscribe to its 
        depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology, and has threatened 
        genocide and committed vicious acts of violence against 
        religious and ethnic minority groups, including Iraqi 
        Christian, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations.
            (5) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has targeted 
        innocent women and girls with horrific acts of violence, 
        including abduction, enslavement, torture, rape, and forced 
        marriage.
            (6) According to United States intelligence estimates, 
        approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant fighters operate in Iraq and Syria, an estimated 3,000 
        of whom are believed to hold passports from western countries.
            (7) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant finances its 
        operations primarily through looting, smuggling, taxes, oil 
        sales, kidnapping, and human trafficking.
            (8) President Barack Obama articulated five lines of effort 
        in the campaign to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant, including supporting regional military partners, 
        stopping the flow of foreign fighters, cutting off the access 
        of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to financing, 
        addressing urgent humanitarian needs, and exposing the true 
        nature of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
            (9) As a result of advances by the Islamic State of Iraq 
        and the Levant in Iraq and Syria, approximately half of the 
        nearly 2,000,000 refugees and internally displaced people from 
        Syria and Iraq have taken refuge in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region 
        in northern Iraq.
            (10) The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is the 
        democratically elected government of the Iraqi Kurdistan 
        Region, and Iraqi Kurds have been a reliable, stable, and 
        capable partner of the United States, particularly in support 
        of United States military and civilian personnel during 
        Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn.
            (11) The Iraqi constitution guarantees the right of Iraqi 
        regions, such as the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, to maintain 
        ``internal security forces for the region such as police, 
        security forces, and guards of the region''.
            (12) The Kurdish Peshmerga forces are officially organized 
        under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and commanded by the 
        Minister of Peshmerga Affairs, who reports to the President of 
        the Kurdistan Regional Government.
            (13) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has 
        positioned its forces along a 650-mile border spanning five 
        Iraqi provinces and engaged in attacks on Peshmerga forces 
        defending the border.
            (14) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has employed 
        captured armored vehicles, long-range artillery, and heavy 
        weapons in attacking Kurdish forces along the border.
            (15) Kurdish Peshmerga forces have successfully retaken key 
        areas of Iraq formerly controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq 
        and the Levant, including Mount Sinjar, Mosul Dam, and Kirkuk.
            (16) The United States and its allies have provided the 
        resupply of various arms (including Hellfire missiles, anti-
        tank weapons, helmets and body armor, and ammunition) and 
        training to Peshmerga forces since June 2014.
            (17) Such resupply efforts, to comply with United States 
        law, must be approved and coordinated through the Government of 
        Iraq.
            (18) Masrour Barzani, the Chancellor of the Kurdistan 
        Region Security Council, described Peshmerga forces as 
        ``overstretched'' in the fight against the Islamic State of 
        Iraq and the Levant, and Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, the 
        representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government to the 
        United States, has expressed concern about ``shortfalls'' in 
        equipment.
            (19) According to the Kurdistan Regional Government, more 
        than 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga and Kurdish security forces have 
        been killed, and more than 5,000 have been wounded.
            (20) A strong Peshmerga force is essential to countering 
        the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to Iraq, 
        the region, and United States interests.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) poses 
        an acute threat to the people and territorial integrity of 
        Iraq, including the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and the security 
        and stability of the Middle East and the world;
            (2) defeating the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is 
        critical to maintaining a unified Iraq in which all faiths, 
        sects, and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full 
        integration into the Government and society of Iraq; and
            (3) any outstanding issues between the Government of Iraq 
        and the Kurdistan Regional Government should be resolved by the 
        two parties expeditiously to allow for a resumption of normal 
        relations.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to directly provide Kurdistan 
Regional Government military and security forces associated with the 
Government of Iraq with defense articles, defense services, and related 
training, on an emergency and temporary basis, to more effectively 
partner with the United States and other international coalition 
members to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

SEC. 4. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES, DEFENSE 
              SERVICES, AND RELATED TRAINING DIRECTLY TO THE KURDISTAN

        associated with the Government of Iraq for the purpose of
