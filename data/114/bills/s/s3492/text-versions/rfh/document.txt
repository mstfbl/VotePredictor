To designate the Traverse City VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic of 
 the Department of Veterans Affairs in Traverse City, Michigan, as the 
                  ``Colonel Demas T. Craw VA Clinic''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF COLONEL DEMAS T. CRAW VA CLINIC IN TRAVERSE 
              CITY, MICHIGAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Demas T. Craw was born on April 9, 1900, in Long Lake 
        Township, Michigan.
            (2) While residing in Traverse City, Michigan, Demas T. 
        Craw enlisted in the United States Army at Columbus Barracks, 
        Ohio, on April 18, 1918, and trained with the 12th Cavalry at 
        Camp Stanley, Texas.
            (3) Colonel Craw achieved the position of senior pilot and 
        was awarded--
                    (A) the Medal of Honor for action in North Africa;
                    (B) the World War I Victory Medal;
                    (C) the World War II Victory Medal;
                    (D) the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign 
                Medal;
                    (E) the Mexican Service Medal;
                    (F) the American Defense Service Medal;
                    (G) the Purple Heart;
                    (H) the Royal Order of George I; and
                    (I) the Observer Badge.
            (4) Colonel Craw's citation for the Medal of Honor said, 
        ``For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and 
        beyond the call of duty. On November 8, 1942, near Port 
        Lyautey, French Morocco, Col. Craw volunteered to accompany the 
        leading wave of assault boats to the shore and pass through the 
        enemy lines to locate the French commander with a view to 
        suspending hostilities. This request was first refused as being 
        too dangerous but upon the officer's insistence that he was 
        qualified to undertake and accomplish the mission he was 
        allowed to go. Encountering heavy fire while in the landing 
        boat and unable to dock in the river because of shell fire from 
        shore batteries, Col. Craw, accompanied by 1 officer and 1 
        soldier, succeeded in landing on the beach at Mehdia Plage 
        under constant low-level strafing from 3 enemy planes. Riding 
        in a bantam truck toward French headquarters, progress of the 
        party was hindered by fire from our own naval guns. Nearing 
        Port Lyautey, Col. Craw was instantly killed by a sustained 
        burst of machinegun fire at pointblank range from a concealed 
        position near the road.''.
            (5) Colonel Craw was killed in action on November 8, 1942, 
        while attempting to deliver a message to broker a cease fire 
        with France.
    (b) Designation.--The Traverse City VA Community-Based Outpatient 
Clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Traverse City, 
Michigan, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act be known 
and designated as the ``Colonel Demas T. Craw VA Clinic''.
    (c) Reference.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, 
document, paper, or other record of the United States to the community-
based outpatient clinic referred to in subsection (b) shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Colonel Demas T. Craw VA Clinic.

            Passed the Senate December 1, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                JULIE E. ADAMS,

                                                             Secretary.
