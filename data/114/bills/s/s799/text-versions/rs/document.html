_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To combat the rise of prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence 
                               syndrome.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Infants Act 
of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen 
        dramatically over the past several years. According to the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in some States, 
        there are as many as 96 to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 
        100 adults per year.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise 
        in the number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate 
        for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) At the same time, there has been an increase 
        in cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this 
        section as ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS 
        has risen from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 
        per 1,000 hospital births in 2009.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with 
        drug withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other 
        drugs in utero.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital 
        for NAS increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most 
        of these costs are born by the Medicaid program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women 
        and women of childbearing age is crucial.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Medically-appropriate opioid use in pregnancy 
        is not uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most 
        appropriate treatment for moderate to severe pain for pregnant 
        women.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on 
        women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from 
        preconception through early childhood.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription 
        drugs as prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of 
        prescription drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like 
        heroin.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, 
        it is most appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance 
        use in a non-punitive manner.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) According to a report of the Government 
        Accountability Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO 
        report''), more research is needed to optimize the 
        identification and treatment of babies with NAS and to better 
        understand long-term impacts on children.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) According to the GAO report, the Department 
        of Health and Human Services does not have a focal point to 
        lead planning and coordinating efforts to address prenatal 
        opioid use and NAS across the department.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the 
        increasing use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for 
        pain management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the 
        United States, it is important to improve the efficiency and 
        effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts 
        on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. DEVELOPING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTING AND TREATING 
              PRENATAL OPIOID ABUSE AND NEONATAL ABSTINENCE

                system to respond to and treat pregnant women with 
                opioid use disorders and infants born with neonatal

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) medically indicated use of opioids 
                during pregnancy;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) access to treatment for opioid use 
                disorders in pregnant and postpartum women;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) preventing, identifying, and treating 
                neonatal abstinence syndrome in infants;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) treating pregnant women who are 
                dependent on opioids; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) preventing opioid dependence among 
                women of reproductive age, including pregnant women, 
                who may be at risk of developing opioid 
                dependence.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        implementing effective public health measures, such as 
        disseminating information to educate the public, health care 
        providers, and other stakeholders on prenatal opioid use and 
        neonatal abstinence syndrome.
