                                 A BILL


 
  To combat the rise of prenatal opioid abuse and neonatal abstinence 
                               syndrome.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Infants Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen dramatically over 
        the past several years. According to the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention, in some States, there are as many as 96 
        to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 100 adults per year.
            (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the 
        number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate for 
        heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.
            (3) At the same time, there has been an increase in cases 
        of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this section as 
        ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS has risen 
        from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per 1,000 
        hospital births in 2009.
            (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with drug 
        withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other 
        drugs in utero.
            (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital for NAS 
        increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most of 
        these costs are born by the Medicaid program.
            (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women 
        of childbearing age is crucial.
            (7) Medically-appropriate opioid use in pregnancy is not 
        uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most appropriate 
        treatment for moderate to severe pain for pregnant women.
            (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of 
        childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from 
        preconception through early childhood.
            (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs as 
        prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of prescription 
        drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like heroin.
            (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, it is most 
        appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance use in a 
        non-punitive manner.
            (11) According to a report of the Government Accountability 
        Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO report''), 
        more research is needed to optimize the identification and 
        treatment of babies with NAS and to better understand long-term 
        impacts on children.
            (12) According to the GAO report, the Department of Health 
        and Human Services does not have a focal point to lead planning 
        and coordinating efforts to address prenatal opioid use and NAS 
        across the department.
            (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the increasing 
        use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for pain 
        management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the United 
        States, it is important to improve the efficiency and 
        effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts 
        on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.

        term outcomes of neonatal abstinence syndrome, including the 
        identification and treatment of pregnant women or women who may 
        become pregnant who use opioids or other drugs;
            (2) an evaluation of--
                    (A) the causes of and risk factors for opioid use

                young children;
                    (C) current practices in the health care system to 
                respond to and treat pregnant women with opioid use 
                disorders and infants born with neonatal abstinence 
                syndrome;
                    (D) medically indicated use of opioids during

                abstinence syndrome in infants;
                    (B) treating pregnant women who are dependent on 
                opioids; and
                    (C) preventing opioid dependence among women of 
                reproductive age, including pregnant women, who may be 
                at risk of developing opioid dependence.
