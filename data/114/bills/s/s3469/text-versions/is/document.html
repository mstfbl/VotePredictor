SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Joint Declaration of the Government of the United 
        Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of 
        Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 (in this Act 
        referred to as the ``Joint Declaration'')--
                    (A) provided that the People's Republic of China 
                resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997; and
                    (B) established a ``high degree of autonomy'' for 
                Hong Kong except in matters of foreign affairs and 
                defense.
            (2) The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
        Region of the People's Republic of China (in this Act referred 
        to as ``Basic Law'')--
                    (A) guarantees Hong Kong a ``high degree of 
                autonomy'' and separate executive, legislative, and 
                independent judicial powers;
                    (B) generally prohibits the central Government of 
                the People's Republic of China from interfering in the 
                affairs that Hong Kong administers on its own according 
                to the Basic Law;
                    (C) protects the rights to free speech, press, 
                assembly, and religion;
                    (D) guarantees residents of Hong Kong ``the freedom 
                of the person'', meaning ``no Hong Kong resident shall 
                be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention 
                or imprisonment'';
                    (E) guarantees residents of Hong Kong ``the right 
                to confidential legal advice, access to the courts, 
                choice of lawyers for timely protection of their lawful 
                rights and interests or for representation in the 
                courts, and to judicial remedies'';
                    (F) provides that the socialist system and policies 
                shall not be practiced in Hong Kong and that Hong 
                Kong's capitalist system and way of life shall remain 
                unchanged for 50 years (the principle of ``one country, 
                two systems'');
                    (G) affirms the continuing applicability of the 
                International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to 
                Hong Kong;
                    (H) provides that the head of the Hong Kong Special 
                Administrative Region shall be the Chief Executive;
                    (I) provides that ``the ultimate aim is the 
                selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage 
                upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating 
                committee in accordance with democratic procedures'';
                    (J) provides that the legislature of the Hong Kong 
                Special Administrative Region shall be the Legislative 
                Council; and
                    (K) provides that ``the ultimate aim is the 
                election of all the members of the Legislative Council 
                by universal suffrage''.
            (3) The National People's Congress Standing Committee 
        (NPCSC) determined on December 29, 2007, that Hong Kong could 
        elect the Chief Executive by universal suffrage beginning in 
        2017, and that Hong Kong could thereafter elect the Legislative 
        Council by universal suffrage beginning in 2020.
            (4) The Chief Executive is currently selected by an 
        Election Committee consisting of 1,200 members. In order to 
        run, candidates for Chief Executive must currently receive the 
        support of one-eighth of the members of the Election Committee, 
        the majority of whom reportedly support or have ties to the 
        Chinese Communist Party.
            (5) On August 31, 2014, the NPCSC determined that the 2017 
        election for the Chief Executive could be held by universal 
        suffrage but that Hong Kong voters could only choose from two 
        to three candidates, each of whom is to be chosen by a majority 
        of a nominating committee similar to the current Election 
        Committee that is heavily controlled by pro-Beijing members.
            (6) International standards for elections, including 
        Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
        Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights, guarantee citizens the right to vote and to be elected 
        in genuine periodic elections by universal and equal suffrage 
        without unreasonable restrictions.
            (7) Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents have 
        consistently and peacefully expressed their dissatisfaction 
        with the electoral reform plans of the Hong Kong government and 
        the Government of the People's Republic of China, including the 
        August 2014 NPCSC decision, and have called for a genuine 
        choice in elections that meet international standards. Their 
        peaceful and orderly protests have set an example for other 
        democratic movements around the world, including those in 
        mainland China that continue to fight for their fundamental 
        freedoms.
            (8) Media reports and video footage indicate that Hong Kong 
        police used tear gas and pepper spray against pro-democracy 
        demonstrators on September 28, 2014. There have also been 
        accusations of excessive use of force by the Hong Kong police, 
        but no police officer has yet been convicted.
            (9) Protestors and pro-democracy activists reported 
        sustained harassment and intimidation during and after the 
        demonstrations, including hacking of their email accounts or 
        phone, by groups reportedly connected to the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China.
            (10) Some protestors and activists have been unable to 
        travel to mainland China due to their participation in the 
        demonstrations, which has a direct bearing on their future 
        employment prospects. Pro-democracy advocates claim that the 
        Governments of the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong 
        have assembled ``blacklists'' of activists banned from entering 
        mainland China.
            (11) Several prominent student leaders, including Joshua 
        Wong, leader of the now dissolved student activist group 
        Scholarism and Secretary-General of the political party 
        Demosisto, Nathan Law, former General Secretary of the Hong 
        Kong Federation of Students and now member of the Legislative 
        Council, and Alex Chow, the former General Secretary of the 
        Hong Kong Federation of Students, had legal charges levied 
        against them due to their participation in pro-democracy 
        protest activities in September 2014. Wong and Chow were 
        convicted of ``unlawful assembly'' while Law was convicted of 
        ``incitement'', offenses under Hong Kong's Public Order 
        Ordinance, which is incompatible with international standards 
        on the freedom of assembly.
            (12) Ahead of the September 2016 Legislative Council 
        election, the Electoral Affairs Commission in Hong Kong issued 
        a new ``confirmation form'' for Legislative Council candidates 
        to sign confirming their commitment to uphold the Basic Law, 
        specifically the provisions holding that the territory is an 
        inalienable part of China. Six pro-independence candidates were 
        disqualified for failing to do so. This new requirement has 
        been characterized as unlawful and political censorship by 
        lawyers, political organizations, and students.
            (13) In the September 2016 election, Sixtus ``Baggio'' 
        Leung and Yau Wai-ching won seats in the Legislative Council 
        after running on platforms supportive of Hong Kong's democratic 
        self-determination. When swearing the oath of office in October 
        2016, both men altered the standard oath of office, after which 
        the Hong Kong government sued in an attempt to permanently 
        block them from retaking the oath.
            (14) In November 2016, with the court proceedings still 
        underway, the Chinese central government, on its own 
        initiative, issued an interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law, 
        thereby preventing these two democratically elected lawmakers 
        from taking their seats in the Legislative Council. The Hong 
        Kong Bar Association warned in advance that an intervention by 
        the Chinese government would ``deal a severe blow to the 
        independence of the judiciary and the power of final 
        adjudication of the Hong Kong court''.
            (15) Five individuals affiliated with the Mighty Current 
        Media publishing company and the Causeway Bay Bookstore, both 
        of which are based in Hong Kong and sell literary works 
        critical of Beijing, disappeared under mysterious circumstances 
        between October and December 2015, including Gui Minhai, a 
        naturalized Swedish citizen and co-owner of Mighty Current; Lee 
        Bo, a British citizen and co-owner of Mighty Current; Lui Bo; 
        Cheung Chi-ping; and Lam Wing-kee.
            (16) Upon his return to Hong Kong in June 2016, Lam 
        publicly revealed details of his and the other booksellers' 
        detentions, including their forced confessions, and alleged 
        that the abductions and detentions were directed by Chinese 
        central government officials.
            (17) Despite Lee's denial that he was abducted and the 
        televised confessions of the other four, the five men's 
        disappearances have been widely condemned by human rights 
        organizations and foreign officials and have resulted in 
        allegations of mainland China's law enforcement agencies 
        operating in Hong Kong, which would be a violation of the Basic 
        Law.
            (18) In February 2016, the British Foreign Secretary said 
        Lee Bo's involuntary removal to mainland China ``constitute[d] 
        a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration that 
        paved the way for Hong Kong's 1997 return to China. As part of 
        the treaty, China promised to safeguard Hong Kong's freedoms''.
            (19) As China's use of public ``confessions'' has expanded, 
        several Hong Kong media outlets have been the medium whereby 
        prominent rights defenders and lawyers, including Wang Yu and 
        Zhao Wei, have ``confessed'' to their alleged crimes.
            (20) The United States enjoys close economic, social, and 
        cultural ties with Hong Kong. According to the Department of 
        State, 60,000 United States citizens live in Hong Kong, and 
        1,400 United States businesses have offices there. According to 
        the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Hong Kong 
        is the United States 18th largest trade partner and 10th 
        largest export market for United States goods.
            (21) Hong Kong's unique status as an international finance 
        center where the rule of law and the rights and freedoms of its 
        citizens are protected has served as the foundation for Hong 
        Kong's stability and prosperity.
            (22) Section 301 of the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 
        U.S.C. 5731) required the Secretary of State to issue reports 
        on conditions in Hong Kong of interest to the United States, 
        including the development of democratic institutions in Hong 
        Kong, and the last report under section 301 was issued on June 
        30, 2007.
            (23) Failure to establish a genuine democratic option to 
        nominate and elect the Chief Executive of Hong Kong by 2017 and 
        to establish open and direct democratic elections for all 
        members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council by 2020 would 
        reduce confidence in the commitment of the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China to uphold its obligations under 
        international law, and would erode the ability of Hong Kong to 
        retain a high degree of autonomy.
            (24) During an October 2014 session, the United Nations 
        Human Rights Committee, consisting of 18 independent experts, 
        reviewed China's compliance with the International Covenant on 
        Civil and Political Rights with respect to Hong Kong. According 
        to the session's chair, the Committee agreed on ``the need to 
        ensure universal suffrage, which means both the right to be 
        elected as well as the right to vote. The main concerns of 
        Committee members were focused on the right to stand for 
        elections without unreasonable restrictions''. Another 
        Committee member said that the ``committee doesn't want 
        candidates filtered. The problem is that Beijing wants to vet 
        candidates''.
            (25) The Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2015 
        Annual Report ``observed developments raising concerns that the 
        Chinese and Hong Kong governments may have infringed on the 
        rights of the people of Hong Kong, including in the areas of 
        political participation and democratic reform, press freedom, 
        and freedom of assembly''.
            (26) The Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2016 
        Annual Report found that ``the growing influence of the Chinese 
        central government and communist party and suspected activity 
        by Chinese authorities in Hong Kong--notably the disappearance, 
        alleged abduction, and detention in mainland China of five Hong 
        Kong booksellers--raised fears regarding Hong Kong's autonomy 
        within China as guaranteed under the `one country, two systems' 
        policy enshrined in the Basic Law, which prohibits mainland 
        Chinese authorities from interfering in Hong Kong''.
            (27) A Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) survey on 
        press freedom found that 85 percent of journalists believed 
        press freedom had deteriorated in 2015.
            (28) Hong Kong ranked 69th among 180 countries in Reporters 
        Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index, down eight 
        places in just two years and marking a significant decline from 
        2002, when Hong Kong ranked 18th.
            (29) Freedom House's 2015 Freedom of the Press Report found 
        a five-year decline in press freedom in Hong Kong marked by an 
        increase in physical attacks against journalists, cyberattacks 
        crippling widely read news sites at politically sensitive 
        moments, and businesses withdrawing advertising from outlets 
        that were critical of Beijing and supportive of prodemocracy 
        protestors.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in 
        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, namely that--
                    (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in 
                the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of 
                Hong Kong'';
                    (B) ``support for democratization is a fundamental 
                principle of United States foreign policy'';
                    (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong 
                are of great importance to the United States and are 
                directly relevant to United States interests in Hong 
                Kong'';
                    (D) human rights ``serve as a basis for Hong Kong's 
                continued economic prosperity''; and
                    (E) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous 
                from the People's Republic of China to justify a 
                different treatment under a particular law of the 
                United States, or any provision thereof, from that 
                accorded the People's Republic of China;
            (2) to support the democratic aspirations of the people of 
        Hong Kong, as guaranteed to them by the Joint Declaration, the 
        Basic Law, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
            (3) to urge the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong, including 
        allowing the people of Hong Kong to rule Hong Kong with a high 
        degree of autonomy and without undue interference, and ensuring 
        that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right to elect the Chief 
        Executive and all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
        by universal suffrage;
            (4) to support the establishment by 2017 of a genuine 
        democratic option to freely and fairly nominate and elect the 
        Chief Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment by 2020 of 
        open and direct democratic elections for all members of the 
        Hong Kong Legislative Council;
            (5) to support the robust exercise by residents of Hong 
        Kong of the rights to free speech and the press as guaranteed 
        to them by the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration;
            (6) to ensure that all residents of Hong Kong are afforded 
        freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention, or 
        imprisonment as guaranteed to them by the Basic Law and the 
        Joint Declaration; and
            (7) to draw international attention to any violations by 
        the Government of the People's Republic of China of the 
        fundamental rights of residents of Hong Kong and any 
        encroachment upon the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong by the 
        Basic Law and the Joint Declaration.
