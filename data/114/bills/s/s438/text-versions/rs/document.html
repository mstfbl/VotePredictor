needs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Priority.--In allocating amounts under section 201(b), 
in addition to considering the funding priorities described in section

        in paragraph (1), if the full amount under section 201(b) 
        cannot be fully allocated to eligible Indian irrigation 
        projects because the costs of the remaining activities 
        authorized in section 201(b) of an irrigation project would 
        exceed the cap described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may 
        allocate the remaining funds to eligible Indian irrigation 
        projects in accordance with this title.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

2016 through 2037, each Indian irrigation project eligible for funding 
under section 202 that has critical maintenance needs receives part of 
the funding under section 201 to address critical maintenance needs.
    (b) Priority.--In allocating amounts under section 201(b), in 
addition to considering the funding priorities described in section 
203, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible Indian irrigation 
projects serving more than 1 Indian tribe within an Indian reservation

        paragraph (1), if the full amount under section 201(b) cannot 
        be fully allocated to eligible Indian irrigation projects 
        because the costs of the remaining activities authorized in 
        section 201(b) of an irrigation project would exceed the cap 
        described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may allocate the 
        remaining funds to eligible Indian irrigation projects in 
        accordance with this title.
