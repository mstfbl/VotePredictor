                                 A BILL


 
To incentivize State support for postsecondary education and to promote 
 increased access and affordability for higher education for students, 
                      including Dreamer students.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in States to Achieve 
Tuition Equality for Dreamers Act of 2015'' or the ``IN-STATE for 
Dreamers Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that 
        comprehensive immigration reform would reduce the national 
        deficit by billions, strengthen Social Security solvency, 
        increase the number of jobs, and raise Gross Domestic Product.
            (2) According to a report by the Partnership for a New 
        American Economy, more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies 
        were founded by immigrants or their children, generating a 
        combined revenue of $4,200,000,000,000.
            (3) Thousands of deferred action childhood arrival students 
        graduate from high schools in the United States every year but 
        only a small fraction of those students enroll in higher 
        education.
            (4) Many jobs in the 21st century economy require some form 
        of postsecondary education.
            (5) Education provides an important pathway to the middle 
        class; college graduates have higher earnings and lower 
        unemployment rates than their less educated peers.
            (6) Since 2008, States are spending 28 percent less per 
        student in higher education, and tuition and fees continue to 
        rise. The increased costs are being shifted to students and 
        student loan debt continues to grow.
            (7) Investments in higher education provide youth a ladder 
        to achieving the American dream.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) allow States to provide immigrant students timely and 
        affordable access to higher education;
            (2) incentivize States to maintain support for higher 
        education; and
            (3) promote increased access and affordability to 
        postsecondary education for students through State need-based 
        financial aid.
