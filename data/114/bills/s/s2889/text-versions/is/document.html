    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Innovators and 
Entrepreneurs Act''.

SEC. 2. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION'S INNOVATION CORPS.

    The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2010 (Public 
Law 111-358; 124 Stat. 4005) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``SEC. 528. INNOVATION CORPS.

    ``(a) Finding.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps 
        (referred to in this section as the `I-Corps') was established 
        by Executive authority to foster a national innovation 
        ecosystem by encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, 
        and entrepreneurs to identify and explore the innovation and 
        commercial potential of Foundation-funded research well beyond 
        the laboratory.
            ``(2) The I-Corps includes investments in entrepreneurship 
        and commercialization education, training, and mentoring, 
        ultimately leading to the practical deployment of technologies, 
        products, processes, and services that improve the Nation's 
        competitiveness, promote economic growth, and benefit society.
            ``(3) By building networks of entrepreneurs, educators, 
        mentors, institutions, and collaborations, and supporting 
        specialized education and training, I-Corps is at the leading 
        edge of a strong, lasting foundation for an American innovation 
        ecosystem.
            ``(4) By translating federally funded research to a 
        commercial stage more quickly and efficiently, programs like 
        the I-Corps create new jobs and companies, help solve societal 
        problems, and provide taxpayers with a greater return on their 
        investment in research.
            ``(5) The I-Corps program model has a strong record of 
        success that should be replicated at all Federal research 
        agencies.
            ``(6) Federal funding of Nodes, Sites, Teams, and 
        leadership and control of curriculum by the National Science 
        Foundation and other participating agencies are essential parts 
        of the I-Corps program.
            ``(7) The success of the I-Corps program requires 
        opportunities for both on-line and in-person access to the I-
        Corps curriculum.
    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Node.--The term `Node' means a center for 
        entrepreneurial education that--
                    ``(A) supports regional and national needs for 
                innovation education, infrastructure, and research; and
                    ``(B) serves as a location for delivery of the I-
                Corps curriculum.
            ``(2) Site.--The term `Site' means a center for

                student, or postdoctoral fellow;
                    ``(B) at least one professor or research scientist; 
                and
                    ``(C) at least one person experienced in
