        such action would be contrary to the fundamental principles on 
        which this Nation was founded; and
            (2) the individual right of the American people to keep and 
        bear arms, as recognized by the Second Amendment to the 
        Constitution of the United States, as incorporated by the 
        Fourteenth Amendment to the States, and as interpreted by the 
        Supreme Court of the United States in District of Columbia v. 
        Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, is among those fundamental 
        rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty and deeply 
        rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, such that any 
        violation of this precious right would be contrary to the 
        fundamental principles upon which this Nation was founded.
