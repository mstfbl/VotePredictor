                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 54, United States Code, to establish within the National 
  Park Service the U.S. Civil Rights Network, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``U.S. Civil Rights Network 
Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the African American civil rights movement 
        includes historic events, court decisions, and legislation, the 
        goals of which were--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) to end segregation based on 
                race;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to end discrimination against African 
                Americans; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) to ensure that African American 
                citizens could exercise their basic constitutional 
                rights, including the right to vote;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the civil rights movement--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) helped bridge the divides of race, 
                religion, sectional differences, and 
                nationality;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) spanned State lines; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) joined the ideals of liberty and 
                freedom expressed in the Declaration of Independence, 
                the Constitution, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
                U.S.C. 2000a et seq.) to the extraordinary actions of 
                ordinary men and women working in common purpose for 
                equal rights;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the National Park Service and Organization of 
        American Historians conducted a theme study that identified and 
        interpreted sites related to the Civil Rights movement in 
        accordance with the National Park Service Studies Act of 1999 
        (as enacted in title III of Appendix C of Public Law 106-113; 
        113 Stat. 1501A-194);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) in conducting the theme study referred to in 
        paragraph (3), the National Park Service and Organization of 
        American Historians found that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) although many sites relating to the 
                African American civil rights movement have been 
                identified and recognized in existing National Park 
                System units--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) a number of sites relating to 
                        the African American civil rights movement have 
                        not been recognized;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) many sites relating to the 
                        African American civil rights movement are in 
                        imminent danger of being lost or destroyed; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) many important resource 
                        types relating to the African American civil 
                        rights movement are not adequately represented 
                        and protected;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) there are many important sites 
                relating to the African American civil rights movement 
                that have high potential for preservation and visitor 
                use in a number of States, the District of Columbia, 
                and territories of the United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) no single site completely reflects and 
                characterizes the African American civil rights 
                movement, since the story of, and resources associated 
                with, the African American civil rights movement 
                involve networks, regions, and territories of the 
                United States rather than individual sites; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) the establishment of a variety of 
                partnerships among the Federal Government, State, and 
                units of local government, and the private sector would 
                be most appropriate for the protection, restoration, 
                and interpretation of the U.S. Civil Rights 
                Network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the National Park Service can play a vital 
        role in facilitating the creation and sustained success of the 
        U.S. Civil Rights Network; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the story and significance of the African 
        American civil rights movement can best engage the people of 
        the United States through a national program of the National 
        Park Service that links, in a unified and flexible manner--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) historic buildings, structures, and 
                sites relating to the African American civil rights 
                movement;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) geographic areas relating to the 
                African American civil rights movement;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) interpretive centers, museums, and 
                institutions relating to the African American civil 
                rights movement; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) programs, activities, community 
                projects, exhibits, and multimedia materials relating 
                to the African American civil rights 
                movement.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to recognize--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the importance of the African American 
                civil rights movement; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the sacrifices made by the people who 
                fought against discrimination and segregation; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to authorize the National Park Service to 
        coordinate and facilitate Federal and non-Federal activities to 
        commemorate, honor, and interpret--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the history of the African American 
                civil rights movement;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the significance of the civil rights 
                movement as a crucial element in the evolution of the 
                Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.); 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the relevance of the African American 
                civil rights movement in fostering the spirit of social 
                justice and national reconciliation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
