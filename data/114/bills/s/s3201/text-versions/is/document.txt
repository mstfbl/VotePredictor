                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit certain practices relating to certain commodity promotion 
 programs, to require greater transparency by those programs, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Commodity Checkoff Program 
Improvement Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the generic programs to promote and provide research 
        and information for an agricultural commodity (commonly known 
        as ``checkoff programs'') are intended to increase demand for 
        all of that agricultural commodity and benefit all assessed 
        producers of that agricultural commodity;
            (2) although the laws establishing checkoff programs 
        broadly prohibit the use of funds in any manner for the purpose 
        of influencing legislation or government action, checkoff 
        programs have repeatedly been shown to use funds to influence 
        policy directly or by partnering with organizations that lobby;
            (3) the unlawful use of checkoff programs funds benefits 
        some agricultural producers while harming many others;
            (4) to more effectively prevent Boards from using funds for 
        unlawful purposes, strict separation of engagement between the 
        Boards and policy entities is necessary;
            (5) conflicts of interest in the checkoff programs allow 
        special interests to use checkoff program funds for the benefit 
        of some assessed agricultural producers at the expense of many 
        others;
            (6) prohibiting conflicts of interest in checkoff programs 
        is necessary to ensure the proper and lawful operation of the 
        checkoff programs;
            (7) checkoff programs are designed to promote agricultural 
        commodities, not to damage other types of agricultural 
        commodities through anticompetitive conduct or otherwise;
            (8) prohibiting anticompetitive and similar conduct is 
        necessary to ensure proper and lawful operation of checkoff 
        programs;
            (9) lack of transparency in checkoff programs enables 
        abuses to occur and conceals abuses from being discovered; and
            (10) requiring transparency in the expenditure of checkoff 
        program funds is necessary to prevent and uncover abuses in 
        checkoff programs.
