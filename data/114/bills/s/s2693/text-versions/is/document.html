_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To ensure the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission allocates its 
 resources appropriately by prioritizing complaints of discrimination 
 before implementing the proposed revision of the employer information 
                 report EEO-1, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``EEOC Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSED REVISION OF 
              EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The current employer information report EEO-1 requires 
        most employers with 100 or more employees to annually submit 
        employment data for its workforce, categorized by race/
        ethnicity, gender, and job category, for a total of 180 
        combinations of data collected. The proposed EEO-1 report 
        expands the data collection to include employee income and 
        hours worked, for a total of 3,660 combinations of data 
        collected. This is an increase in data collection of 1,933 
        percent.
            (2) The primary purpose of chapter 35 of title 44, United 
        States Code (commonly known as the ``Paperwork Reduction Act'') 
        is to ``minimize the paperwork burden . . . for persons 
        resulting from the collecting of information by or for the 
        Federal Government''. The staggering increase of data proposed 
        to be collected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
        through the proposed revision of the EEO-1 report does not 
        comport with that stated purpose of the Paperwork Reduction 
        Act.
            (3) The Commission failed to provide a detailed explanation 
        of how the Commission will track, verify, compile, ensure 
        confidentiality of, and protect the new information, and how 
        the Commission will use that information in enforcement 
        efforts.
            (4) At the end of fiscal year 2015, the Commission had a 
        pending inventory of 76,408 charges of discrimination. During 
        fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the Commission resolved the fewest 
        number of charges since 2010, even though the charge receipts 
        remained stable or declined during that time period.
            (5) The Commission reported that in 2015, ``37.6 percent of 
        EEOC staff expressed concern that their workload is not 
        reasonable, substantially higher than the government-wide 
        average of 26.5 percent''. If the Commission implements the 
        proposed revision of the EEO-1 report, resources and staff that 
        should be dedicated to reducing the pending inventory of 
        charges of discrimination may be used for reviewing the 
        increased data collected through the proposed EEO-1 report, 
        instead of working to resolve such charges and reduce the 
        backlog of such charges.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Equal 
        Employment Opportunity Commission.
            (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' has the meaning 
        given the term ``Executive department'' in section 101 of title 
        5, United States Code.
            (3) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means an 
        independent establishment described in section 104(1) of title 
        5, United States Code.
            (4) Proposed report revision.--The term ``proposed report 
        revision'' means the proposed revision of the employer 
        information report EEO-1 set forth in the notice entitled 
        ``Agency Information Collection Activities: Revision of the 
        Employer Information Report (EEO-1) and Comment Request'' (81 
        Fed. Reg. 5113 (February 1, 2016)).
            (5) Revised employer information report.--The term 
        ``revised employer information report'' means the employer 
        information report EEO-1, after the proposed report revision.
    (c) Data Collection and Report.--
            (1) Limitation on implementation.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commission may not implement 
                the proposed report revision until the date on which 
                the Commission obtains approval of the related 
                collection of information, at the end of the process 
                described in paragraph (5), and meets the requirements 
                of subsection (d)(2).
                    (B) Prior implementation.--If the Commission 
                implements the proposed report revision before the date 
                of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall cease 
                that implementation on that date and may not resume 
                that implementation or use the data collected from the 
                revised employer information report in its enforcement 
                efforts until the date described in subparagraph (A).
            (2) Data collection.--The Commission shall--
                    (A) on an annual basis--
                            (i) collect information from each head of a 
                        Department or Federal agency (referred to in 
                        this paragraph as the ``Federal employee 
                        information'') that is the same type of 
                        employment data information as a private sector 
                        employer with 100 or more employees would be 
                        required to collect under the revised employer 
                        information report;
                            (ii) verify, compile, ensure the 
                        confidentiality of, and protect the collected 
                        Federal employee information; and
                            (iii) publish, and make publicly available, 
                        the compiled Federal employee information in 
                        the aggregate, and analyzed by each Department 
                        or Federal agency;
                    (B) on an annual basis--
                            (i) collect and compile information 
                        (referred to in this paragraph as the 
                        ``Commission information'') on the number of 
                        employees and employee hours required to carry 
                        out subparagraph (A), the number of employees 
                        and employee hours that were transferred from 
                        reducing the number of pending charges of 
                        discrimination before the Commission to carry 
                        out subparagraph (A), and the cost of carrying 
                        out subparagraph (A); and
                            (ii) publish, and make publicly available,

                    (C) on an annual basis--
                            (i) using the information obtained under 
                        subparagraph (B), calculate the number of 
                        Commission employees and employee hours that 
                        will be required for, and the cost of, 
                        tracking, verifying, compiling, ensuring 
                        confidentiality of, and protecting the

                        charges before the Commission, to carry out 
                        such tracking, verification, compiling, 
                        ensuring confidentiality, protection, and

                        information collected for the revised employer 
                        information report, including a detailed, 
                        comprehensive policy with specific examples 
                        regarding how the Commission will--

                reduces its inventory of pending charges to not more 
                than 3,660.
                    (B) Prior implementation.--If the Commission 
                implements the proposed report revision before the date 
                of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall cease 
                that implementation on that date and may not resume 
                that implementation or use the data collected from the 
                revised employer information report in its enforcement 
                efforts until the Commission reduces its inventory as 
                described in subparagraph (A).

                        delegation, the basis on which the General 
                        Counsel determined that submission to the

                        appeal.

                Commissioner charge authority under section 706(b) of 
                the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(b)) and
