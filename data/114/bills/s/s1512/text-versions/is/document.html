  To eliminate discrimination and promote women's health and economic 
 security by ensuring reasonable workplace accommodations for workers 
    whose ability to perform the functions of a job are limited by 
         pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pregnant Workers Fairness Act''.

SEC. 2. NONDISCRIMINATION WITH REGARD TO REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 
              RELATED TO PREGNANCY.

    It shall be an unlawful employment practice for a covered entity 
to--
            (1) not make reasonable accommodations to the known 
        limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
        medical conditions of a job applicant or employee, unless such 
        covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would 
        impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of 
        such covered entity;
            (2) deny employment opportunities to a job applicant or 
        employee, if such denial is based on the need of the covered 
        entity to make reasonable accommodations to the known 
        limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
        medical conditions of an employee or applicant;
            (3) require a job applicant or employee affected by 
        pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions to accept 
        an accommodation that such applicant or employee chooses not to 
        accept, if such accommodation is unnecessary to enable the 
        applicant or employee to perform her job;
            (4) require an employee to take leave, whether paid or 
        unpaid, if another reasonable accommodation can be provided to 
        the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or 
        related medical conditions of an employee; or
            (5) take adverse action in terms, conditions, or privileges 
        of employment against an employee on account of the employee 
        requesting or using a reasonable accommodation to the known 
        limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
        medical conditions of the employee.
