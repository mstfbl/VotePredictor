SEC. 101. ESTABLISHMENT OF WORKING GROUP.

    There is established in the Administration for Children and

shall be known as the Federal Interagency Working Group on Reducing 
Child Poverty (in this Act referred to as the ``Working Group'').

SEC. 102. NATIONAL PLAN TO REDUCE CHILD POVERTY.

    (a) Primary Goal.--
            (1) Development of national plan.--The primary goal of the 
        Working Group is to develop a national plan--
                    (A) to reduce, within 10 years after the date on 
                which funding is made available to carry out this Act--
                            (i) the number of children living in 
                        poverty in the United States to half of the 
                        number of such children as reported in the 
                        report of the United States Census Bureau on 
                        Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage 
                        in the United States: 2014 (issued in September 
                        2015); and
                            (ii) the number of children living in 
                        extreme poverty in the United States to zero; 
                        and
                    (B) to reduce, within 20 years after the date on 
                which funds are made available to carry out this Act, 
                the number of children living in poverty in the United 
                States to zero.
            (2) Consultation with national academy of sciences.--In 
        developing the national plan under paragraph (1), the Working 
        Group shall consider all recommendations, research papers, and 
        reports published by the National Academy of Sciences as a 
        result of the workshops conducted pursuant to title II.
            (3) Deadline.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Working Group shall make 
        substantial progress toward the development of the national 
        plan.
    (b) Additional Goals.--The national plan under subsection (a) shall 
include recommendations for achieving the following goals:
            (1) Understanding the root causes of child poverty, 
        including persistent intergenerational poverty, taking into 
        account social, economic, and cultural factors.
            (2) Improving the accessibility of anti-poverty programs 
        and increasing the rate of enrollment in such programs among 
        eligible children and families by reducing the complexity and 
        difficulty of enrolling in such programs.
            (3) Eliminating disparate rates of child poverty based on 
        race, ethnicity, gender, and age.
            (4) Improving the ability of individuals living in poverty, 
        low-income individuals, and unemployed individuals to access 
        quality jobs that help children and their families rise above 
        poverty.
            (5) Connecting low-income children, disconnected youth, and 
        their families to education, job training, work, and their 
        communities.
            (6) Shifting the measures and policies of Federal anti-
        poverty programs from the goal of helping individuals and 
        families living in poverty to achieve freedom from deprivation 
        toward the goal of helping such individuals and families rise 
        above poverty and achieve long-term economic stability.
    (c) Methods.--In developing the national plan under subsection (a), 
the Working Group shall employ methods for achieving the goals 
described in subsections (a) and (b) that include--
            (1) entering into an agreement with the National Academy of 
        Sciences for a workshop series on the economic and social costs 
        of child poverty, as described in title II;
            (2) studying the effect of child poverty on the health and 
        welfare of children, including the access of children living in 
        poverty to health care, housing, proper nutrition, and 
        education;
            (3) measuring the effect of child poverty on the ability of 
        individuals to achieve economic stability, including such 
        effect on educational attainment, rates of incarceration, 
        lifetime earnings, access to healthcare, and access to housing;
            (4) updating and applying improved measures of poverty that 
        can meaningfully account for other aspects relating to the 
        measure of poverty, such as the Supplemental Poverty Measure 
        used by the United States Census Bureau; and
            (5) using and applying fact-based measures to evaluate the 
        long-term effectiveness of anti-poverty programs, taking into 
        account the long-term savings and value to the Federal 
        Government and to State, local, and tribal governments of 
        practices and policies designed to prevent poverty.

        activities, and services related to child welfare and child
