                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow all eligible voters 
   to vote by mail in Federal elections, to amend the National Voter 
 Registration Act of 1993 to provide for automatic voter registration.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Vote By Mail Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United 
        States because voters in some States have the universal right 
        to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.
            (2) Many voters often have work, family, or other 
        commitments that make getting to polls and waiting in line on 
        the date of an election difficult or impossible. Many citizens 
        with disabilities are physically unable to vote due to long 
        lines, inadequate parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large 
        crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabilities had 
        difficulty voting, and more than 5,000,000 voters waited more 
        than an hour to vote. Under current State laws, many of these 
        voters are not permitted to vote by mail.
            (3) Twenty-eight States currently allow universal absentee 
        voting (also known as ``no-excuse'' absentee voting), which 
        permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing 
        a reason for the request. No State which has implemented no-
        excuse absentee voting has repealed it.
            (4) Three States currently hold elections entirely by mail. 
        Twenty-two States currently allow some elections to be 
        conducted by mail, especially in large and rural jurisdictions 
        where voting by mail is especially convenient. Polling stations 
        in rural jurisdictions tend to have higher costs per voter, 
        smaller staffs, and limited resources. Transportation is often 
        a crucial barrier for rural voters.
            (5) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their 
        choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain 
        greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the 
        past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum 
        process in many States.
            (6) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the State of 
        Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters in 1996, the cost to 
        administer an election in the State dropped by nearly 30 
        percent over the next few elections, from $3.07 per voter to 
        $2.21 per voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting 
        in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an average of 
        40 percent. The cost of conducting vote-by-mail elections is 
        generally one-third to one-half less than conducting polling 
        place elections. Voting by mail also saves a substantial amount 
        by getting rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll 
        workers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have been 
        facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of poll 
        workers.
            (7) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can 
        reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the 
        polls. In 2016, voters in Arizona reported waiting in line from 
        1 to 5 hours to vote; in New York, voters reported that 
        stations ran out of ballots and did not have staff during all 
        of the hours scheduled for voting.
            (8) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an 
        alternative to going to the polls. In 2012, 19 percent of 
        ballots in the United States were cast by mail, up from 10 
        percent in 2000. Voting by mail has become increasingly popular 
        with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote 
        no matter what comes up on election day, as it reduces the 
        physical obstacles and eases the time constraints connected 
        with the act of voting.
            (9) The signature verification process, the tracking system 
        for each ballot, and postal service cooperation in preventing 
        ballots from being delivered to names not recognized as 
        receiving mail at an address nearly eliminate the potential for 
        fraud in vote-by-mail elections. Evidence of undue influence or 
        voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementation in Oregon has 
        been nonexistent to minimal.
            (10) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are 
        required to provide in order to vote by mail require the 
        revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, 
        or religious activities, which violate voters' privacy while 
        doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.
            (11) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary 
        signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to 
        voters without increasing security.
            (12) Many voters choose to cast ballots early when they 
        have the option (over 40 percent in Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, 
        and Tennessee). Nearly one-third of voters in the 2012 election 
        cast their ballot before election day, which is about double 
        the rate of voters in 2000. In Oregon, 7 years after vote-by-
        mail election implementation, over 80 percent of voters favored 
        the vote-by-mail system.
            (13) Voting by mail typically increases turnout in all 
        elections, but can be particularly effective in increasing 
        voter participation in special elections and primary elections. 
        Oregon and Washington, the 2 States with the longest standing 
        vote-by-mail systems, continue to have consistently high voter 
        turnout rates. In the 2012 primary elections, while the 
        national average turnout was 18 percent, Oregon's was 45 
        percent and Washington's was 38 percent.
            (14) A crucial component of a modern voting system is 
        making it easy, affordable, and accessible to register to vote. 
        Eighteen States and the District of Columbia introduced 
        automatic voter registration legislation in 2015, and Oregon 
        and California now automatically register their citizens to 
        vote when they apply for a driver's license. Automatic, 
        permanent voter registration has the potential to increase 
        participation, protect election integrity, and reduce 
        registration costs.
