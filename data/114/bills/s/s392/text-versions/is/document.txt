                                 A BILL


 
 To combat heroin and methamphetamine trafficking across the Southern 
          border of the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Drugs at the Border Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

            (1) According to United States Border Patrol statistics, 
        seizures of heroin and methamphetamine by border patrol agents 
        along the Southwest border are increasing.
            (2) Between fiscal year 2011 and fiscal year 2014, the 
        number of heroin seizures at the Southwest border of the United 
        States increased from 85 to 145, a 71 percent increase. The 
        volume of heroin seized increased from 6,191 ounces in fiscal 
        year 2011 to 9,205 ounces in fiscal year 2014, a 49 percent 
        increase.
            (3) The number of methamphetamine seizures at the Southwest 
        border of the United States increased from 437 in fiscal year 
        2011 to 724 in fiscal year 2014, a 66 percent increase. 
        Likewise, the amount of methamphetamine seized at such 
        Southwest border increased by 105 percent, from 1,838 pounds in 
        fiscal year 2011 to 3,771 pounds in fiscal year 2014.
            (4) Similarly, the Drug Enforcement Administration reported 
        that total heroin seizure volume along the Southwest border of 
        the United States has nearly tripled since 2009, and the total 
        volume of methamphetamine seized has quintupled.
            (5) According to the 2014 National Drug Threat Assessment 
        Summary of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the threat 
        posed by heroin use is increasing across the country, 
        particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. As this threat 
        increases, the Administration finds that seizures at the 
        Southwest border are rising as Mexican transnational criminal 
        organizations increase heroin production and transportation.
            (6) Heroin overdose deaths continue to rise. According to 
        the Centers for Disease Control, deaths linked to heroin 
        overdoses increased 39 percent between 2012 and 2013. A total 
        of 8,257 people died due to heroin use in 2013, up from 5,925 
        in 2012.
            (7) Although progress has been made to decrease the 
        prevalence of methamphetamine use in the United States, with 
        the number of past month users of methamphetamine declining 40 
        percent since 2006, availability indicators suggest the supply 
        of Mexican methamphetamine is increasing in the United States.
            (8) The 2014 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary of the 
        Drug Enforcement Administration indicates that higher levels of 
        methamphetamine availability in the United States are directly 
        related to high levels of methamphetamine production in Mexico. 
        The Administration finds that the majority of methamphetamine 
        available in the United States is produced in Mexico.

SEC. 3. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY STRATEGY AND PLAN.

    The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in

partners to respond to increased heroin and methamphetamine trafficking 
occurring along the international border between the United States and

            (1) a description of any new technology, equipment, 
        personnel, or other resources the head of U.S. Customs and

        heroin and methamphetamine trafficking occurring along the 
        international border between the United States and Mexico; and
            (2) an estimate of the funding required to enable U.S. 
        Customs and Border Protection to respond to such trafficking.
