                                 A BILL


 
  To require an Air Force report on perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and 
  perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) contamination at certain military 
installations and require reparation for identified contaminated sites 
                          and affected areas.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AIR FORCE REPORT ON PERFLUOROOCTANOIC ACID (PFOA) AND 
              PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATES (PFOS) CONTAMINATION AT 
              CERTAIN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An increasing number of communities across New York 
        have reportedly identified the presence of perfluorooctanoic 
        acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), which can 
        contaminate water and cause adverse health effects.
            (2) According to reports, levels of PFOA and PFOS have been 
        detected in the public and private water supplies in the cities 
        of Newburgh and Plattsburgh and the towns of Hoosick Falls and 
        Petersburgh, New York. Public and private wells in these 
        communities are being tested by the New York Department of 
        Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the New York Department of 
        Health (DOH).
            (3) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has 
        identified PFOA as an ``emerging contaminant'', and in 2009, 
        the EPA issued an updated provisional health advisory for 
        drinking water of 70 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force, in 
        collaboration with the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, shall submit to Congress a report on 
        perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonates 
        (PFOS) contamination at Stewart Air National Guard Base, 
        Newburgh, Plattsburgh, Hoosick Falls, and Petersburgh, New 
        York, and any other sites the Secretary determines appropriate.
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include the following elements:
                    (A) An accelerated timeline and status on the 
                inspection and cleanup at Stewart Air National Guard 
                Base, Newburgh, Plattsburgh, Hoosick Falls, and 
                Petersburgh, New York.
                    (B) An update on the Air Force's efforts to 
                identify and notify everyone potentially affected or 
                impacted by the contamination.
                    (C) An assessment of the Air Force's role, if any, 
                in the new contaminations.
                    (D) A summary of the Air Force's support, where 
                appropriate, for the EPA with respect to the latest 
                contaminations.
                    (E) A detailed proposal mandating the financial 
                compensation and reimbursement for cleanup, water 
                accessibility interim programs, and water source 
                filtration initiatives in the event the Air Force is 
                responsible for the contamination pursuant to the 
                Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
                Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
