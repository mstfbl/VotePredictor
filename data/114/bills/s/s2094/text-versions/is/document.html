        designation as a foreign terrorist organization as set forth in 
        section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1189); and

            (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date

                    (A) a detailed report on whether Iran's 
                Revolutionary Guard Corps meets the criteria for 
                designation as a foreign terrorist organization as set 
                forth in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
                    (B) if the Secretary determines that Iran's 
                Revolutionary Guard Corps does not meet the criteria 
                set forth under such section 219, a detailed 
                justification as to which criteria have not been met.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall--

                    (B) be made available only in electronic form and 
                shall not be printed, except if a printed copy is
