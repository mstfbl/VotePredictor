                State offices are open) have elapsed since the licensee 
                contacted the system, and the system has not notified 
                the licensee that the receipt of a firearm by such 
                other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of 
                this section; and
            ``(ii) in the case of a transferee who is an alien who 
        entered the United States pursuant to the program established

investigation described in this paragraph is an investigation that 
includes a check of records maintained by the International Criminal 
Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the country that issued the alien's 
passport in order to determine whether the receipt of a firearm by the 
alien would violate subsection (g) or (n), and a foreign conviction 
shall be considered a conviction under subsection (g)(1).''.
