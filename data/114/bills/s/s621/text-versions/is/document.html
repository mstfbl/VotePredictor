SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING VETERINARY OVERSIGHT OF USE OF 
              MEDICALLY IMPORTANT ANTIMICROBIALS.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of the Senate that a valid 
veterinarian-client-patient relationship should exist to ensure that 
medically important antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals 
in a manner that is consistent with professionally accepted best 
practices.
    (b) Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship.--In this section, the 
term ``veterinarian-client-patient relationship'' means a relationship 
in which all of the following criteria are met:
            (1) The veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for 
        making medical judgments regarding the health of the patient 
        and the client has agreed to follow the veterinarian's 
        instructions.
            (2) The veterinarian has sufficient knowledge of the 
        patient to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis 
        of the medical condition of the patient. This means that the 
        veterinarian is personally acquainted with the keeping and care 
        of the patient by virtue of--
                    (A) a timely examination of the patient by the 
                veterinarian; or
                    (B) medically appropriate and timely visits by the 
                veterinarian to the premises where the animal or 
                animals are kept.
            (3) The veterinarian is readily available for follow-up 
        evaluation or has arranged for veterinary emergency coverage 
        and continuing care and treatment.
            (4) The veterinarian provides oversight of treatment, 
        compliance, and outcome.
            (5) Patient records are maintained.
