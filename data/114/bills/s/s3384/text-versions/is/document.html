_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a credit for 
             middle-income housing, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX 
              CREDIT.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is one of the Federal 
        Government's primary policy tools for encouraging the 
        development and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
            (2) Since 1986, when the low-income housing tax credit was 
        first enacted, the credit has financed about 2,800,000 
        affordable homes in the United States for roughly 6,500,000 
        households. In Oregon, the program has financed over 37,000 
        affordable homes, providing housing to over 85,000 low-income 
        households.
            (3) While the low-income housing tax credit has been 
        remarkably successful, the Nation still faces an affordable 
        housing crisis. Today, more than 1 in 4 renter households in 
        the United States--roughly 11,400,000--spend more than half of 
        their income on rent, leaving too little for other necessities 
        like food, medical care, and transportation. Meanwhile, only 1 
        in 4 eligible low-income households receives any housing 
        assistance, and we continue to lose affordable housing from our 
        Nation's stock.
            (4) In Oregon, where housing affordability is an acute 
        problem, demand for low-income housing tax credits exceeds 
        supply by 3 to 1.
            (5) In July of 2016, the Affordable Housing Credit 
        Improvement Act of 2016 was introduced to expand and strengthen 
        the low-income housing tax credit. To provide States with 
        further tools to encourage the development of greatly needed 
        additional affordable housing, the Affordable Housing Credit 
        Improvement Act of 2016 would increase the annual per capita 
        low income housing tax credit allocation and small State 
        minimum by 50 percent phased in over 5 years.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) The low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is a critically important 
        Federal Government policy tool to encourage the production of 
        affordable housing for low-income families; and
            (2) Congress should further improve and enhance the low-
        income housing tax credit by passing the Affordable Housing 
        Credit Improvement Act of 2016.

SEC. 3. MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT.

    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after 
section 42 the following new section:

``SEC. 42A. MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT.

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of section 38, the amount of the 
middle-income housing credit determined under this section for any 
taxable year in the credit period shall be an amount equal to--
            ``(1) the applicable percentage of
            ``(2) the qualified basis of each qualified middle-income 
        building.
    ``(b) Applicable Percentage.--
            ``(1) Determination of applicable percentage.--For purposes 
        of this section--

                means, with respect to any building, the appropriate 
                percentage prescribed by the Secretary for the earlier 
                of--

                        month in which the taxpayer and the housing

                election is made not later than the 5th day after the 
                close of such month. Such an election, once made, shall 
                be irrevocable.

                percentages prescribed by the Secretary for any month 
                shall be percentages which will yield over a 15-year

                have a present value equal to 50 percent of the 
                qualified basis of a new building.
