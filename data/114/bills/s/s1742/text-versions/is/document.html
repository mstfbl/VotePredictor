                    (A) an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
                business model of the Postal Service for protecting 
                rural postal services as of the date on which the

                    (B) an assessment of potential future business 
                models for the Postal Service and the impact of those

                continue to offer postal services in rural areas;

                standards for, and meet the needs of postal customers 
                in, rural areas; and

SEC. 9. EQUIPPING DELIVERY VEHICLES FOR RURAL AREAS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) while it may be too late for the Postal Service to 
        consider rural mail delivery as part of its Next Generation 
        Delivery Vehicles (commonly known as ``NGDV'') initiative, the 
        Postal Service should consider options for a rural delivery 
        truck prototype in the future, as rural letter carriers 
        currently must use their own vehicles due to the unique terrain 
        challenges across the United States; and
            (2) the Postal Service should consider the feasibility of 
        equipping delivery vehicles that can not only handle the 
        challenges described in paragraph (1), but can also handle 
        severe weather conditions.
    (b) GAO Study.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall--
            (1) study the feasibility of the Postal Service designing 
        mail delivery vehicles that are equipped for rural areas; and
            (2) submit to Congress a report on the findings of the 
        study conducted under paragraph (1).

SEC. 10. WI-FI IN RURAL POST OFFICES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) because post offices still serve as a central point in 
        many rural communities where people congregate and connect with 
        the rest of the world, the Postal Service should consider 
        providing wireless broadband Internet access service at all 
        rural post offices as a method of incentivizing individuals to 
        use their community post office as much as possible; and
            (2) because of the challenges that implementing wireless 
        broadband Internet access service at all rural post offices 
        would pose, the Postal Service should first consider 
        implementing a pilot program under which the Postal Service 
        would provide wireless broadband Internet access service at 4 
        rural post offices in diverse areas of the United States for a 
        2-year period in order to determine whether the addition of 
        such service in those post offices has an impact on the amount 
        of business or revenue generated by each post office.
    (b) GAO Study.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall--
            (1) study the feasibility of the Postal Service providing 
        wireless broadband Internet access service at all rural post 
        offices; and
            (2) submit to Congress a report on the findings of the 
        study conducted under paragraph (1).

SEC. 11. PROTECTION OF DOOR AND CURBSIDE DELIVERY.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``centralized delivery'' means a primary mode 
        of mail delivery whereby mail is delivered to a group or 
        cluster of mail receptacles at a single location;
            (2) the term ``curbside delivery'' means a primary mode of 
        mail delivery whereby mail is delivered to a mail receptacle 
        that is situated at the edge of a public sidewalk abutting a 
        road or curb, at a road, or at a curb;
            (3) the term ``delivery point'' means a mailbox or other 
        receptacle to which mail is delivered;
            (4) the term ``door delivery''--
                    (A) means a primary mode of mail delivery whereby 
                mail is--
                            (i) delivered to a mail receptacle at or 
                        near a postal customer's door; or
                            (ii) hand-delivered to a postal customer; 
                        and
                    (B) does not include curbside or centralized 
                delivery; and
            (5) the term ``primary mode of mail delivery'' means the 
        typical method by which the Postal Service delivers mail to the 
        delivery point of a postal customer.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Postal 
Service should not convert existing residential or business addresses 
to centralized delivery from door delivery or curbside delivery.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
