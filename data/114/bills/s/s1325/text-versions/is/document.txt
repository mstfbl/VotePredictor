                                 A BILL


 
    To designate the Department of Veterans Affairs community based 
outpatient clinic in Newark, Ohio, as the Daniel L. Kinnard Department 
         of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Daniel L. Kinnard was born on October 21, 1949, in 
        Mount Vernon, Ohio.
            (2) While residing in Newark, Ohio, Daniel L. Kinnard 
        enlisted in the Army at Fort Hayes, Ohio, on November 14, 1966, 
        and served as a Specialist Fourth Class in the 101st Airborne 
        Division.
            (3) Specialist Kinnard was awarded the National Defense 
        Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, 
        Parachutist Badge, Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar, Bronze 
        Star for Valor, Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and the 
        Combat Medical Badge.
            (4) Specialist Kinnard's citation for the Bronze Star said, 
        ``For heroism in combat against a hostile force in the Republic 
        of Vietnam on 17 February 1968. Specialist Four Kinnard 
        distinguished himself while attached as a medic on a combat 
        operation near Quang Tri, Republic of Vietnam. The point 
        platoon made contact with enemy positions in a hedgerow and two 
        of the point men were seriously wounded. Without hesitation, 
        Specialist Kinnard rushed through the heavy volume of enemy 
        fire to reach the wounded men. With complete disregard for his 
        own personal safety, Specialist Kinnard remained exposed to 
        enemy fire while he treated the wounded men. Once he 
        administered first aid to the wounded, Specialist Kinnard 
        organized their evacuation under fire. His personal bravery and 
        devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of 
        the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his 
        unit, and United States Army.''.
            (5) Specialist Kinnard was killed in action on March 9, 
        1968, while rendering aid to his fellow paratroopers.
