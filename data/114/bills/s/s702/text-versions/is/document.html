security on the basis of material information that the person knows or 
has reason to know is not publicly available.
    ``(B) To knowingly or recklessly communicate material information 
that the person knows or has reason to know is not publicly available 
to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably 
foreseeable that such communication is likely to result in a violation 
of subparagraph (A).
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term `not publicly 
available' shall not include information that the person has 
independently developed from publicly available sources.
    ``(3) The Commission may, by rule, exempt any person, transaction, 
or communication, or any class of persons, transactions, or 
communications from the prohibitions under this subsection, if the 
Commission determines that such exemption is necessary or appropriate 
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors.
    ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect 
liability under subsection (b).''; and
            (2) in the flush text at the end of the section--
