   To direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain 
 membership status for India in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
                    (APEC), and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF INDIA IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC ECONOMIC 
              COOPERATION REGIONAL ECONOMIC FORUM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Republic of India is the world's ninth largest 
        economy in nominal terms and the third largest economy based on 
        purchasing-power parity.
            (2) The United States-India partnership is vital to United 
        States strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region and 
        across the globe, and is an integral aspect to the 
        Administration's Rebalance to Asia.
            (3) United States-India bilateral trade and investment 
        continue to expand, supporting thousands of United States jobs.
            (4) The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) regional 
        economic forum is the premier Asia-Pacific economic forum with 
        a goal to support sustainable economic growth and prosperity in 
        the Asia-Pacific region.
            (5) APEC works to champion free, open trade and investment, 
        to promote and accelerate regional economic integration, to 
        encourage economic and technical cooperation, to enhance human 
        security, and to facilitate a favorable and sustainable 
        business environment.
            (6) APEC held a moratorium on new membership from 1997 to 
        2010, which has since been lifted.
            (7) India has pursued membership in APEC for over 20 years, 
        and became an APEC observer in November 2011 at the invitation 
        of the United States, when the forum met in Hawaii.
            (8) India enjoys a location within the Asia-Pacific region 
        which provides an avenue for continued trade and investment 
        partnerships with APEC member states.
            (9) India has been or is pursuing bilateral or multilateral 
        trade agreements with the majority of APEC member states.
            (10) India's ``Look East, Act East'' strategy to expand 
        economic engagement with East and Southeast Asia demonstrates 
        its effort to pursue external oriented, market-driven economic 
        policies.
    (b) Actions.--The Secretary of State shall--
            (1) develop a strategy to obtain membership status for 
        India in APEC, including participation in related meetings, 
        working groups, activities, and mechanisms; and
            (2) actively urge APEC member states to support such 
        membership status for India.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report, 
in unclassified form, describing the United States strategy to obtain 
membership status for India in APEC. Such report shall be updated and 
submitted annually until such time as India obtains membership in APEC. 
Each such report shall include the following:
            (1) A description of the efforts the Secretary has made to 
        encourage APEC member states to promote India's bid to obtain 
        membership status.
            (2) The further steps the Secretary will take to assist 
        India in obtaining membership status for APEC.
