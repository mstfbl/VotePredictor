To require the Secretary of Defense to expand the Secretarial Designee 
  Program of the Department of Defense to include victims of acts of 
                                terror.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PROVISION OF HEALTH CARE UNDER SECRETARIAL DESIGNEE PROGRAM OF 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR TRAUMATIC INJURIES SUFFERED BY 
              VICTIMS OF TERRORISM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) victims of acts of terror in the United States deserve 
        the best available medical treatment;
            (2) military treatment facilities possess the vital 
        expertise and experience to provide unique care for victims of 
        acts of terror who incur blast and other injuries that result 
        in amputations and limb salvage procedures;
            (3) the Secretarial Designee Program of the Department of 
        Defense conducted under section 1074(c) of title 10, United 
        States Code, should be expanded to provide expert care in a 
        timely manner to victims of acts of terror;
            (4) the expansion of such program will not only benefit 
        victims, but also provide military treatment facilities such as 
        Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Uniformed 
        Services University of the Health Sciences with the ability to 
        provide ongoing education and training opportunities to mentor 
        the next generation of health care providers that will provide 
        care for members of the Armed Forces; and
            (5) care for victims of acts of terror should be provided 
        under the policies of the Department in effect as of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act that provide space at military 
        treatment facilities to civilians on a space available and 
        fully reimbursable basis.

Defense.--

                1074(c) of title 10, United States Code, to include the 
                provision of health care at military treatment 
                facilities for--
                            (i) victims of acts of terror that occur in 
                        the United States; and
                            (ii) residents of the United States who are 
                        victims of acts of terror outside the United

                basis in accordance with the policy of the Department 
                of Defense governing such program in effect as of the

                        Designee Program pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
                        if the Secretary determines that the injuries 
                        of the individual are severe enough to warrant

                Program pursuant to subparagraph (A) to a health care
