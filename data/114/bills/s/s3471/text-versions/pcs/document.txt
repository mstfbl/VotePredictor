        of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(e) Application of Qualification Requirements for Certain 
Multiple Employer Plans With Pooled Plan Providers.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if 
        a defined contribution plan to which subsection (c) applies--
                    ``(A) is sponsored by employers all of which have 
                both a common interest other than having adopted the 
                plan and control of the plan, or
                    ``(B) in the case of a plan not described in 
                subparagraph (A), has a pooled plan provider,
        then the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the 
        requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in 
        section 401(a) or to a plan that consists of individual 
        retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by 
        reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, 
        merely because one or more employers of employees covered by 
        the plan fail to take such actions as are required of such 
        employers for the plan to meet such requirements.
            ``(2) Limitations.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
                any plan unless the terms of the plan provide that in 
                cases of employers failing to take the actions 
                described in paragraph (1)--

                        to employees of the employer will be 
                        transferred to a plan maintained only by the 
                        employer (or its successor), to an eligible 
                        retirement plan as defined in section 
                        402(c)(8)(B) for each individual whose account

                        best interests of such employees to retain the 
                        assets in the plan, and

                        any liabilities with respect to such plan 
                        attributable to employees of the employer.

                pooled plan provider of a plan described in paragraph 
                (1)(B) does not perform substantially all of the 
                administrative duties which are required of the 
                provider under paragraph (3)(A)(i) for any plan year, 
                the Secretary, in the Secretary's own discretion, may 
                provide that the determination as to whether the plan 
                meets the requirements under this title applicable to a 
                plan described in section 401(a) or to a plan that 
                consists of individual retirement accounts described in 
                section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) 
                thereof), whichever is applicable, shall be made in the 
                same manner as would be made without regard to

                401(a) or 408, whichever is applicable, has continued

        Finance of the Senate and the Committee on the Ways and Means

implementation of the restrictions imposed by the amendment made by 
subsection (a), result in greater usage of retirement savings for 
purposes other than funding retirement than loans made by other means, 
the report under paragraph (2) shall include recommendations to reduce 
such result.

              PROVIDER.

    Section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1104) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Safe Harbor for Annuity Selection.--

        this subsection shall be construed to require a fiduciary to

        contract and attributes of the insurer (including, without 
        limitation, the insurer's financial strength) in conjunction

                aware of facts that would cause the fiduciary to 
                question such representations.
