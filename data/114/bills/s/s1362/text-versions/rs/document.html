    To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to clarify waiver 
  authority regarding programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly 
                            (PACE programs).

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF WAIVER AUTHORITY REGARDING PACE 
              PROGRAMS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Clarification of Waiver Authority Regarding PACE 
Programs.--Subsection (d)(1) of section 1115A of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) by inserting ``(other than subsections 
        (b)(1)(A) and (c)(5) of section 1894)'' after ``XVIII''; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by striking ``and 1903(m)(2)(A)(iii)'' and 
        inserting ``1903(m)(2)(A)(iii), and 1934 (other than 
        subsections (b)(1)(A) and (c)(5) of such section)''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate 
that the Secretary of Health and Human Services should use the waiver 
authority provided under the amendments made by this section to 
provide, in a budget neutral and expeditious manner, programs of all-
inclusive care for the elderly (PACE programs) with increased 
operational flexibility to support the ability of such programs to 
improve and innovate and to reduce technical and administrative 
barriers that have hindered enrollment in such programs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF WAIVER AUTHORITY REGARDING PACE PROGRAMS.

    Subsection (d)(1) of section 1115A of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1315a) is amended by striking ``and 1903(m)(2)(A)(iii)'' and 
inserting ``1903(m)(2)(A)(iii), and 1934 (other than subsections 
(b)(1)(A) and (c)(5) of such section)''.
