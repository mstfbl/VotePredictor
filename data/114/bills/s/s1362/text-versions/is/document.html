  authority regarding programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly 
                            (PACE programs).

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF WAIVER AUTHORITY REGARDING PACE PROGRAMS.

    (a) Clarification of Waiver Authority Regarding PACE Programs.--
Subsection (d)(1) of section 1115A of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1315a) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(other than subsections (b)(1)(A) and 
        (c)(5) of section 1894)'' after ``XVIII''; and
            (2) by striking ``and 1903(m)(2)(A)(iii)'' and inserting 
        ``1903(m)(2)(A)(iii), and 1934 (other than subsections 
        (b)(1)(A) and (c)(5) of such section)''.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services should use the waiver authority 
provided under the amendments made by this section to provide, in a 
budget neutral and expeditious manner, programs of all-inclusive care 
for the elderly (PACE programs) with increased operational flexibility 
to support the ability of such programs to improve and innovate and to 
reduce technical and administrative barriers that have hindered 
enrollment in such programs.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
