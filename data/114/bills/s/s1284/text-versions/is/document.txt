 To clarify the treatment of carbon emissions from forest biomass, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CARBON EMISSIONS FROM FOREST BIOMASS.

    In taking an action regarding air emissions from an energy source 
or facility that uses forest biomass, the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency shall assume that forest biomass 
emissions do not increase overall carbon accumulations in the 
atmosphere if--
            (1) a Forest Inventory and Analysis of the Department of 
        Agriculture that is current at the time the action is taken 
        shows that forest carbon stocks in the United States are stable 
        or increasing; or
            (2) the forest biomass is derived from mill residuals, 
        harvest residuals, or forest management activities.
                                 <all>
