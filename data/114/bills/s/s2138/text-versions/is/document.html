                States would be seriously injured unless the agency is 
                permitted to accept the subcontracting plan.''.

SEC. 5. GOOD FAITH COMPLIANCE.

    Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall issue 
regulations providing examples of activities that would be considered a 
failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements 
imposed on an entity, other than a small business concern, (as defined 
in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), that is 
awarded a prime contract containing the clauses required under 
paragraphs (4) or (5) of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 637(d)).
