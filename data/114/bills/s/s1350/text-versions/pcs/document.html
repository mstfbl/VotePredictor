SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a robust, modern transportation network is critical to 
        the economic growth and success of the Nation, the States, 
        cities, counties, towns, and rural areas;
            (2) the value of Federal revenues dedicated to surface 
        transportation infrastructure has diminished over time due to 
        inflation, vehicle efficiency, alternative fuels, and 
        demographic trends;
            (3) there is a significant and urgent need for additional 
        Federal investment to repair, rehabilitate, modernize, improve, 
        and expand all modes of surface transportation infrastructure;
            (4) the country urgently needs a long-term authorization of 
        surface transportation programs to support State and local 
        transportation officials in making the best use of taxpayer 
        funds and achieving a high return on their investment;
            (5) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
        the Senate, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
        Transportation of the Senate, the Committee on Environment and 
        Public Works of the Senate, and the Committee on Transportation 
        and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives should 
        develop and, as soon as practicable, report out legislation 
        providing for a long-term authorization of surface 
        transportation programs within their respective jurisdictions;
            (6) the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives 
        should develop and, as soon as practicable, report out 
        legislation providing sufficient revenue to offset the cost of 
        such a long-term authorization of surface transportation 
        programs; and
            (7) the Senate and the House of Representatives should pass 
        legislation providing for a long-term authorization of surface 
        transportation programs, appoint conferees, and agree to a 
        conference report as soon as practicable.
