                                 A BILL


 
     To adjust the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains National 
  Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor 
Preservation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was 
        authorized as a unit of the National Park System on November 
        10, 1978;
            (2) the Santa Monica Mountains and the Rim of the Valley 
        Corridor include a diverse range of nationally significant 
        natural and cultural resources;
            (3) expanding the Santa Monica Mountains National 
        Recreation Area would provide new opportunities for the 
        National Park Service to serve a broad range of urban 
        communities, including many communities that are--
                    (A) underrepresented in units of the National Park 
                System; and
                    (B) underserved by State and local parks;
            (4) the Santa Susana Field Laboratory is located in the 
        Simi Hills in southeastern Ventura County, California, within 
        the external boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Corridor;
            (5) activities at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory have--
                    (A) included rocket engine testing and research and 
                development of fuels, propellants, nuclear power, and 
                lasers; and
                    (B) resulted in releases of radioactive and 
                hazardous substances into the environment that require 
                cleanup;
            (6) in 2010, the California Department of Toxic Substances 
        Control, the Department of Energy, and the National Aeronautics 
        and Space Administration entered into administrative orders on 
        consent for the cleanup of contamination in soil to background 
        levels on the portions of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory 
        covered by the orders, with certain limited specified 
        exceptions; and
            (7) Congress expects that a comparable cleanup will occur 
        on the remaining portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 
        such that the cleanup on the remaining portion will be 
        protective of all allowable uses under Ventura County, 
        California, zoning and general plan designations for the Santa 
        Susana Field Laboratory in effect as of December 7, 2016.
