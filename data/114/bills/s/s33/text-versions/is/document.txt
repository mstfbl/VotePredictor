    (b) Conclusion of Review.--For purposes of subsection (a), review 
required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.

            (1) for a project requiring an Environmental Impact 
        Statement, publishes a Final Environmental Impact Statement;
            (2) for a project for which an Environmental Assessment has 
        been prepared, publishes a Finding of No Significant Impact; or

        original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for 
        the review of--
                    (A) an order issued by the Secretary with respect 
                to such application; or

        subsection (a), the Court shall order the Secretary to issue 
        the decision not later than 30 days after the Court's order.
            (3) Expedited consideration.--The Court shall set any civil 
        action brought under this subsection for expedited

        practical after the filing date of the initial pleading.
            (4) Appeals.--In the case of an application described in 
        subsection (a) for which a petition for review has been filed--
                    (A) upon motion by an applicant, the matter shall 
                be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals 
                for the District of Columbia Circuit or the circuit in 
                which a liquefied natural gas export facility will be
