                                 AN ACT


 
 To direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to make anthrax vaccines 
   available to emergency response providers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder Anthrax Preparedness 
Act''.

SEC. 2. VOLUNTARY PRE-EVENT ANTHRAX VACCINATION PILOT PROGRAM FOR 
              EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROVIDERS.

    (a) Pilot Program.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
        coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
        shall carry out a pilot program to provide eligible anthrax 
        vaccines from the Strategic National Stockpile under section 
        319F-2(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-
        6b(a)) that will be nearing the end of their labeled dates of 
        use at the time such vaccines are made available to States for 
        administration to emergency response providers who would be at 
        high risk of exposure to anthrax if such an attack should occur 
        and who voluntarily consent to such administration.
            (2) Determination.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services shall determine whether an anthrax vaccine is eligible 
        to be provided to the Secretary of Homeland Security for the 
        pilot program described in paragraph (1) based on--
                    (A) a determination that the vaccine is not 
                otherwise allotted for other purposes;
                    (B) a determination that the provision of the 
                vaccine will not reduce, or otherwise adversely affect, 
                the capability to meet projected requirements for this 
                product during a public health emergency, including a 
                significant reduction of available quantities of 
                vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile; and
                    (C) such other considerations as determined 
                appropriate by the Secretary of Health and Human 
                Services.
            (3) Preliminary requirements.--Before implementing the 
        pilot program required under this subsection, the Secretary of 
        Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services, shall--
                    (A) establish a communication platform for the 
                pilot program;
                    (B) develop and deliver education and training for 
                the pilot program;
                    (C) conduct economic analysis of the pilot program, 
                including a preliminary estimate of total costs and 
                expected benefits;
                    (D) create a logistical platform for the anthrax 
                vaccine request process under the pilot program;
                    (E) establish goals and desired outcomes for the 
                pilot program; and
                    (F) establish a mechanism to reimburse the 
                Secretary of Health and Human Services for--
                            (i) the costs of shipment and 
                        transportation of such vaccines provided to the 
                        Secretary of Homeland Security from the 
                        Strategic National Stockpile under such pilot 
                        program, including staff time directly 
                        supporting such shipment and transportation; 
                        and
                            (ii) the amount, if any, by which the 
                        warehousing costs of the Strategic National 
                        Stockpile are increased in order to operate 
                        such pilot program.
            (4) Location.--
                    (A) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program 
                required under this subsection, the Secretary of 
                Homeland Security shall select not fewer than 2 nor 
                more than 5 States for voluntary participation in the 
                pilot program.
                    (B) Requirement.--Each State that participates in 
                the pilot program under this subsection shall ensure

                247d-3a).
            (5) Guidance for selection.--To ensure that participation 
        in the pilot program under this subsection strategically 
        increases State and local response readiness in the event of an 
        anthrax release, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
        coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
        shall provide guidance to participating States and units of 
        local government on identifying emergency response providers 
        who are at high risk of exposure to anthrax.
            (6) Distribution of information.--The Secretary of Homeland 
        Security shall require that each State that participates in the 
        pilot program under this subsection submit a written 
        certification to the Secretary of Homeland Security stating 
        that each emergency response provider within the State that 
        participates in the pilot program is provided with disclosures 
        and educational materials designated by the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services, which may include--
                    (A) materials regarding the associated benefits and 
                risks of any vaccine provided under the pilot program, 
                and of exposure to anthrax;
                    (B) additional material consistent with the Centers

                and
                    (C) notice that the Federal Government is not 
                obligated to continue providing anthrax vaccine after 
                the date on which the pilot program ends.
            (7) Memorandum of understanding.--Before implementing the 
        pilot program under this subsection, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services to--
                    (A) define the roles and responsibilities of each
