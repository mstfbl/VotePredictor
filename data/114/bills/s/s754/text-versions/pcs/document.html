        sharing a cyber threat indicator pursuant to this Act shall, 
        prior to such sharing--
                    (A) review such cyber threat indicator to assess 
                whether such cyber threat indicator contains any 
                information that the entity knows at the time of 
                sharing to be personal information of or identifying a 
                specific person not directly related to a cybersecurity 
                threat and remove such information; or

                        that would qualify as a cyber threat indicator 
                        under this Act that would be unlikely to 
                        include personal information of or identifying 
                        a specific person not directly related to a
