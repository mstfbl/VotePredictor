            ``(3) Individual subsidy rate upon request.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If the administering authority 
                determines under paragraph (2) that it is not 
                practicable to determine an individual countervailable 
                subsidy rate for an exporter or producer and the number 
                of exporters and producers involved in the 
                investigation or review is not more than 4, the 
                administering authority shall, at the request of the 
                exporter or producer, determine an individual 
                countervailable subsidy rate for the exporter or 
                producer.
                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--Subparagraph (A) may 
                not be construed as specifying that more than 4 
                exporters and producers constitutes a large number of 
                exporters and producers for purposes of paragraph 
                (2).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
        apply to any investigation or review initiated by the 
        administering authority on or after March 1, 2015.
            (2) Administering authority defined.--In this subsection, 
        the term ``administering authority'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 771(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
        1677(1)).
