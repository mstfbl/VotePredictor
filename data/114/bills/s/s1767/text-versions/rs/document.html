    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Combination Product 
Regulatory Fairness Act of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. DEVICE DEFINITION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 321(h)) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (1), (2), and 
        (3) as clauses (A), (B), and (C), respectively;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by striking ``(h)'' and inserting ``(h)(1)''; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2)(A) Before determining that an article does not meet 
the definition of a device under this paragraph, the Secretary shall 
provide to the sponsor of the article competent and reliable scientific 
rationale that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) cites any scientific evidence relied upon to 
        support the rationale; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) supports such determination. &lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) If the Secretary makes a determination described in 
clause (A)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) the sponsor of the article may propose a 
        nonclinical or clinical study, limited to not more data than 
        necessary to establish the significance, if any, of the 
        chemical action in achieving the primary intended purpose of 
        the article; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) the Secretary and the sponsor of the 
        article shall collaborate in good faith to reach agreement, 
        within a reasonable time not to exceed 90 days, on the design 
        of such study.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) The data resulting from a study conducted under 
clause (B) shall inform the classification of the article.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. COMBINATION PRODUCTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 503(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 353(g)) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (5) as 
        paragraphs (6) through (9), respectively;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by striking ``(g)(1)'' and all that follows 
        through the end of paragraph (1) and inserting the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(g)(1)(A) The Secretary shall, in accordance with this 
subsection, assign an agency center to regulate products that 
constitute a combination of a drug, device, or biological product 
(referred to in this subsection as the `lead center').&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) The Secretary shall conduct the premarket review of 
any combination product, whenever possible, under a single application 
using existing premarket review authorities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) The Secretary shall determine the primary mode of 
action of the combination product. If the Secretary determines that the 
primary mode of action is that of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) a drug (other than a biological product), 
        the agency center charged with premarket review of drugs shall 
        have primary jurisdiction;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) a device, the agency center charged with 
        premarket review of devices shall have primary jurisdiction; 
        or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(iii) a biological product, the agency center 
        charged with premarket review of biological products shall have 
        primary jurisdiction.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(D) In determining the primary mode of action of a 
combination product, the Secretary shall not determine that the primary 
mode of action is that of a drug or biological product solely because 
the combination product has any chemical action within or on the human 
body.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(E) If the Secretary disagrees with the conclusions of 
the sponsor on the primary mode of action of the combination product, 
the Secretary shall provide a competent and reliable scientific 
rationale to the product sponsor that cites any scientific evidence 
relied upon to support the decision.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(F) For purposes of this paragraph--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) the term `primary mode of action' means the 
        single mode of action of a combination product that provides 
        the most important therapeutic action of the combination 
        product; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) the term `most important therapeutic 
        action' means the mode of action expected to make the greatest 
        contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the 
        combination product.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2)(A) The sponsor of a combination product may submit a 
combination product review plan (referred to in this subsection as a 
`CPRP') for the combination product, and may request a meeting prior to 
submission of the CPRP, to establish clarity and certainty for the 
sponsor regarding the standards and requirements applicable to--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) the review of safety and effectiveness, or 
        substantial equivalence, of the combination product;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) a postmarket modification of the 
        combination product; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(iii) good manufacturing practices for the 
        combination product.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) Not later than 60 days after the sponsor of a 
combination product submits a proposed CPRP, including a revision to a 
previously proposed or approved CPRP, the Secretary shall review the 
CPRP and--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) if the Secretary determines that the CPRP is 
        appropriate to ensure adequate review of the safety and 
        effectiveness, or substantial equivalence, of the combination 
        product--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(I) approve the CPRP; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                indicating such approval; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) if the Secretary finds that the CPRP does 
        not meet the standard specified in clause (i)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

subparagraph, meet with such sponsor to discuss the CPRP.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

necessary for discussion and agreement on the level of evidence 
necessary to ensure adequate review of the safety and effectiveness, or 
substantial equivalence, of the combination product.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

be changed after approval of the agreement, except--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        determining the safety or effectiveness, or substantial

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combination Product Regulatory 
Fairness Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. COMBINATION PRODUCTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 503(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 353(g)) is amended--
            (1) by striking paragraph (3);
            (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (7);
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs 
        (8) and (9), respectively; and
            (4) by striking ``(g)(1)'' and all that follows through the 
        end of paragraph (1) and inserting the following:
    ``(g)(1)(A) The Secretary shall, in accordance with this 
subsection, assign a primary agency center to regulate products that 
constitute a combination of a drug, device, or biological product.
    ``(B) The Secretary shall conduct the premarket review of any 
combination product under a single application, whenever appropriate.
    ``(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term `primary mode of 
action' means the single mode of action of a combination product 
expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended 
therapeutic effects of the combination product.
    ``(D) The Secretary shall determine the primary mode of action of 
the combination product. If the Secretary determines that the primary 
mode of action is that of--
            ``(i) a drug (other than a biological product), the agency 
        center charged with premarket review of drugs shall have 
        primary jurisdiction;
            ``(ii) a device, the agency center charged with premarket 
        review of devices shall have primary jurisdiction; or
            ``(iii) a biological product, the agency center charged 
        with premarket review of biological products shall have primary 
        jurisdiction.
    ``(E) In determining the primary mode of action of a combination 
product, the Secretary shall not determine that the primary mode of 
action is that of a drug or biological product solely because the 
combination product has any chemical action within or on the human 
body.
    ``(F) If a sponsor of a combination product disagrees with the 
determination under subparagraph (D)--
            ``(i) such sponsor may request, and the Secretary shall 
        provide, a substantive rationale to such sponsor that 
        references scientific evidence provided by the sponsor and any 
        other scientific evidence relied upon by the Secretary to 
        support such determination; and
            ``(ii)(I) the sponsor of the combination product may 
        propose one or more studies (which may be nonclinical, 
        clinical, or both) to establish the relevance, if any, of the 
        chemical action in achieving the primary mode of action of such 
        product;
            ``(II) if the sponsor proposes any such studies, the 
        Secretary and the sponsor of such product shall collaborate and 
        seek to reach agreement, within a reasonable time of such 
        proposal, not to exceed 90 calendar days, on the design of such 
        studies; and
            ``(III) if an agreement is reached under subclause (II) and 
        the sponsor conducts one or more of such studies, the Secretary 
        shall consider the data resulting from any such study when 
        reevaluating the determination of the primary mode of action of 
        such product, and unless and until such reevaluation has 
        occurred and the Secretary issues a new determination, the 
        determination of the Secretary under subparagraph (D) shall 
        remain in effect.
    ``(2)(A)(i) To establish clarity and certainty for the sponsor, the 
sponsor of a combination product may submit a proposed combination 
product review plan with respect to such combination product, at any 
point following the Secretary's determination of the primary mode of 
action pursuant to paragraph (1).
    ``(ii) Such proposed combination product review plan may--
            ``(I) address the standards and requirements for market 
        approval or clearance of the combination product;
            ``(II) address other issues relevant to such combination 
        product, such as requirements related to postmarket 
        modification of such combination product and good manufacturing 
        practices applicable to such combination product; and
            ``(III) identify elements under subclauses (I) and (II) 
        that may be more appropriate for discussion and agreement with 
        the Secretary at a later date given that scientific or other 
        information is not available, or agreement is otherwise not 
        feasible regarding such elements, at the time such plan is 
        submitted.
    ``(B) After the sponsor of a combination product submits a proposed 
combination product review plan under subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
shall review such plan and, in a written response to such sponsor--
            ``(i) accept such plan in its entirety, which may include 
        elements to be the subject of discussion and agreement between 
        the sponsor and the Secretary at a later date, as described in 
        subparagraph (A)(ii)(III);
            ``(ii) accept the plan in part, which may include elements 
        that have not been accepted at the time of the response and are 
        to be the subject of discussion and agreement between the 
        sponsor and the Secretary at a later date, as described in 
        subparagraph (A)(ii)(III), and elements that the Secretary 
        declines to accept; or
            ``(iii) deny such plan in its entirety.
    ``(C) When reviewing a proposed combination product review plan 
under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall accept such plan, or 
elements of such plan, if the Secretary determines that the data to be 
collected is appropriate--
            ``(i) for market approval or clearance of the combination 
        product; or
            ``(ii) to otherwise meet relevant standards under this Act, 
        as applicable.
    ``(D)(i) If the Secretary declines to accept a proposed combination 
product review plan under subparagraph (B)(iii), or elements of such a 
plan under subparagraph (B)(ii), the Secretary shall, in the written 
response to such sponsor--
            ``(I) include a description of the deficiencies of such 
        plan or such elements, as applicable; and
            ``(II) clarify what elements may be suitable for discussion 
        at a later date.
    ``(ii) If the Secretary declines to accept a proposed combination 
product review plan under subparagraph (B)(iii), or elements of such a 
plan under subparagraph (B)(ii), the sponsor of such plan may request a 
meeting with the Secretary. Upon the request of the sponsor, the 
Secretary, including any necessary experts from the relevant agency 
centers, shall meet with the sponsor to discuss a proposed combination 
product review plan or elements of a combination product review plan 
that the Secretary has declined to accept, for the purpose of 
discussing the information and requirements necessary to make the plan 
or elements of such plan acceptable. Minutes of such meeting shall be 
made part of the administrative record.
    ``(iii) If the Secretary declines to accept a proposed combination 
product review plan under subparagraph (B)(iii), or elements of such a 
plan under subparagraph (B)(ii), a sponsor may resubmit a proposed 
combination product review plan for consideration by the Secretary 
under subparagraph (A).
    ``(E) A combination product review plan accepted under subparagraph 
(B)(i), or the elements of a combination product review plan that are 
accepted under subparagraph (B)(ii), shall remain in effect, except--
            ``(i) with the written agreement of the Secretary and the 
        sponsor or applicant; or
            ``(ii) pursuant to a decision, made in accordance with 
        subparagraph (F) by the director of the reviewing division of 
        the primary agency center, or a person more senior than such 
        director, in consultation with consulting centers and the 
        Office, that an important, materially relevant scientific issue 
        essential to determining the safety or effectiveness, or 
        substantial equivalence, as applicable, of the combination 
        product has been identified since a combination product review 
        plan or elements of a combination product review plan were 
        accepted, as applicable.
    ``(F) If the Secretary makes a decision under subparagraph (E)(ii), 
the Secretary shall provide notice, within a reasonable time after such 
decision, to the sponsor of the combination product subject to such 
decision and provide an opportunity for a meeting with the Secretary, 
to take place within a reasonable time after issuing such notice, at 
which--
            ``(i) the director of the reviewing division of the primary 
        agency center, or a person more senior than such director, 
        staff from the consulting centers, representatives of the 
        Office, and the sponsor shall be represented; and
            ``(ii) the director of the reviewing division of the 
        primary agency center, or a person more senior than the 
        director, shall describe the important, materially relevant 
        issue involved to such sponsor.
    ``(3) For purposes of conducting the premarket review of a 
combination product that contains an approved constituent part 
described in paragraph (4), the Secretary may require that the sponsor 
of such combination product submit to the Secretary only data or 
information that the Secretary determines is necessary to assess the 
safety and effectiveness of the combination product, including any 
incremental risks and benefits posed by such combination product, using 
a risk-based approach and taking into account any prior finding of 
safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence for the approved 
constituent part relied upon by the applicant in accordance with 
paragraph (5).
    ``(4) For purposes of paragraph (3), an approved constituent part 
is--

        515, 510(k), or 513(f)(2) (submitted in accordance with 
        paragraph (5)), that is an approved drug, provided such 
        application or request complies with paragraph (5);

        cleared, or classified under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), or

containing as a constituent part an approved drug--
