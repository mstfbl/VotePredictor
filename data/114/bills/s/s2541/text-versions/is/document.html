                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to clarify provisions enacted 
   by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act to further the conservation of 
                      prohibited wildlife species.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Big Cat Public Safety Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) as of February 2016--
                    (A) the global illicit trade in wildlife is 
                estimated to be worth up to $20,000,000,000 annually; 
                and
                    (B) the legal wildlife trade in the United States 
                was estimated to have a value of $2,800,000,000 
                annually;
            (2) the illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species (as 
        defined in section 2 of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 
        U.S.C. 3371)) stimulates demand and expands markets in which 
        prohibited wildlife species are sold illegally;
            (3) private possession, breeding, and sale of prohibited 
        wildlife species have substantial and detrimental effects on--
                    (A) the health and general welfare of the people of 
                the United States; and
                    (B) the conservation of the prohibited wildlife 
                species;
            (4) the private possession and breeding of prohibited 
        wildlife species has a substantial and direct effect on 
        interstate commerce because prohibited wildlife species are 
        often--
                    (A) bred and possessed--
                            (i) for use in public exhibition; or
                            (ii) for sale or transfer of ownership in 
                        the exotic pet trade; and
                    (B) transported in interstate commerce for the 
                activities described in subparagraph (A);
            (5) the private possession and breeding of prohibited 
        wildlife species contributes to interstate trafficking in 
        prohibited wildlife species and may contribute to the 
        international illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species;
            (6) prohibited wildlife species in private possession and 
        prohibited wildlife species that are subject to intrastate 
        distribution are fungible commodities that cannot be 
        differentiated, for purposes of control, from prohibited 
        wildlife species that are subject to interstate distribution;
            (7) it is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between--
                    (A) prohibited wildlife species that have been 
                possessed, bred, sold, or transported in interstate 
                commerce; and
                    (B) prohibited wildlife species that have not been 
                possessed, bred, sold, or transported in interstate 
                commerce;
            (8) Federal control of intrastate private possession and 
        breeding of prohibited wildlife species is essential to the 
        effective control of interstate trafficking in prohibited 
        wildlife species; and
            (9) the United States is a party to the Convention on 
        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
        Flora, done at Washington March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; TIAS 
        8249), which was designed to protect species of wild fauna and 
        flora from exploitation through international trade.
