 To harness the expertise, ingenuity, and creativity of all people to 
    contribute to innovation in the United States and to help solve 
problems or scientific questions by encouraging and increasing the use 
    of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods within the Federal 
          Government, as appropriate, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the authority granted to Federal agencies under the 
        America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-
        358) to pursue the use of incentive prizes and challenges has 
        yielded numerous benefits, including--
                    (A) paying only for success;
                    (B) establishing an ambitious goal without having 
                to predict which team or approach is most likely to 
                succeed;
                    (C) reaching out to individuals or a broader group 
                of people to increase the number of minds tackling a 
                problem;
                    (D) bringing out-of-discipline perspectives to 
                bear; and
                    (E) increasing cost-effectiveness to maximize the 
                return on taxpayer dollars;
            (2) granting Federal agencies the direct, explicit 
        authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will--
                    (A) remove ambiguity about whether an agency can 
                use these techniques;
                    (B) encourage its appropriate use to advance agency 
                missions; and
                    (C) stimulate and facilitate broader public 
                participation in the innovation process;
            (3) crowdsourcing projects have a number of unique 
        benefits, including--
                    (A) improving the delivery of government services 
                with significantly lower Federal or other public 
                resource investments or at time scales or distribution 
                scales that might not otherwise be possible;
                    (B) connecting citizens to the missions of Federal 
                agencies by promoting a spirit of open government and 
                volunteerism;
                    (C) providing the acquisition of data at a greater 
                geographic extent and in locations with a greater 
                density or frequency than otherwise reasonably 
                obtainable using conventional methods; and
                    (D) enabling citizens to address community and 
                research-based concerns by gathering, analyzing, and 
                sharing data and information;
            (4) citizen science has additional benefits, including--
                    (A) advancing and accelerating scientific research 
                through group discovery, the cocreation of knowledge, 
                and the inclusion of diverse perspectives;
                    (B) improving science literacy and providing skills 
                needed to excel in science, technology, engineering, 
                and math, thereby increasing American competitiveness;
                    (C) furthering science diplomacy through the 
                worldwide collaboration between scientists and 
                citizens; and
                    (D) building trust and understanding between 
                citizens and science and between citizens and 
                scientists; and
            (5) since participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science 
        projects participate in crowdsourcing or citizen science for a 
        variety of reasons, Federal agencies should consider meaningful 
        incentives to engage and retain participants depending on the 
        range of motivations for potential participants, including--
                    (A) receiving attribution for their contributions 
                to research;
                    (B) learning new skills and knowledge or educating 
                others;
                    (C) connecting with new individuals or communities 
                and building relationships; and
                    (D) knowing that their work is helping to solve 
                meaningful problems and contributing to broader 
                scientific endeavors for the benefit of society.
