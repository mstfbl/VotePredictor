                                 AN ACT


 
 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to preserve access to 
     rehabilitation innovation centers under the Medicare program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Rehabilitation Innovation 
Centers Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the United States, there are an estimated 1,181 
        inpatient rehabilitation facilities. Among these facilities is 
        a small group of inpatient rehabilitation institutions that are 
        contributing to the future of rehabilitation care medicine, as 
        well as to patient recovery, scientific innovation, and quality 
        of life.
            (2) This unique category of inpatient rehabilitation 
        institutions treats the most complex patient conditions, such 
        as traumatic brain injury, stroke, spinal cord injury, 
        childhood disease, burns, and wartime injuries.
            (3) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions are 
        all not-for-profit or Government-owned institutions and serve a 
        high volume of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries.
            (4) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions 
        have been recognized by the Federal Government for their 
        contributions to cutting-edge research to develop solutions 
        that enhance quality of care, improve patient outcomes, and 
        reduce health care costs.
            (5) These leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions 
        help to improve the practice and standard of rehabilitation 
        medicine across the Nation in urban, suburban, and rural 
        communities by training physicians, medical students, and other 
        clinicians, and providing care to patients from all 50 States.
            (6) It is vital that these leading inpatient rehabilitation 
        institutions are supported so they can continue to lead the 
        Nation's efforts to--
                    (A) advance integrated, multidisciplinary 
                rehabilitation research;
                    (B) provide cutting-edge medical care to the most 
                complex rehabilitation patients;
                    (C) serve as education and training facilities for 
                the physicians, nurses, and other health professionals 
                who serve rehabilitation patients;
                    (D) ensure Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 
                receive state-of-the-art, high-quality rehabilitation 
                care by developing and disseminating best practices and 
                advancing the quality of care utilized by post-acute 
                providers in all 50 States; and
                    (E) support other inpatient rehabilitation 
                institutions in rural areas to help ensure access to 
                quality post-acute care for patients living in these 
                communities.
