            ``(1) In general.--In the case of a distilled spirits 
        operation, the otherwise applicable tax rate under subsection 
        (a)(1) on the first 100,000 of proof gallons of distilled 
        spirits which are removed in the calendar year and which have 
        been distilled, processed, or bottled by such operation at a 
        qualified facility in the United States shall be $2.70 per 
        proof gallon.
            ``(2) Controlled groups.--In the case of a controlled

        the preceding sentence, the term `controlled group' shall have 
        the meaning given such term by subsection (a) of section 1563,

        least 80 percent' each place it appears in such subsection. 
        Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles 
        similar to the principles of the preceding two sentences shall 
        be applied to a group under common control where one or more of
