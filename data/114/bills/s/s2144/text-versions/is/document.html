SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government of North Korea--
                    (A) has repeatedly violated its commitments to the 
                complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of 
                its nuclear weapons programs; and
                    (B) has willfully violated multiple United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions calling for it to cease 
                its development, testing, and production of weapons of 
                mass destruction.
            (2) Based on its past actions, including the transfer of 
        sensitive nuclear and missile technology to state sponsors of 
        terrorism, North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation 
        of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
            (3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated 
        repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, 
        including--
                    (A) prohibited arms sales;
                    (B) narcotics trafficking;
                    (C) the counterfeiting of United States currency;
                    (D) significant activities undermining 
                cybersecurity; and

                United States persons.
            (4) North Korea has--
                    (A) unilaterally withdrawn from the Korean War 
                Armistice Agreement, done at Panmunjom, Korea, July 27, 
                1953; and
                    (B) committed provocations against South Korea--
                            (i) by sinking the warship Cheonan and 
                        killing 46 of her crew on March 26, 2010;
                            (ii) by shelling Yeonpyeong Island and 
                        killing 4 South Korean civilians on November 
                        23, 2010; and
                            (iii) by its involvement in the 
                        ``DarkSeoul'' cyberattacks against the 
                        financial and communications interests of the 
                        Republic of Korea on March 20, 2013.

                insufficient food, clothing, and medical care; and
                    (B) under constant fear of torture or arbitrary 
                execution.

        North Korea's use of these transactions to promote 
        proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, 
        illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods--
                    (A) aid and abet North Korea's misuse of the 
                international financial system; and
                    (B) violate the intent of the United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions referred to in paragraph 
                (6)(A).
            (8) The Government of North Korea has provided technical 
        support and conducted destructive and coercive cyberattacks 
        against Sony Pictures Entertainment and other United States

                allies;

       TITLE I--INVESTIGATIONS, PROHIBITED CONDUCT, AND PENALTIES

SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    In order to achieve the peaceful disarmament of North Korea, 
Congress finds that it is necessary--
            (1) to encourage all member states to fully and promptly 
        implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 
        (adopted March 7, 2013);
            (2) to sanction the persons, including financial 
        institutions, that facilitate proliferation, illicit 
        activities, arms trafficking, cyberterrorism, imports of luxury 
        goods, serious human rights abuses, cash smuggling, and 
        censorship by the Government of North Korea;
            (3) to authorize the President to sanction persons who fail 
        to exercise due diligence to ensure that such financial 
        institutions and jurisdictions do not facilitate proliferation, 
        arms trafficking, kleptocracy, and imports of luxury goods by 
        the Government of North Korea;
            (4) to deny the Government of North Korea access to the 
        funds it uses to obtain nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, 
        cyberwarfare capabilities, and luxury goods instead of 
        providing for the needs of its people; and
            (5) to enforce sanctions in a manner that to the extent 
        possible avoids any adverse humanitarian impact on the people 
        of North Korea.

SEC. 102. INVESTIGATIONS.

    (a) Initiation.--The President shall initiate an investigation into 
the possible designation of a person under section 104(a) upon receipt

the Secretary of the Treasury, and the heads of other Federal

investigators, attorneys, and technical personnel--
            (1) to investigate the conduct described in subsections (a) 
        and (b) of section 104; and
            (2) to coordinate and ensure the effective enforcement of 
        this Act.

SEC. 103. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

 TITLE II--SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS 
                     ABUSES, AND ILLICIT ACTIVITIES

SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A JURISDICTION 
              OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial 
        Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the financial 
        system against illicit use, money laundering, terrorist 
        financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction, and has repeatedly expressed concern about North 
        Korea's misuse of the international financial system--
                    (A) in 2006--
                            (i) stated, ``Given [North Korea's] 
                        counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics 
                        trafficking and use of accounts world-wide to 
                        conduct proliferation-related transactions, the 
                        line between illicit and licit North Korean 
                        money is nearly invisible.''; and
                            (ii) urged financial institutions worldwide 
                        to ``think carefully about the risks of doing 
                        any North Korea-related business'';
                    (B) in 2011, stated that North Korea--
                            (i) ``remains intent on engaging in 
                        proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing 
                        in material''; and
                            (ii) was ``aggressively pursuing the effort 
                        to establish front companies.''; and
                    (C) in 2013, stated--
                            (i) in reference to North Korea's 
                        distribution of high-quality counterfeit United 
                        States currency, that ``North Korea is 
                        continuing to try to pass a supernote into the 
                        international financial system''; and
                            (ii) the Department of the Treasury would 
                        soon introduce new currency with improved 
                        security features to protect against 
                        counterfeiting by the Government of North 
                        Korea.
            (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental 
        body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and 
        international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist 
        financing, has repeatedly--
                    (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North 
                Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and 
                terrorist financing;
                    (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to 
                address significant deficiencies in these regimes and 
                the serious threat they pose to the integrity of the 
                international financial system;
                    (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply 
                countermeasures to protect the international financial 
                system from ongoing and substantial money laundering 
                and terrorist financing risks emanating from North 
                Korea;
                    (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their 
                financial institutions to give special attention to 
                business relationships and transactions with North 
                Korea, including North Korean companies and financial 
                institutions; and
                    (E) called on all jurisdictions--
                            (i) to protect against correspondent 
                        relationships being used to bypass or evade 
                        countermeasures and risk mitigation practices; 
                        and
                            (ii) to take into account money laundering 
                        and terrorist financing risks when considering 
                        requests by North Korean financial institutions 
                        to open branches and subsidiaries in their 
                        respective jurisdictions.
            (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council 
        unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--
                    (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's--
                            (i) recommendation on financial sanctions 
                        related to proliferation; and
                            (ii) guidance on the implementation of such 
                        sanctions;
                    (B) decided that United Nations Member States 
                should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal 
                measures to prevent the provision of financial services 
                or the transfer of property that could contribute to 
                activities prohibited by applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and
                    (C) called upon United Nations Member States to 
                prohibit North Korean banks from establishing or 
                maintaining correspondent relationships with banks in 
                their respective jurisdictions to prevent the provision 
                of financial services if such states have information 
                that provides reasonable grounds to believe that such 
                activities could contribute to--
                            (i) activities prohibited by an applicable 
                        United Nations Security Council resolution; or
                            (ii) the evasion of such prohibitions.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North Korea as a 
Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--Congress--
            (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security 
        Council to impose limitations on, and to require the enhanced 
        monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial 
        institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;
            (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms--
                    (A) to immediately designate North Korea as a 
                jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and
                    (B) to adopt stringent special measures to 
                safeguard the financial system against the risks posed 
                by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its 
                illicit activities; and
            (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation 
        by other states of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to 
        prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial 
        system, including by sharing information about activities, 
        transactions, and property that could contribute to--
                    (A) activities sanctioned by applicable United 
                Nations Security Council resolutions; or
                    (B) the evasion of such sanctions.
    (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State and Attorney General, 
        and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, United States 
        Code, shall determine whether reasonable grounds exist for 
        concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of primary money 
        laundering concern.
            (2) Enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements.--
        Except as provided in section 208, if the Secretary of the 
        Treasury determines under paragraph (1) that reasonable grounds 
        exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern, the Secretary, in 
        consultation with the Federal functional regulators, shall 
        impose 1 or more of the special measures described in section 
        5318A(b) of title 31, United States Code, with respect to the

                committees that contains the reasons for such 
                determination.
                    (B) Form.--The report submitted under subparagraph 
                (A) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may

              SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS 
              ON NORTH KOREA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) All member states and jurisdictions are obligated to 
        implement and enforce applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions fully and promptly, including by blocking 
        the property of, and ensuring that any property is prevented 
        from being made available to, persons designated by the 
        Security Council under applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions.
            (2) As of May 2015, 158 of the United Nations' 193 member 
        states have not submitted reports on measures taken to 
        implement North Korea-specific United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions (1718, 1874, and 2094).
            (3) A recent report by the Government Accountability Office 
        (GAO-15-485)--
                    (A) finds that officials of the United States and 
                representatives of the United Nations Panel of Experts 
                which monitors and facilitates implementation of United 
                Nations sanctions on North Korea ``agree that the lack 
                of detailed reports from all member states is an 
                impediment to the UN's effective implementation of its 
                sanctions''; and
                    (B) notes that ``many member states lack the 
                technical capacity to enforce sanctions and prepare 
                reports'' on the implementation of United Nations 
                sanctions on North Korea.
            (4) All states and jurisdictions share a common interest in 
        protecting the international financial system from the risks of 
        money laundering and illicit transactions emanating from North 
        Korea.
            (5) The United States dollar and the euro are the world's 
        principal reserve currencies, and the United States and the 
        European Union are primarily responsible for the protection of 
        the international financial system from these risks.
            (6) The cooperation of the People's Republic of China, as 
        North Korea's principal trading partner, is essential to--
                    (A) the enforcement of applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and
                    (B) the protection of the international financial 
                system.
            (7) The report of the Panel of Experts established pursuant 
        to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 (adopted on 
        June 11, 2013), expressed concern about the ability of banks 
        in--
                    (A) states with less effective regulators; and
                    (B) states that are unable to afford effective 
                compliance to detect and prevent illicit transfers 
                involving North Korea.
            (8) North Korea has historically exploited inconsistencies 
        between jurisdictions in the interpretation and enforcement of 
        financial regulations and applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions to circumvent sanctions and launder the 
        proceeds of illicit activities.
            (9) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East Land, and 
        Tanchon Commercial Bank have been designated by the Secretary 
        of the Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, and the 
        European Union as having materially contributed to the 
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
            (10) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking 
        Corporation have been designated by the Secretary of the 
        Treasury and the European Union as having materially 
        contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction.
            (11) The Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea has been 
        designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for facilitating 
        transactions on behalf of persons linked to its proliferation 
        network, and for serving as ``a key financial node''.
            (12) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated by the 
        Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohibited by 
        applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
        including the use of deceptive financial practices to 
        facilitate transactions on behalf of persons linked to North 
        Korea's proliferation network.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should intensify diplomatic efforts in appropriate 
international fora, such as the United Nations, and bilaterally, to 
develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy 
for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from 
North Korea, including--
            (1) the cessation of any financial services whose 
        continuation is inconsistent with applicable United Nations 
        Security Council resolutions;
            (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, 
        including financial institutions, that present unacceptable 
        risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity by 
        the Government of North Korea;
            (3) the blocking by all states and jurisdictions, in 
        accordance with the legal process of the state or jurisdiction 
        in which the property is held, of any property required to be 
        blocked under applicable United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions;
            (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit 
        activity, or from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement 
        of public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the 
        Government of North Korea;
            (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant 
        activities undermining cybersecurity by the Government of North 
        Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States persons, 
        or the theft of intellectual property by the Government of 
        North Korea, directly or indirectly from United States persons; 
        and
            (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or 
        indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by the 
        Government of North Korea.
    (c) Strategy To Improve International Implementation and 
Enforcement of UN North Korea-Specific Sanctions.--The President shall 
direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with other departments 
and agencies, as appropriate, to develop a strategy to improve 
international implementation and enforcement of United Nations North 
Korea-specific sanctions. This strategy should include elements--
            (1) to increase the number of countries submitting reports 
        to the United Nations Panel of Experts, including developing a 
        list of targeted countries where effective implementation and 
        enforcement of United Nations sanctions would reduce the North 
        Korean threat;
            (2) to encourage member states to cooperate and share 
        information with the panel in order to help facilitate 
        investigations;
            (3) to expand cooperation with the panel of experts;
            (4) to provide technical assistance to member states to 
        implement United Nations sanctions, including developing the 
        capacity to enforce sanctions through improved export control 
        regulations and customs and border patrol systems;
            (5) to harness existing United States Government 
        initiatives and assistance programs, as appropriate, to improve 
        sanctions implementation and enforcement; and
            (6) to increase outreach to the people of North Korea, and 
        to support independent, non-governmental journalistic, 
        humanitarian, and other institutions engagement in North Korea.
    (d) Report Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the
