                        Secretary of a request for reimbursement for 
                        care or services furnished by an entity to an 
                        eligible veteran under this section is 
                        sufficient to require the Secretary to 
                        reimburse the entity for such care or services, 
                        even if such request for reimbursement does not 
                        include the medical records of the eligible 
                        veteran in connection with such care or 
                        services.
                            ``(ii) Period for payment.--For purposes of 
                        chapter 39 of title 31, United States Code 
                        (commonly referred to as the `Prompt Payment

                        receives a request for reimbursement described 
                        in clause (i), even if such request does not

                        this subparagraph may be construed to eliminate

                        reimbursement for care or services furnished 
                        under this section to submit medical records to
