        requests that such freeze alert be removed before the end of 
        such period, and the agency has received appropriate proof of 
        the identity of the requester for such purpose; and
            ``(2) during the 2-year period beginning on the date of

2018, for each such account for the purposes authorized:  Provided, 
That a request shall be submitted to the Committees on Appropriations 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate for approval prior to 
the expenditure of such funds:  Provided further, That these requests 
shall be made in compliance with reprogramming guidelines outlined in 
section 803 of this Act.
    Sec. 815. (a)(1) During fiscal year 2018, during a period in which 
neither a District of Columbia continuing resolution or a regular

        Columbia appropriation bill for fiscal year 2018.
