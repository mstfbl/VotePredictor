SEC. 103. POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND GUIDANCE.

    The Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) is 
amended by adding after section 3 the following:

``SEC. 3A. POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND GUIDANCE.

    ``(a) Deadline.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection 
Act, the Administrator shall, after providing an opportunity for public 
notice and comment, develop the policies, procedures and guidance

includes any significant written guidance of general applicability 
prepared by the Administrator.
    ``(b) Use of Science.--In establishing any policies, procedures, 
and guidance, on the use of science in making decisions under this 
section and sections 4, 4A, 5, and 6, the Administrator shall have the

        use of peer review, standardized test design and methods, 
        consistent data evaluation procedures, and appropriate 
        laboratory practices will be encouraged;
            ``(3) the names of the organizations or individuals funding 
        the generation and assessment of information and the degree of 
        control they had over the generation, assessment, and

        of the work and the publication of information) will be made 
        clear; and
            ``(4) decisions by the Administrator follow the applicable 
        recommendations in relevant National Academy of Sciences 
        reports, including the reports titled: Science and Decisions:

        National Toxicology Program 12th Report on Carcinogens.
    ``(c) Existing EPA Policies, Procedures and Guidance.--The 
policies, procedures, and guidance described in subsections (a) and (b) 
shall incorporate, as appropriate, existing relevant hazard, exposure, 
and risk assessment guidelines and methodologies, data evaluation and 
quality criteria, testing methodologies and other relevant guidelines 
and policies previously issued by the Administrator.
    ``(d) Review.--Not less than 5 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, and not less frequently than every 5 years thereafter, the 
Administrator shall--
            ``(1) review the adequacy of any policies, procedures, and 
        guidance developed under this section, including procedures for 
        assessing and determining risk under this Act; and

        comment, revise the policies, procedures, and guidance if 
        necessary to reflect new scientific developments or 
        understandings.

to a chemical substance under sections 4, 4A, 5, and 6, the 
Administrator shall consider information on the hazards and exposures 
of a chemical substance under the intended or reasonably foreseeable 
conditions of use that is reasonably available to the Administrator, 
including information that is--
            ``(1) submitted to the Administrator pursuant to any rule, 
        consent agreement, order, or other requirement of this Act, or 
        on a voluntary basis (including pursuant to any request made 
        under this Act) by--

        Administrator of information sources that are publicly 
        available or otherwise accessible by the Administrator.
    ``(f) Testing of Chemical Substances and Mixtures.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall establish 
        policies and procedures for the testing of chemical substances 
        or mixtures under section 4. A goal of the policies and 
        procedures shall be to make the basis of decisions clear to the 
        public.
            ``(2) Contents.--The policies and procedures established 
        under paragraph (1) shall--
                    ``(A) address how and when the exposure level or 
                exposure potential of a chemical substance would factor 
                into decisions to require new testing, provided that 
                the Administrator shall not interpret the lack of 
                exposure information as a lack of exposure or exposure 
                potential and that lack of information on exposure or 
                exposure potential shall not, by itself, be a reason 
                not to require testing;

                that additional testing is needed to carry out this 
                Act, including testing related to potentially exposed 
                or susceptible populations and testing related to the 
                accumulation of chemical substances in the human body;
                    ``(C) require the Administrator to consult with the 
                Director of the National Institute for Occupational 
                Safety and Health prior to prescribing epidemiologic 
                studies of employees; and
                    ``(D) prior to adopting a requirement for testing 
                using mammals, require the Administrator to consider, 
                as appropriate and to the extent practicable, 
                reasonably available--
                            ``(i) toxicity information;
                            ``(ii) computational toxicology and 
                        bioinformatics;

                        and their prediction models; and

                        alternatives to tests on mammals that would 
                        provide equivalent information.
            ``(3) Tiered testing.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
        (C), the Administrator shall employ a tiered screening and 
        testing process, in which the results of screening level tests 
        or assessments of available information inform the decision as 
        to whether 1 or more additional tests are necessary.
                    ``(A) Screening level.--The screening level tests 
                required for a chemical substance or mixture may 
                include tests for hazard (which may include in silico, 
                in vitro, and in vivo tests), environmental and 
                biological fate and transport, and measurements or 
                modeling of exposure, as appropriate. Screening level 
                tests shall be used--
                            ``(i) to screen chemical substances or 
                        mixtures for potential adverse effects; and

                        Administrator whether additional testing is 
                        necessary.
                    ``(B) Additional testing.--If the Administrator 
                determines under subparagraph (A) that additional 
                testing is necessary to provide more definitive 
                information for prioritization or safety assessments 
                and safety determinations, the Administrator may 
                require more advanced tests for potential human health 
                or environmental effects or exposure.
                    ``(C) Advanced testing without screening.--The 
                Administrator may require more advanced testing without 
                conducting screening-level testing when other 
                information available to the Administrator justifies 
                the advanced test, pursuant to policies or procedures 
                developed by the Administrator under this subsection.
    ``(g) Safety Assessments and Safety Determinations.--
            ``(1) Schedule.--The Administrator shall inform the public 
        regarding the schedule for the completion of each safety 
        assessment and safety determination as soon as possible after 
        designation as a high priority substance pursuant to section 
        4A. The time allotted may be different for different chemicals, 
        provided that all schedules shall comply with the deadlines 
        established under section 6.

        safety determinations.--The Administrator shall establish 
        policies and procedures on how the Administrator shall carry 
        out section 6. A goal of the policies and procedures shall be 
        to make the basis of decisions clear to the public. At a 
        minimum, the policies and procedures shall--
