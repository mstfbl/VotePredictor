                  of the fight against breast cancer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer Awareness 
Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) breast cancer is the most common cancer among women of 
        the United States, except for skin cancers;
            (2) today, about 1 in 8, or 12 percent of, women in the 
        United States will develop invasive breast cancer, which is an 
        increase from 1 in 11, or 9 percent of, women in 1975;
            (3) breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
        death in women;
            (4) the chance of dying from breast cancer is about 1 in 
        36;
            (5) thanks to earlier detection, increased awareness, and 
        improved treatment, death rates from breast cancer have 
        decreased since 1989;
            (6) there is a strong interest among the people of the 
        United States to do more to tackle breast cancer;
            (7) the National Cancer Institute estimates that 
        $18,100,000,000 was spent in the United States on breast cancer 
        care in 2014;
            (8) finding a cure for breast cancer is a goal of the 
        United States Government;
            (9) the National Institutes of Health dedicated an 
        estimated $674,000,000 for breast cancer research in fiscal 
        year 2014;
            (10) in fiscal year 2014, the Breast Cancer Research 
        Program of the Department of Defense received $120,000,000;
            (11) while the National Institutes of Health and the 
        Department of Defense program on breast cancer research remain 
        the largest funders of breast cancer research in the United 
        States, funding for the National Cancer Institute was reduced 
        by nearly $66,000,000 between 2011 and 2013;
            (12) the funding level for the Department of Defense Breast 
        Cancer Research Program has remained consistent since 2012, but 
        this amount represents a 20-percent decrease from 2011 funding 
        levels;
            (13) additional private sector support for breast cancer 
        research will help find cures for breast cancer even faster;
            (14) it is estimated that, in the United States, 231,840 
        women will be diagnosed with, and 40,290 women will die of, 
        breast cancer in 2015;
            (15) on average, every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast 
        cancer in the United States;
            (16) due to disease type and lack of adequate care, 
        African-American women have the highest death rates of all 
        racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44-percent 
        more likely to die of breast cancer than women of other racial 
        and ethnic groups;
            (17) breast cancer used to be considered a disease of aging 
        but recent trends show that more aggressive forms of the 
        disease have been increasingly diagnosed in younger women;
            (18) breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer 
        among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including African-
        American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific 
        Islander, and Hispanic/Latina women;
            (19) clinical advances resulting from research have led to 
        increased survival rates from breast cancer;
            (20) since 1990, death rates from breast cancer have 
        dropped more than 34 percent;
            (21) it is estimated that there will be 2,350 new cases of 
        invasive breast cancer and 440 breast cancer deaths among men 
        in the United States in 2015;
            (22) at this time there are more than 3,100,000 breast 
        cancer survivors in the United States;
            (23) it is estimated that breast cancer costs 
        $12,500,000,000 in lost productivity;
            (24) the losses of productivity due to breast cancer will 
        increase with the projected growth rate and aging of the 
        population of the United States if cancer mortality rates stay 
        constant in the future;
            (25) there is a better chance of survival, and there are 
        more treatment options available, with early stage detection 
        through mammograms and clinical breast exams;
            (26) breast cancer is the most common cancer in women 
        worldwide, with an estimated 1,700,000 new cases of breast 
        cancer among women worldwide in 2012;
            (27) the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (hereafter in 
        this Act referred to as ``BCRF'') is considered one of the most 
        efficient cancer research charities;
            (28) of every dollar donated to BCRF, 91 cents goes to 
        research and awareness programs, 88 cents towards research and 
        3 cents towards awareness;
            (29) founded in 1993, BCRF has raised more than 
        $500,000,000 to fuel discoveries in tumor biology, genetics, 
        prevention, treatment, survivorship, and metastasis, making 
        BCRF one of the largest private funders of breast cancer 
        research in the world; and
            (30) in 2014 and 2015, BCRF committed $58,600,000 in 
        research, including $11,600,000 to the international Evelyn H. 
        Lauder Founder's Fund focused on metastasis, to support the 
        work of more than 220 researchers at leading medical 
        institutions across 6 continents, including 25 States and 14 
        countries.
