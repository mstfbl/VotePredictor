                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to provide for a 
 special enrollment period for pregnant women, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Maternity and Obstetric 
Medicine Act'' or the ``Healthy MOM Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pregnancy is a significant life event for millions of 
        women in the United States each year.
            (2) For more than 30 years, our Nation, through the 
        Medicaid program, has recognized that pregnant women need 
        immediate access to affordable care, and has allowed women who 
        meet income-eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid 
        coverage when they become pregnant.
            (3) Congress recognized the central importance of maternity 
        coverage by classifying maternity and newborn care as one of 
        the ten essential health benefits that must now be covered on 
        most individual and small group health insurance plans under 
        section 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1)).
            (4) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has 
        greatly increased access to affordable health insurance 
        coverage for women. Today, more than 7,500,000 women have 
        access to health insurance because of the law. That Act made it 
        illegal to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions, like 
        pregnancy, or charge women more money for their premiums. That 
        Act also required women's preventive services like birth 
        control to be covered without cost sharing.
            (5) Access to comprehensive maternity coverage allows women 
        to access important pregnancy-related care, which is 
        demonstrated to improve health outcomes for women and newborns 
        and reduce financial costs for both consumers and insurers.
            (6) Uninsured women, women with grandfathered and 
        transitional health plans, self-funded student health plans, 
        and catastrophic and high-deductible health plans may lack 
        access to comprehensive and affordable maternity coverage.
            (7) Employer health plans that exclude dependent daughters 
        from maternity coverage leave young women without coverage for 
        their pregnancy, even though Federal law has long held that 
        treating pregnancy differently than other conditions is sex-
        based discrimination.
            (8) A special enrollment period is especially important for 
        young adults, who are at high risk for unintended pregnancies, 
        yet young adults are frequently enrolled in catastrophic 
        coverage, which often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, 
        and higher deductibles.
            (9) Timely maternity care improves the health of pregnant 
        women, as well as birth outcomes and the health of babies 
        throughout their lifetimes. Pregnancy-related maternal 
        mortality is three to four times higher among women who receive 
        no maternity care compared to women who do. Regular maternity 
        care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related health 
        complications, including preeclampsia, placental abruption, 
        complications from diabetes, complications from heart disease, 
        and Graves' disease, all of which can result in morbidity or 
        mortality for the mother or newborn.
            (10) Regular maternity care can reduce preterm births and 
        the health complications associated with preterm births.
            (11) Timely maternity care can reduce short- and long-term 
        health care costs. If a woman does not have access to 
        affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, and she or her 
        newborn experiences pregnancy complications that result in 
        health problems after birth, their insurer may end up paying 
        much higher costs than if the insurer had covered the woman's 
        maternity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity care 
        can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care unit admissions 
        among infants, resulting in cost savings of $1,768 to $5,560 
        per birth. For women with high-risk pregnancies, intensive 
        maternity care saves $1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity 
        care.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect the health of 
women and newborns by ensuring that all women eligible for coverage 
through the Exchanges established under title I of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and women 
eligible for other individual or group health plan coverage can access 
affordable health coverage during their pregnancy.
