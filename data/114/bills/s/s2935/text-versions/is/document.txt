        pursuant to a policy that is set forth in the public housing 
        agency plan under section 5A for the agency or under a policy 
        adopted by the owner. Eligibility criteria for establishing 
        exceptions may provide for separate treatment based on family 
        type and may be based on different factors, such as age, 
        disability, income, the ability of the family to find suitable 
        alternative housing, and whether supportive services are being 
        provided.
