        of subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph: The term `residue'

        liquid, or gaseous form. The term `instruments of international 
        traffic' means containers or holders, capable of and suitable 
        for repeated use, such as lift vans, cargo vans, shipping 
        tanks, skids, pallets, caul boards, and cores for textile 
        fabrics, arriving (whether loaded or empty) in use or to be 
        used in the shipment of merchandise in international traffic, 
        and any additional articles or classes of articles that the 
        Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection designates 
        as instruments of international traffic.''.

effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and apply with respect 
to residue of bulk cargo contained in instruments of international 
traffic that are imported into the customs territory of the United 
States on or after such date of enactment and that previously have been 
exported from the United States.
