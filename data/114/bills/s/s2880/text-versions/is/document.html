                                 A BILL


 
  To prohibit, as an unfair and deceptive act or practice, commercial 
     sexual orientation conversion therapy, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender 
        nonconforming is not a disorder, disease, illness, deficiency, 
        or shortcoming;
            (2) the national community of professionals in education, 
        social work, health, mental health, and counseling has 
        determined that there is no scientifically valid evidence that 
        supports the practice of attempting to prevent a person from 
        being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender 
        nonconforming;
            (3) such professionals have determined that there is no 
        evidence that conversion therapy is effective or that an 
        individual's sexual orientation or gender identity can be 
        changed by conversion therapy;
            (4) such professionals have also determined that the 
        potential risks of conversion therapy are not only that it is 
        ineffective, but also that it is substantially dangerous to an 
        individual's mental and physical health, and has been shown to 
        contribute to depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, family 
        rejection, and suicide; and
            (5) it is in the interest of the Nation to make sure that 
        lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming 
        people and their families are not defrauded by persons seeking 
        to profit by offering this harmful and wholly ineffective 
        therapy.

SEC. 3. UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES RELATED TO CONVERSION 
              THERAPY.

    (a) Unlawful Conduct.--It shall be unlawful for any person--
            (1) to provide conversion therapy to any individual if such 
        person receives monetary compensation in exchange for such 
        services; or
            (2) to advertise for the provision of conversion therapy 
        and claim in such advertising--
                    (A) to change another individual's sexual 
                orientation or gender identity;
                    (B) to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic 
                attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same 
                gender; or
                    (C) that such efforts are harmless or without risk 
                to individuals receiving such therapy.
    (b) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Violation of rule.--A violation of subsection (a) shall 
        be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or 
        deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) 
        of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).
            (2) Powers of commission.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commission shall enforce this 
                section in the same manner, by the same means, and with 
                the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all 
                applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade 
                Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated 
                into and made a part of this Act.
                    (B) Privileges and immunities.--Any person who 
                violates this subsection (a) shall be subject to the

                provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
                41 et seq.).
            (3) Regulations.--The Commission may promulgate, in 
        accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, 
        such regulations as the Commission considers appropriate to 
        carry out this section.
    (c) Enforcement by States.--
            (1) In general.--In any case in which the attorney general 
        of a State has reason to believe that an interest of the 
        residents of the State has been or is threatened or adversely 
        affected by the engagement of any person subject to subsection 
        (a) in a practice that violates such subsection, the attorney 
        general of the State may, as parens patriae, bring a civil 
        action on behalf of the residents of the State in an 
        appropriate district court of the United States to obtain 
        appropriate relief.
            (2) Rights of federal trade commission.--

                            (iii) Exception.--If it is not feasible for 
                        the attorney general of a State to provide the 
                        notification required by clause (i) before 
                        initiating a civil action under paragraph (1), 
                        the attorney general shall notify the

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Conversion therapy.--The term ``conversion therapy''--
                    (A) means any practices or treatments by any person 
                that seek to change another individual's sexual 
                orientation or gender identity, including efforts to 
                change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate 
                or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings 
                toward individuals of the same gender, if such person 
                receives monetary compensation in exchange for such 
                practices or treatments; and
                    (B) does not include practices or treatments that--
                            (i) provide assistance to an individual 
                        undergoing a gender transition; or
                            (ii) provide acceptance, support, and 
                        understanding of a client or facilitation of a 
                        client's coping, social support, and identity 
                        exploration and development, including sexual 
                        orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or

                        practices,
                if such practices or treatments do not seek to change

        the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or other
