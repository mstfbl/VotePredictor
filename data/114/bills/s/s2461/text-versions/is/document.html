SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) nuclear energy, through fission or fusion, represents 
        the highest energy density of any known attainable source and 
        yields low air emissions;
            (2) nuclear energy is of national importance to scientific 
        progress, national security, electricity generation, heat 
        generation for industrial applications, and space exploration; 
        and
            (3) considering the inherent complexity and regulatory 
        burden associated with nuclear energy, the Department should 
        focus civilian nuclear research and development activities of 
        the Department on programs that enable the private sector, 
        National Laboratories, and institutions of higher education to 
        carry out experiments to promote scientific progress and 
        enhance practical knowledge of nuclear engineering.
