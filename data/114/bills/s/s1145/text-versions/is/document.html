representative. If any miner is not currently working in such mine as 
the result of an accident in such mine, but would be currently working 
in such mine but for such accident, such miner may designate such a 
representative. A representative of miners shall have the right to 
participate in any accident investigation the Secretary initiates 
pursuant to subsection (b), including the right to participate in 
investigative interviews and to review all relevant papers, books, 
documents, and records produced in connection with the accident

of section 3(d)) shall be responsible for reporting accidents, 
occupational injuries and illnesses, and man-hours worked for each mine

authority. Such independent contractors shall so report at a frequency

investigations under this section, and during any litigation under this 
Act, no attorney shall represent or purport to represent both the 
operator of a coal or other mine and any other individual, unless such 
individual has knowingly and voluntarily waived all actual and 
reasonably foreseeable conflicts of interest resulting from such 
representation. The Secretary is authorized to take such actions as the 
Secretary considers appropriate to ascertain whether such individual 
has knowingly and voluntarily waived all such conflicts of interest. If 
the Secretary finds that such an individual cannot be represented 
adequately by such an attorney due to such conflicts of interest, the 
Secretary may petition the appropriate United States district court 
which shall have jurisdiction to disqualify such attorney as counsel to 
such individual in the matter. The Secretary may make such a motion as 
part of an ongoing related civil action or as a miscellaneous 
action.''.

that the Commission may assess a penalty for less than the amount that 
would result from the utilization of such methodology if the Commission 
finds that there are extraordinary circumstances. If there is no such 
methodology prescribed for a citation or there are such extraordinary 
circumstances, the Commission shall assess the penalty by

final order. Such pre-final order interest shall be calculated at the 
current underpayment rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and 
shall be compounded daily. Post-final order interest shall begin to

        or other mine fails to pay any civil penalty assessment that

        upon a demonstrated inability to pay, the procedure for 
        entering into such plan, and the consequences of not entering 
        into or not complying with such plan.
            ``(2) Withdrawal orders following failure to pay.--If an 
        operator that receives a letter under paragraph (1) has not 
        paid the assessment by the date that is 180 days after such 
        assessment became a final order and has not entered into a 
        payment plan with the Secretary, the Secretary shall issue an 
        order requiring such operator to cause all persons, except 
        those referred to in section 104(c), to be withdrawn from, and 
        to be prohibited from entering, the mine that is covered by the 
        final order described in paragraph (1), until the operator pays 
        such assessment in full (including interest and administrative 
        costs) or enters into a payment plan with the Secretary. If 
        such operator enters into a payment plan with the Secretary and 
        at any time fails to comply with the terms specified in such 
        payment plan, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring such 
        operator to cause all persons, except those referred to in 
        section 104(c), to be withdrawn from the mine that is covered 
        by such final order, and to be prohibited from entering such 
        mine, until the operator rectifies the noncompliance with the 
        payment plan in the manner specified in such payment plan.''.
            (2) Applicability and effective date.--The amendments made 
        by paragraph (1) shall apply to all unpaid civil penalty 
        assessments under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 
        1977 (30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), except that, for any unpaid civil 
        penalty assessment that became a final order of the Commission 
        or a court before the date of enactment of this Act, the time 
        periods under section 110(l) of the Federal Mine Safety and 
        Health Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 820(l)), as so amended, shall be 
        calculated as beginning on the date of enactment of this Act 
        instead of on the date of the final order.

constructively discharge a miner employed at such mine without 
reasonable grounds based on a failure of such miner to satisfactorily 
perform the duties required for work as a miner, including compliance 
with the provisions of this Act, regulations promulgated under this 
Act, mandatory health or safety standards under any other law, or any 
other legitimate business reason, if--

Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust 
Monitors'', published at 79 Fed. Reg. 24814 (May 1, 2014), and evaluate

        included in such final rule should be further lowered to better 
        protect the health of miners;

        monitors should be increased;
            (3) engineering controls and work practices used by mine 
        operators to achieve and maintain the required respirable coal 
        mine dust levels should be modified; and
            (4) samples taken on shifts longer than 8 hours should be 
        converted to an 8-hour equivalent concentration to protect 
        miners who work longer shifts.

        States district court for the district in which the violation 
        was found to occur to enforce such order. If both the Secretary 
        and the complainant file such action, the action of the

                        such decision within 30 days, the decision of 
                        the administrative law judge shall become a

correction (and a stay has not been issued by the Commission under 
section 10(d)) may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $7,000 
for each day during which such failure or violation continues. Any 
employer who fails to correct any other violation for which a citation 
has been issued under section 9(a) of this title within the period 
permitted for its correction (which period shall not begin to run until 
the date of the final order of the Commission in the case of any review 
proceeding under section 10 initiated by the employer in good faith and 
not solely for delay of avoidance of penalties) may be assessed a civil 
penalty of not more than $7,000 for each day during which such failure 
or violation continues.''.

                safety and health plans established under section 18. 
                If such a willful or repeated violation caused or 
                contributed to the death of an employee, such civil 
                penalty amounts shall be increased to not more than 
                $250,000 for each such violation, but not less than
