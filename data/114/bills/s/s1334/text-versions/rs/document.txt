    (a) Submission of Information Required Under Agreement.--All 
foreign vessels seeking entry to a port subject to the jurisdiction of

Agreement in advance of its arrival in port.

        subsection (b);
            (2) the vessel is a listed IUU vessel;
            (3) the flag nation of the vessel has failed to provide 
        confirmation requested by the Secretary that the fish on board 
        were taken in accordance with applicable RFMO conservation and 
        management measures; or
            (4) the Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe--
                    (A) the vessel lacks valid authorizations to engage 
                in fishing or fishing-related activities as required by 
                its flag nation or the relevant coastal nation;
                    (B) the fish on board were taken in violation of 
                foreign law or in contravention of any RFMO 
                conservation and management measure; or
                    (C) the vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or 
                fishing-related activities in support of such fishing, 
                including in support of a listed IUU vessel, unless it 
                can establish that--
                            (i) it was acting in a manner consistent 
                        with applicable RFMO conservation and

                        personnel, fuel, gear, and other supplies at 
                        sea, the vessel provisioned was not, at the 
                        time of provisioning, a listed IUU vessel.
    (d) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), the 
Secretary may allow port entry or the use of port services--
            (1) if they are essential to the safety or health of the 
        crew or safety of the vessel;
            (2) to allow, where appropriate, for the scrapping of the 
        vessel; or
            (3) pursuant to an inspection or other enforcement action.

SEC. 306. INSPECTIONS.

    The Secretary, and the Secretary of the department in which the 
Coast Guard is operating, shall conduct foreign vessel inspections in

achieve the purposes of the Agreement and this title. If, following an 
inspection, the Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe that a 
foreign vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing-related activities

under this title or other applicable law, and shall deny the vessel the 
use of port services, in accordance with section 305.

        respect to enforcement of this title.
            (2) Included vessels.--For purposes of enforcing this 
        title, any reference in such paragraphs and subsections to a 
        ``vessel'' or ``fishing vessel'' includes all vessels as 
        defined in section 303 of this title.
            (3) Application of other provisions.--Such paragraphs and

                    (A) In general.--Any person who is found by the 
                Secretary (after notice and opportunity for a hearing 
                in accordance with section 554 of title 5, United 
                States Code) to have committed an act prohibited under 
                section 307 shall be liable to the United States for a 
                civil penalty. The amount of the civil penalty shall be 
                consistent with the amount under section 308(a) of the 
                Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1858(a)).
                    (B) Compromise or other action by secretary.--The 
                Secretary shall have the same authority as provided in 
                section 308(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 
                1858(e)) with respect to a violation of this Act.
            (2) In rem jurisdiction.--For purposes of this title, the 
        conditions for in rem liability shall be consistent with 
        section 308(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U.S.C. 1858(d)).
            (3) Action upon failure to pay assessment.--If any person 
        fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty under this title 
        after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after 
        the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of 
        the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the 
        Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed in any 
        appropriate district court of the United States. In such 
        action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order 
        imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.
    (c) Forfeiture.--
            (1) In general.--Any foreign vessel (including its fishing 
        gear, furniture, appurtenances, stores, and cargo) used, and 
        any fish (or the fair market value thereof) imported or 
        possessed in connection with or as result of the commission of 
        any act prohibited by section 307 of this title shall be 
        subject to forfeiture under section 310 of the Magnuson-Stevens 
        Act (16 U.S.C. 1860).
            (2) Application of the customs laws.--All provisions of law 
        relating to seizure, summary judgment, and judicial forfeiture 
        and condemnation for violation of the customs laws, the 
        disposition of the property forfeited or condemned or the 
        proceeds from the sale thereof, the remission or mitigation of 
        such forfeitures, and the compromise of claims shall apply to 
        seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been 
        incurred, under the provisions of this title, insofar as 
        applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. For 
        seizures and forfeitures of property under this section by the 
        Secretary, such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer 
        or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture 
        of property under the customs law may be performed by such 
        officers as are designated by the Secretary or, upon request of 
        the Secretary, by any other agency that has authority to manage 
        and dispose of seized property.
            (3) Presumption.--For the purposes of this section there is 
        a rebuttable presumption that all fish, or components thereof, 
        found on board a vessel that is used or seized in connection 
        with a violation of this title (including any regulation 
        promulgated under this Act) were taken, obtained, or retained 
        as a result of IUU fishing or fishing-related activities in 
        support of IUU fishing.
    (d) Criminal Enforcement.--Any person (other than a foreign 
government agency, or entity wholly owned by a foreign government) who 
knowingly commits an act prohibited by section 307 shall be subject to 
subsections (b) and (c) of section 309 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 
U.S.C. 1859).
    (e) Payment of Storage, Care, and Other Costs.--Any person assessed 
a civil penalty for, or convicted of, any violation of this title 
(including any regulation promulgated under this title) and any 
claimant in a forfeiture action brought for such a violation, shall be 
liable for the reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in storage, 
care, and maintenance of any property seized in connection with the 
violation.

SEC. 309. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Assistance to Developing Nations and International 
Organizations.--Consistent with existing authority and the availability 
of funds, the Secretary shall provide appropriate assistance to 
developing nations and international organizations of which such 
nations are members to assist those nations in meeting their 
obligations under the Agreement.
    (b) Personnel, Services, Equipment, and Facilities.--In carrying 
out subsection (a), the Secretary may, by agreement, on a reimbursable 
or nonreimbursable basis, utilize the personnel, services, equipment, 
and facilities of any Federal, State, local, or foreign government or 
any entity of any such government.

SEC. 310. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.

    (a) In General.--Nothing in this title shall be construed to 
displace any requirements imposed by the customs laws of the United 
States or any other laws or regulations enforced or administered by the 
Secretary of Homeland Security. Where more stringent requirements 
regarding port entry or access to port services exist under other 
Federal law, those more stringent requirements shall apply. Nothing in 
this title shall affect a vessel's entry into port, in accordance with 
international law, for reasons of force majeure or distress.
    (b) United States Obligations Under International Law.--This title 
shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with United States 
obligations under international law.
