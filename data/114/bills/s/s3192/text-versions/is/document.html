SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that Alex Diekmann--
            (1) was a loving father of two and an adoring husband who 
        lived in Bozeman, Montana, where he was a renowned 
        conservationist who dedicated his career to protecting some of 
        the most outstanding natural and scenic resource areas of the 
        Northern Rockies;
            (2) was responsible during his unique conservation career 
        for the protection of more than 50 distinct areas in the States 
        of Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, conserving for the public over 
        100,000 acres of iconic mountains and valleys, rivers and 
        creeks, ranches and farms, and historic sites and open spaces;
            (3) played a central role in securing the future of an 
        array of special landscapes, including--
                    (A) the spectacular Devil's Canyon in the Craig 
                Thomas Special Management Area in the State of Wyoming;
                    (B) crucial fish and wildlife habitat and 
                recreation access land in the Sawtooth Mountains of 
                Idaho, along the Salmon River, and near the Canadian 
                border; and
                    (C) diverse and vitally important land all across 
                the Crown of the Continent in the State of Montana, 
                from the world-famous Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to 
                Glacier National Park to the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem, to 
                the recreational trails, working forests and ranches, 
                and critical drinking water supply for Whitefish, and 
                beyond;
            (4) made a particularly profound mark on the preservation 
        of the natural wonders in and near the Madison Valley and the 
        Madison Range, Montana, where more than 12 miles of the Madison 
        River and much of the world-class scenery, fish and wildlife, 
        and recreation opportunities of the area have become and shall 
        remain conserved and available to the public because of his 
        efforts;
            (5) inspired others with his skill, passion, and spirit of 
        partnership that brought together communities, landowners, 
        sportsmen, and the public at large;
            (6) lost a heroic battle with cancer on February 1, 2016, 
        at the age of 52;
            (7) is survived by his wife, Lisa, and their 2 sons, Logan 
        and Liam; and
            (8) leaves a lasting legacy across Montana and the Northern 
        Rockies that will benefit all people of the United States in 
        our time and in the generations to follow.
