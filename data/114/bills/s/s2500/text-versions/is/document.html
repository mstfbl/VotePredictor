                consumers in the State, in coordination with the 
                Department of Health and Human Services. Such 
                activities may include the provision of direct 
                assistance to consumers in the form of tax credits to

        carry out this section or other programs to support the 
        subsidized, affordable purchase of private health insurance 
        coverage, notwithstanding the Consolidated and Further 
        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-235).''.
