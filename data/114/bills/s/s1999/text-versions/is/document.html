SEC. 101. DEFINITION OF VESSEL.

    For the purposes of this title, the term ``vessel'' means every 
description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used or 
capable of being used, whether such capability is practical or not, as 
a means of transportation on water, and includes structures, fixed or 
floating, which dynamically hold position or are attached to the seabed 
or subsoil and are capable of exploring for, drilling for, developing, 
or producing crude oil or natural gas.

SEC. 102. GRAVE AND IMMINENT DANGER TO WATERS, COASTLINE, OR RELATED 
              INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) In General.--Whenever an incident, activity, or occurrence 
involving a vessel in waters beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the 
United States creates a grave and imminent threat, as determined by the 
Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, of 
damage to the waters, coastline, or related interests of the United 
States from pollution of the sea by crude oil, the Secretary of the 
department in which the Coast Guard is operating may, without liability 
for any damage to the owner, operator, crew, or underwriter of the 
vessel, or any other interested party, act in such waters to prevent or 
respond to that threat.
    (b) Criteria.--In determining whether there is a grave and imminent 
threat of damage to the waters, coastline, or related interests of the 
United States under subsection (a), the Secretary of the department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating shall consider the interests of the 
United States directly threatened or affected, including impacts on--
            (1) the health of coastal communities;
            (2) finfish, shellfish, marine mammals, and other living 
        marine resources;
            (3) coastal zone and estuarine activities;
            (4) public and private shorelines and beaches; and

or without continuing any consultations previously initiated under that 
section.

that threat.
    (b) Considerations.--In considering whether an action is 
proportionate to the threat of damage the Secretary of the department
