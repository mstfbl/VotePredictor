                                 A BILL


 
To establish in the United States Agency for International Development 
an entity to be known as the United States Global Development Lab, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Development Lab Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The effectiveness of United States foreign assistance 
        can be greatly enhanced by fostering innovation, applying 
        science and technology, and leveraging the expertise and 
        resources of the private sector to find low-cost, common sense 
        solutions to today's most pressing development challenges.
            (2) Breakthroughs that accelerate economic growth and 
        produce better health outcomes in developing countries can help 
        support the growth of healthier, more stable societies and 
        foster trade relationships that translate into jobs and 
        economic growth in the United States.
            (3) In 2014, the Office of Science and Technology and the 
        Office of Innovation and Development Alliances at the United 
        States Agency for International Development (USAID) were 
        streamlined and merged into the United States Global 
        Development Lab.
            (4) The Lab partners with entrepreneurs, experts, 
        nongovernmental organizations, universities, and science and 
        research institutions to find solutions to specific development 
        challenges in a faster, more cost-efficient, and more 
        sustainable way.
            (5) The Lab utilizes competitive innovation incentive 
        awards, a ``pay-for-success'' model, whereby a development 
        challenge is identified, competitions are launched, ideas with 
        the greatest potential for success are selected and tested, and 
        awards are provided only after the objectives of a competition 
        have been substantially achieved.
            (6) Enhancing the authorities that support this pay-for-
        success model will better enable the Lab to diversify and 
        expand both the number and sources of ideas that may be 
        developed, tested, and brought to scale, thereby increasing 
        USAID's opportunity to apply high value, low-cost solutions to 
        specific development challenges.
