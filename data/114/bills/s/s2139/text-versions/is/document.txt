                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Small Business Act to prohibit the use of reverse auctions 
               for the procurement of covered contracts.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Contractors Improve 
Competition Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE AUCTIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, when used 
appropriately, reverse auctions may improve procurement by the Federal 
Government of commercially available commodities by increasing 
competition, reducing prices, and improving opportunities for small 
businesses.

U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 47 as section 48; and
            (2) by inserting after section 46 the following:

        offeror submitted in relation to offers submitted by other 
        offerors.
            ``(6) Use of third-party agents.--If a Federal agency uses 
        a third-party agent to assist with the award of such a contract 
        using a reverse auction, the Federal agency shall ensure that--
                    ``(A) inherently governmental functions are not 
                performed by private contractors, including by the 
                third-party agent;

                the offeror and complies with section 8(b)(7); and
                    ``(D) disputes between the third-party agent and an 
                offeror may not be used to justify a determination that 
                an offeror is not a responsible source or to otherwise 
                restrict the ability of an offeror to compete for the 
                award of a contract or task.''.
