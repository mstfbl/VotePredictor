SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is 
        vital to the public health, public confidence in the food 
        supply, and the success of the food sector of the economy of 
        the United States;
            (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and the 
        loss of public confidence that results from foodborne illness 
        outbreaks and food recalls are damaging to consumers and the 
        food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce and 
        international trade;
            (3) the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the 
        Department of Agriculture has jurisdiction over meat, poultry, 
        and egg products;
            (4)(A) events recent to the date of enactment of this Act 
        demonstrate that the food safety system administered by the 
        Food Safety and Inspection Service is not effective in 
        controlling risk in regulated food; and
            (B) these events have adversely affected consumer 
        confidence; and
            (5) improving Federal oversight of food safety requires a 
        modern food safety mandate and clear authorities to effectively 
        protect the public from foodborne diseases associated with the 
        products that the Food Safety and Inspection Service regulates.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to establish an effective, preventive food safety 
        system administered by the Food Safety and Inspection Service--
                    (A) to regulate food safety and strengthen the 
                protection of the public health; and
                    (B) to make more effective and efficient use of 
                resources to prevent foodborne illness; and
            (2) to establish that food establishments have 
        responsibility to ensure that all stages of production, 
        processing, and distribution of the products of the food 
        establishments, or under the control of the food 
        establishments, satisfy the requirements of this Act.
