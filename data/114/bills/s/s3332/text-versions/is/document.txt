   To provide appropriate information to Federal law enforcement and 
  intelligence agencies, pursuant to investigating terrorism, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Terror Intelligence Improvement Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On June 12, 2016, the deadliest terrorist attack on our 
        homeland since September 11, 2001, occurred at the Pulse Bar 
        and Club in downtown Orlando, Florida. The Orlando Police 
        Department shortly after the incident reported 49 fatalities 
        and 53 injured.
            (2) On June 13, 2016, the Washington Post reported that the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated the Orlando 
        shooter for 10 months beginning in 2013, putting him under 
        surveillance, recording his calls and using confidential 
        informants to gauge whether he had been radicalized after the 
        suspect talked at work about his connections with al-Qaeda and 
        dying as a martyr.
            (3) On June 13, 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
        remarked that the suspect had made clear his affinity, at the 
        time of the attack, for the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant (commonly known as ``ISIL''), and generally, leading up 
        to the attack, for radical Islamist groups.
            (4) On June 12, 2016, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
        Firearms, and Explosives announced it had completed a trace of 
        the firearms used in the shooting and determined both were 
        purchased legally.
