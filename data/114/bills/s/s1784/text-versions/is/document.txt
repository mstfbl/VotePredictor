SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons leads a law 
        enforcement component of the Department of Justice with a 
        budget that exceeds $6,900,000,000 for fiscal year 2015.
            (2) With the exception of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, the Bureau of Prisons has the largest operating 
        budget of any unit within the Department of Justice.
            (3) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons oversees 122 
        facilities and is responsible for the welfare of more than 
        208,000 Federal inmates.
            (4) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons supervises more 
        than 39,000 employees, many of whom operate in hazardous 
        environments that involve regular interaction with violent 
        offenders.
            (5) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons also serves as 
        the chief operating officer for Federal Prisons Industries, a 
        wholly owned Government enterprise of 78 prison factories that 
        directly competes against the private sector, including small 
        businesses, for Government contracts.
            (6) Within the Department of Justice, in addition to those 
        officials who oversee litigating components, the Director of 
        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the 
        Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, the Director of 
        the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Director of the Community 
        Relations Service, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, the Director of the National Institute of 
        Justice, the Director of the Office for Victims of Crime, the

        the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
        Delinquency Prevention, the Director of the United States 
        Marshals Service, 94 United States Marshals, the Inspector 
        General of the Department of Justice, and the Special Counsel 
        for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices, are all 
        appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent 
        of the Senate.
            (7) Despite the significant budget of the Bureau of Prisons 
        and the vast number of people under the responsibility of the 
        Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director is not 
        appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
