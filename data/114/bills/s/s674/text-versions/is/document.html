        to improve the quality and outcomes of maternity care for 
        vulnerable populations.

        effectiveness of interventions to reduce disparities in 
        maternity services and outcomes, and implement and assessing 
        effective interventions.

        variety of type of models are tested through the demonstration 
        project and that such models include interventions that have an 
        existing evidence base for effectiveness; and
            ``(4) criteria designed by the Secretary to assure that the 
        demonstration projects and models will be carried out in

        such as community health centers, hospital systems, and medical 
        societies representing providers of maternity services.
