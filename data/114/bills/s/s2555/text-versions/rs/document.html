&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, including an opportunity for public comment, the 
Commission, in collaboration with the NTIA, shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) conduct a bidirectional sharing study to 
        determine the best means of providing Federal entities flexible 
        access to non-Federal spectrum on a shared basis across a range 
        of short-, mid-, and long-range timeframes, including for 
        intermittent purposes like emergency use; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) submit to Congress a report on the study under 
        paragraph (1), including any recommendations for legislation or 
        proposed regulations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study under 
subsection (a), the Commission shall consider how to balance the 
regulatory certainty that commercial spectrum users and Federal 
entities need to make longer-term investment decisions for shared 
access to be viable.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 12. UNLICENSED SERVICES IN GUARD BANDS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--After a feasibility assessment and public 
notice and comment, and in consultation with the Secretary and the head 
of each affected Federal agency (or a designee thereof), the Commission 
shall adopt rules that permit unlicensed services where feasible to use 
any frequencies that are designated as guard bands to protect 
frequencies allocated after the date of enactment of this Act by 
competitive bidding under section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 
1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), including spectrum that acts as a duplex gap 
between transmit and receive frequencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Limitation.--The Commission may not permit any use of 
a guard band under this section that would cause harmful interference 
to a licensed service or a Federal service operating in the guard band 
or in an adjacent band.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed as limiting the Commission or the Secretary from making 
spectrum available for licensed or unlicensed use under section 3 or 
available for unlicensed use in any spectrum band under existing rules 
and regulations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                Telecommunications and Information Administration 
                Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(h)) to accept payments 
                could result in access to the eligible frequencies that 
                are being reallocated for exclusive non-Federal use or 
                shared use sooner than would otherwise occur without 
                such payments; and
                    (B) include the findings under subparagraph (A), 
                including the analysis under paragraph (2) and any

SEC. 12. UNLICENSED SERVICES IN GUARD BANDS.

    (a) In General.--After public notice and comment, and in 
consultation with the Secretary and the head of each affected Federal 
agency (or a designee thereof), with respect to frequencies allocated 
for Federal use, the Commission shall adopt rules that permit 
unlicensed services where feasible to use any frequencies that are 
designated as guard bands to protect frequencies allocated after the 
date of enactment of this Act by competitive bidding under section 
309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 309(j)), including 
spectrum that acts as a duplex gap between transmit and receive 
frequencies.
    (b) Limitation.--The Commission may not permit any use of a guard 
band under this section that would cause harmful interference to a 
licensed service or a Federal service operating in the guard band or in 
an adjacent band.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as limiting the Commission or the Secretary from otherwise 
making spectrum available for licensed or unlicensed use in any 
frequency band in addition to guard bands, including under section 3, 
consistent with their statutory jurisdictions.

                        entity that is incurring relocation or sharing 
                        costs to accommodate sharing spectrum 
                        frequencies with another Federal entity, after

        the goals described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection 
        (a)(2).

SEC. 17. RULEMAKING RELATED TO PARTITIONING OR DISAGGREGATING LICENSES.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) Covered small carrier.--The term ``covered small 
        carrier'' means a carrier (as defined in section 3 of the 
        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153)) that--
                    (A) has not more than 1,500 employees (as 
                determined under section 121.106 of title 13, Code of 
                Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto); and

    (b) Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall initiate a 
        rulemaking proceeding to assess whether to establish a program, 
        or modify existing programs, under which a licensee that 
        receives a license for the exclusive use of spectrum in a 
        specific geographic area under section 301 of the 
        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301) may partition or 
        disaggregate the license by sale or long-term lease--
                    (A) in order to--
                            (i) provide services consistent with the 
                        license; and
                            (ii) make unused spectrum available to--
                                    (I) an unaffiliated covered small 
                                carrier; or
                                    (II) an unaffiliated carrier to 
                                serve a rural area; and
                    (B) if the Commission finds that such a program 
                would promote--
                            (i) the availability of advanced 
                        telecommunications services in rural areas; or
                            (ii) spectrum availability for covered 
                        small carriers.
            (2) Considerations.--In conducting the rulemaking 
        proceeding under paragraph (1), the Commission shall consider, 
        with respect to the program proposed to be established under 
        that paragraph--
                    (A) whether reduced performance requirements with 
                respect to spectrum obtained through the program would 
                facilitate deployment of advanced telecommunications 
                services in the areas covered by the program;
                    (B) what conditions may be needed on transfers of 
                spectrum under the program to allow covered small 
                carriers that obtain spectrum under the program to 
                build out the spectrum in a reasonable period of time;
                    (C) what incentives may be appropriate to encourage 
                licensees to lease or sell spectrum, including--
                            (i) extending the term of a license granted 
                        under section 301 of the Communications Act of 
                        1934 (47 U.S.C. 301); or
                            (ii) modifying performance requirements of 
                        the license relating to the leased or sold 
                        spectrum; and
                    (D) the administrative feasibility of--
                            (i) the incentives described in 
                        subparagraph (C); and
                            (ii) other incentives considered by the 
                        Commission that further the goals of this 
                        section.
            (3) Forfeiture of spectrum.--If a party fails to meet any 
        build out requirements set by the Commission for any spectrum 
        sold or leased under this section, the right to the spectrum 
        shall be forfeited to the Commission unless the Commission 
        finds that there is good cause for the failure of the party.
            (4) Requirement.--The Commission may offer a licensee 
        incentives or reduced performance requirements under this 
        section only if the Commission finds that doing so would likely 
        result in increased availability of advanced telecommunications 
        services in a rural area.

SEC. 18. UNLICENSED SPECTRUM POLICY.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to maximize the benefit to the people of the United
