SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States policy of principled engagement since 
        1988 has fostered positive democratic reforms in Burma, which 
        have led to significant milestones on the road to full 
        democracy.
            (2) On November 8, 2015, Burma held historic elections in 
        which the National League for Democracy won a supermajority of 
        seats in the combined national parliament.
            (3) On March 30, 2016, Htin Kyaw was inaugurated as the 
        President of Burma, the country's first civilian President in 
        more than 50 years, and Aung Sann Suu Kyi assumed the office of 
        State Counselor. Aung San Suu Kyi, President of the National 
        League for Democracy, was barred from becoming President under 
        section 59(f) of the 2008 Constitution.
            (4) Aung San Suu Kyi's first acts as State Counselor after 
        her National League for Democracy party took office included 
        releasing more than 100 political prisoners, including well-
        known journalists and student activists held on politically 
        motivated charges. However, as of July 31, 2016, 118 political 
        prisoners remained in jails in Burma, and another 167 people 
        were awaiting trial for political expression.
            (5) Despite the important steps taken toward democracy in 
        Burma, there still remain important structural and systemic 
        impediments to the realization of a fully democratic civilian 
        government, including--
                    (A) reform of the 2008 Constitution;
                    (B) the disfranchisement of groups of people who 
                voted in previous elections; and
                    (C) social, political and economic conditions in 
                Rakhine State, particularly those faced by the Rohingya 
                population.
            (6) Actions of the military of Burma, known as the 
        Tatmadaw, including continuing assaults on personnel and 
        territory controlled by armed ethnic organizations, military 
        offenses immediately preceding the peace conference in 
        Naypyitaw, and alleged human rights abuses against noncombatant 
        civilians in conflict areas, undermine confidence in 
        establishing a credible nationwide cease-fire agreement ending 
        Burma's civil war.
            (7) The United States supports a peaceful, prosperous, and 
        democratic Burma that respects the human rights of all its 
        people. The inauguration of President Htin Kyaw, and the 
        formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government 
        were momentous steps for the democratic transition of Burma and 
        the United States seeks to build and capitalize on that 
        success.
            (8) The United States supports Burma's political and 
        economic reforms, including efforts to--
                    (A) promote national reconciliation;
                    (B) build government transparency and 
                accountability and government institutions;
                    (C) empower local communities and civil society;
                    (D) promote responsible international engagement; 
                and
                    (E) strengthen respect for and protection of human 
                rights and religious freedom.
            (9) On March 17, 2016, the Department of State determined 
        that Burma remains designated as a country of particular 
        concern for religious freedom under section 402(b) of the 
        International Religious Freedom Act (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)), and 
        that ``members of the Rohingya community in particular 
        reportedly face abuses by the Government of Burma, including 
        those involving torture, unlawful arrest and detention, 
        restricted movement, restrictions on religious practices and 
        discrimination in employment and access to social services''.
            (10) On August 23, 2016, the Government of Burma announced 
        the establishment of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, 
        which will be chaired by former Secretary-General of the United 
        Nations Kofi Annan.
            (11) On May 17, 2016, the United States announced a 
        calibrated easing of sanctions with respect to Burma by 
        removing individuals and entities from the list of specially 
        designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the 
        Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the 
        Treasury and renewing authorities for sanctions with respect to 
        Burma as provided under the International Emergency Economic 
        Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).
            (12) In 2015, the nongovernmental campaign Global Witness 
        found that in 2014 the estimated value of official production 
        of jade equated up to 48 percent of the official gross domestic 
        product of Burma, but because of corruption and a lack of 
        transparency the economic gains of Burma are being pocketed by 
        notorious junta-era players, from former dictator Than Shwe to 
        United States-sanctioned drug lord Wei Hsueh Kang, and showed 
        how vested interests in jade are undermining prospects for 
        resolving the most intractable armed conflict in Burma.
            (13) In July 2016, the Government of Burma announced that 
        all remaining jade mining licenses will expire in 2018, and no 
        new permits will be granted until a reformed legal framework is 
        in place.
            (14) In July 2016, the Government of Burma also announced 
        that logging would be prohibited in major forested areas for 
        the rest of the year.
            (15) The people of Burma continue to suffer from a low 
        grade civil war between the Tatmadaw and nearly 20 armed ethnic 
        organizations.
            (16) Any prospects for a full democracy in Burma are 
        contingent on ending the civil war and finding a path toward 
        national reconciliation between Burma's Bamar majority and its 
        various ethnic minorities.
            (17) On August 31, 2016, the Government of Burma initiated 
        the Union Peace Conference 21st Century Panglong, where more 
        than 1,400 representatives of various concerned parties 
        attended a peace conference in Naypyitaw in an effort to begin 
        the process of ending Burma's civil war and discuss options in 
        forming a democratic state of Burma.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States that--
            (1) the pursuit of a calibrated engagement strategy is 
        essential to support a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic 
        Burma that respects the human rights of all its people 
        regardless of ethnicity and religion;
            (2) the guiding principles of such a strategy to support 
        and complete the transition to democracy and genuine national

                reforms;
                    (B) the establishment of a fully democratic and

                elections;
                    (C) the promotion of genuine national

        senior military figures and their associates (both directly and

        risk-based due diligence on their gemstone supply chains, to 
        help such entities fulfil their responsibility to respect human

        conflict through their sourcing decisions, including the choice 
        of their suppliers.

        ownership information, contract terms, and gemstone sales and 
        revenue payments broken down by project.
            (4) A plan to ensure licenses to export jadeite and rubies 
        contain adequate safeguards against conflicts of interest and 
        corruption and take into account bidder histories, including 
        credible allegations of links to the military junta, narcotics 
        trade, human rights abuses, or adverse social or environmental 
        impacts.
            (5) A plan to ensure that ethnic reconciliation and peace 
        negotiations include a process to achieve consensus over 
        resource sharing of jadeite, rubies, and other gemstones that 
        takes into account community concerns with respect to equity, 
        responsibility, and transparency management, and the 
        sustainability of production and environmental and social 
        impacts.
            (6) A plan to assist the Government of Burma in the 
        governance of the gemstones industry, including building 
        necessary capacity, legal structures, auditing and financial 
        structures, evaluation of remaining reserves, and other
