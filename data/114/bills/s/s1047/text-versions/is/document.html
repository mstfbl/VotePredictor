standards of the Department of Energy.
    (b) Consultation.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall consult with the head 
        of each relevant Federal agency to identify any areas of 
        conflict or overlap between a proposed or final regulation, 
        guideline, or standard of the Department of Energy and a 
        proposed or final regulation, guideline, or standard of that 
        relevant Federal agency.
            (2) Public input.--The Secretary shall seek public input on 
        any conflicts or overlaps identified under paragraph (1).
    (c) Resolution of Conflict.--For cases in which a conflicting or 
overlapping proposed regulation, guideline, or standard has been 
identified under subsection (b), prior to finalizing the rulemaking, 
the Secretary shall work with the head of the relevant Federal agency 
and the public, including small businesses, to resolve the conflict or 
overlap, in order to ensure that the regulatory conflict or overlap 
does not pose an undue compliance burden on the regulated persons.
