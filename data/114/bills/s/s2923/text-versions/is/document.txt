                                 A BILL


 
To redesignate the Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site as the ``Saint-
     Gaudens National Park for the Arts'', and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saint-Gaudens National Park for the 
Arts Redesignation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Augustus Saint-Gaudens was one of the greatest 
        sculptors in the United States, creating well-known public 
        monuments to Civil War heroes, peerless bas-reliefs, and the 
        1907 United States gold coinage, which are considered to be the 
        most beautiful coins ever minted;
            (2) from 1885 until the death of Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 
        1907, Augustus Saint-Gaudens maintained a residence and studios 
        in Cornish, New Hampshire, where many of the most famous works 
        of Augustus Saint-Gaudens were created and perfected;
            (3) the presence of Saint-Gaudens in Cornish, New 
        Hampshire, attracted leaders and practitioners in painting, 
        sculpture, etching, writing, poetry, drama, dance, musical 
        composition, musical performance, architecture, landscape 
        architecture, jurisprudence, politics, and other artistic 
        disciplines to relocate to Cornish, forming the Cornish Art 
        Colony, which was--
                    (A) one of the earliest art colonies; and
                    (B) one of the richest and most diverse 
                concentrations of practicing artists in the United 
                States;
            (4) the core of the Cornish Art Colony is currently 
        preserved at Aspet, the estate of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and 
        at the Blow-Me-Down Farm, which served as a social hub for the 
        Colony, both of which are part of the Saint-Gaudens National 
        Historic Site; and
            (5) throughout the long history of the Saint-Gaudens 
        National Historic Site, the Historic Site and the partner 
        organization of the Historic Site, the Saint-Gaudens Memorial, 
        have promoted the arts through the regular presentation of 
        musical concerts, historical dramas, visual arts exhibitions, 
        artistic workshops, and the oldest artist-in-residence program 
        in the National Park Service, creating a vibrant artistic 
        community that promotes the creation, performance, and 
        interpretation of the artistic heritage of the United States.
