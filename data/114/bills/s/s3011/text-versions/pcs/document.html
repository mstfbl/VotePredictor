                    Subtitle F--Administrative Leave

SEC. 1601. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Administrative Leave Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 1602. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) agency use of administrative leave, and leave that is 
        referred to incorrectly as administrative leave in agency 
        recording practices, has exceeded reasonable amounts--
                    (A) in contravention of--
                            (i) established precedent of the 
                        Comptroller General of the United States; and
                            (ii) guidance provided by the Office of 
                        Personnel Management; and
                    (B) resulting in significant cost to the Federal 
                Government;
            (2) administrative leave should be used sparingly;
            (3) prior to the use of paid leave to address personnel 
        issues, an agency should consider other actions, including--
                    (A) temporary reassignment;
                    (B) transfer; and
                    (C) telework;
            (4) an agency should prioritize and expeditiously conclude 
        an investigation in which an employee is placed in 
        administrative leave so that, not later than the conclusion of 
        the leave period--
                    (A) the employee is returned to duty status; or
                    (B) an appropriate personnel action is taken with 
                respect to the employee;
            (5) data show that there are too many examples of employees 
        placed in administrative leave for 6 months or longer, leaving 
        the employees without any available recourse to--
                    (A) return to duty status; or
                    (B) challenge the decision of the agency;
            (6) an agency should ensure accurate and consistent 
        recording of the use of administrative leave so that 
        administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; 
        and
            (7) other forms of excused absence authorized by law should 
        be recorded separately from administrative leave, as defined by 
        the amendments made by this subtitle.

       Subtitle M--Construction Consensus Procurement Improvement

SEC. 1981. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Construction Consensus 
Procurement Improvement Act of 2016''.

SEC. 1982. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The acquisition procedures that are often used 
        effectively to procure products and other forms of services are 
        not always appropriate for procurement of design and 
        construction services.
            (2) Federal procurement officials often adopt contracting 
        techniques from the private sector and have used those 
        techniques effectively to procure products and services.
            (3) Design-build is a procurement technique Federal 
        officials have adopted from the private sector that has worked 
        well for procurement of design and construction services.
            (4) The current statutory framework for design-build could 
        benefit from legislative refinement.
            (5) Reverse auctions are another procurement technique 
        Federal officials have adopted from the private sector and used 
        successfully to award contracts for the purchase of products 
        that are commercially equivalent to commodities.
            (6) Despite their success in other contexts, reverse 
        auctions are generally inappropriate for procurement of design 
        and construction services, given the unique nature of each such 
        project.

SEC. 1983. DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IMPROVEMENT.

    (a) Civilian Contracts.--
            (1) In general.--Section 3309(b) of title 41, United States 
        Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Criteria for Use.--
            ``(1) Contracts with a value of at least $750,000.--Two-

        the project has a value of $750,000 or greater, as adjusted for 
        inflation in accordance with section 1908 of this title.
            ``(2) Contracts with a value less than $750,000.--For

        less than $750,000, the contracting officer shall make a 
        determination whether two-phase selection procedures are 
        appropriate for use for entering into a contract for the design 
        and construction of a public building, facility, or work when--
                    ``(A) the contracting officer anticipates that 3 or 
                more offers will be received for the contract;
                    ``(B) design work must be performed before an

                contract;
                    ``(C) the offeror will incur a substantial amount 
                of expense in preparing the offer; and

                            ``(iv) the suitability of the project for 
                        use of the two-phase selection procedures;
                            ``(v) the capability of the agency to 
                        manage the two-phase selection process; and
                            ``(vi) other criteria established by the 
                        agency.''.

                    (A) In general.--Not later than November 30 of 
                2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, the head of each 
                agency shall compile an annual report of each instance 
                in which the agency awarded a design-build contract 
                pursuant to section 3309 of title 41, United States 
                Code, during the fiscal year ending in such calendar 
                year, in which--
                            (i) more than 5 finalists were selected for 
                        phase-two requests for proposals; or
                            (ii) the contract or order was awarded

the final reports required under subsection (f) of section 3309 of

Comptroller General of the United States shall issue a report analyzing 
the compliance of the various Federal agencies with the requirements of

              A CONTRACT FOR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICES.

enactment of this Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in 
consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy,
