 Mr. Lee (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hoeven, and Mr. Cruz) introduced

                                 A BILL


 
    To establish the Daniel Webster Congressional Clerkship Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Daniel Webster Congressional 
Clerkship Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Each year, many of the most talented law school 
        graduates in the United States begin their legal careers as 
        judicial law clerks.
            (2) The judicial clerkship program has given the judiciary 
        access to a pool of exceptional young lawyers at a relatively 
        low cost.
            (3) These same lawyers then go on to become leaders of 
        their profession, where they serve a critical role in helping 
        to educate the public about the judiciary and the judicial 
        process.
            (4) The White House, the administrative agencies of the 
        executive branch, the Administrative Office of the United 
        States Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the United 
        States Sentencing Commission all operate analogous programs for 
        talented young professionals at the outset of their careers.
            (5) Congress is without a similar program.
            (6) At a time when our Nation faces considerable 
        challenges, Congress and the public would benefit immeasurably 
        from a program, modeled after the judicial clerkship program, 
        that engages the brightest young lawyers in the Nation in the 
        legislative process.
            (7) Accordingly, the Congress herein creates the Daniel 
        Webster Congressional Clerkship Program, named after one of the 
        most admired and distinguished lawyer-legislators ever to serve 
        in Congress, to improve the business of Congress and increase 
        the understanding of its work by the public.
