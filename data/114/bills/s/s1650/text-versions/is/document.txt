1395f) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(2)(C), by striking ``has had a face-
        to-face encounter'' and inserting ``has, subject to subsection 
        (m), had a face-to-face encounter''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(m) Implementation of Requirement for Certification for Home 
Health Services.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall develop a single 
        form or document to be used by a physician to satisfy the 
        documentation requirements necessary to fulfill the requirement 
        of a face-to-face encounter and other criteria for home health 
        eligibility under subsection (a)(2)(C) (otherwise known as the 
        certification for home health services).
            ``(2) Stakeholder input.--In developing the form or 
        document under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall seek input 
        from stakeholders, including physicians and other non-physician 
        providers (such as nurse practitioners or clinical nurse 
        specialists (as those terms are defined in section 
        1861(aa)(5))), home health agencies, hospitals, patients or 
        representatives of patients, and other entities (such as 
        electronic medical record vendors) the Secretary determines 
        appropriate. The Secretary shall provide the opportunity for 
        such stakeholders to offer input on the form or document during 
        its initial development as well as the opportunity to make 
        comments on a proposed version prior to its finalization. The 
        Secretary shall also set up a process to educate physicians and 
        non-physicians on how to appropriately fulfill the requirements 
        related to the form or document in this section prior to 
        implementation.
            ``(3) Content of form.--The Secretary shall accept the 
        following content as documentation of an individual's 
        eligibility for home health services:
                    ``(A) With respect to the face-to-face encounter 
                requirement, the date of the encounter.
                    ``(B) With respect to homebound status, a statement 
                that provides the clinical basis for why the individual 
                is determined to be confined to the home.
                    ``(C) With respect to the need for skilled 
                services, a selection, via checkbox, of the types of 
                skilled services required by the individual and a 
                statement with the clinical basis for each type of 
                skilled service ordered.
            ``(4) Deemed satisfaction of requirements.--The Secretary 
        shall, through guidance, allow the requirement for 
        documentation of a face-to-face encounter and other criteria 
        for home health eligibility under subsection (a)(2)(C) to be 
        deemed satisfied with respect to an individual if a home health 
        agency completes the form or document under paragraph (1) and 
        the ordering physician signs or attests to the contents of the 
        form or document.
            ``(5) Exception to face-to-face encounter requirement.--The 
        Secretary shall waive the requirement for a face-to-face 
        encounter under subsection (a)(2)(C) related to home health 
        services provided to an individual if the individual has been 
        discharged from a hospital (including from the emergency 
        department) or skilled nursing facility within 14 days prior to 
        the initiation of such home health services.
            ``(6) Guidance to contractors.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall provide 
                notification, guidance, and education regarding the 
                application of the form or document under paragraph (1) 
                as it pertains to satisfying the documentation 
                requirements for home health services under subsection 
                (a)(2)(C) to medicare administrative contractors (as 
                defined in section 1874A), recovery audit contractors 
                (as defined in section 1893(h)), and any other entity 
                which the Secretary determines appropriate.
                    ``(B) National applicability.--The Secretary shall 
                ensure that all medicare administrative contractors, 
                recovery audit contractors, and any other entity which

                under this paragraph in a nationally consistent and 
                uniform manner and that all audit activities, policies, 
                and practices regarding documentation for home health 
                services are likewise applied in a nationally 
                consistent and uniform manner.
                    ``(C) Study.--Not later than 18 months after the 
                date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary 
                shall submit to Congress a report on--

                        administrative contractors, recovery audit 
                        contractors, and any other entity which the 
                        Secretary determines appropriate to nationally 
                        consistent and uniform audit activities, 
                        policies, and practices as described in 
                        subparagraph (B); and
                            ``(ii) the rate of appeals for denial of 
                        payment based solely on the face-to-face 
                        encounter requirements for home health services 
                        under this section and the rate of such appeals 
                        that are ultimately successful.''.

Certain Home Health Claims Provisions Under Part A.--The provisions of 
section 1814(m) shall apply with respect to the application of

                settlement agreement with the Secretary of Health and 
                Human Services in lieu of reprocessing claims for

        such claim shall be determined and processed as if the 
        narrative requirements of section 424.22(v) of title 42, Code 
        of Federal Regulations, did not apply at the time such services 
        were furnished.
