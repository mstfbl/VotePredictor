                Corps program or be incompatible with the maintenance 
                of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships 
                between the Job Corps center to which the individual 
                might be assigned and communities surrounding the Job 
                Corps center;

                    (C) the individual has passed a background check 
                conducted in accordance with procedures established by

        supervision of the probation or parole official involved is 
        satisfactory to the official and the Secretary and does not 
        violate applicable laws (including regulations). No individual 
        shall be denied a position in the Job Corps solely on the basis

                    (A) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees 
                at the Job Corps center that reside in the State in 
                which the center is located; and
                    (B) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees 
                at the Job Corps center that reside in the region in

                regions.
            (2) Analysis.--In order to develop the plan described in 
        paragraph (1), every 2 years the Secretary, in consultation 
        with operators of Job Corps centers, shall analyze relevant 
        factors relating to each Job Corps center, including--
                    (A) the size of the population of individuals 
                eligible to participate in Job Corps in the State and 
                region in which the Job Corps center is located, and in 
                surrounding regions;
                    (B) the relative demand for participation in the 
                Job Corps in the State and region, and in surrounding 
                regions;
                    (C) the capacity and utilization of the Job Corps 
                center, including the education, training, and 
                supportive services provided through the center; and
                    (D) the performance of the Job Corps center 
                relating to the expected levels of performance 
                described in section 359(c)(1) for the performance 
                indicators described in section 402(b)(2), and whether 
                any actions have been taken with respect to such center 
                pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 359(f).
    (d) Assignment of Individual Enrollees.--
            (1) In general.--After an individual has been selected for 
        the Job Corps in accordance with the standards and procedures 
        of the Secretary under subsection (a), the enrollee shall be 
        assigned to the Job Corps center that offers the type of career 
        and technical education and training selected by the individual 
        and, among the centers that offer such education and training, 
        is closest to the home of the individual. The Secretary may 
        waive this requirement if--
                    (A) the enrollee would be unduly delayed in 
                participating in the Job Corps program because the 
                closest center is operating at full capacity; or
                    (B) the parent or guardian of the enrollee requests 
                assignment of the enrollee to another Job Corps center 
                due to circumstances in the community of the enrollee 
                that would impair prospects for successful 
                participation in the Job Corps program.
            (2) Enrollees who are younger than 18.--An enrollee who is 
        younger than 18 shall not be assigned to a Job Corps center 
        other than the center closest to the home that offers the 
        career and technical education and training desired by the 
        enrollee pursuant to paragraph (1) if the parent or guardian of 
        the enrollee objects to the assignment.

Corps for more than 2 years, except--
            (1) in a case in which completion of an advanced career 
        training program under section 348(c) would require an 
        individual to participate in the Job Corps for not more than 
        one additional year;
            (2) in the case of an individual with a disability who 
        would reasonably be expected to meet the standards for a Job 
        Corps graduate, as defined under section 342(6), if allowed to 
        participate in the Job Corps for not more than 1 additional 
        year;
            (3) in the case of an individual who participates in 
        national service, as authorized by a Civilian Conservation 
        Center program, who would be granted an enrollment extension in 
        the Job Corps for the amount of time equal to the period of 
        national service; or
            (4) as the Secretary may authorize in a special case.

                                    (I) be expressed in an objective, 
                                quantifiable, and measurable form; and

                                performance.
                            (ii) Identification in state plan.--Each 
                        State shall identify, in the State plan 
                        submitted under section 212, expected levels of 
                        performance for each of the performance 
                        indicators described in subsection (b)(2) for

                        return on the investment of Federal funds in

                        Secretary and each Governor shall reach 
                        agreement on levels of performance for the

                        for all of the fiscal years covered by the 
                        State plan. Such levels of performance shall be

                        program providing worker training services and 
                        activities through the State, State board,

                        disaggregated by the demographic factors 
                        described in subsection (b)(3). The levels 
                        agreed to shall be considered to be the State 
                        adjusted levels of performance for such years 
                        and shall be incorporated into the State plan

                            (iv) Revisions.--If unanticipated 
                        circumstances arise in a State, the Governor 
                        may request that the State adjusted levels of 
                        performance agreed to under clause (iii) be 
                        revised. The Secretary shall issue objective 
                        criteria and methods for making such revisions.
                    (B) Levels of performance for additional 
                indicators.--The State may, if the State chooses--
                            (i) select other performance indicators in 
                        addition to the indicators required under 
                        subsection (b)(2); and
                            (ii) identify in the State plan the State 
                        levels of performance for such additional 
                        performance indicators.
            (2) Sanctions for state failure to meet state performance 
        measures.--
                    (A) Sanctions against states.--If a State fails to 
                meet the State adjusted levels of performance under 
                paragraph (1)(A) for a program for 2 consecutive fiscal 
                years, or if a State fails to submit a complete report 
                under subsection (c) for any fiscal year, the Secretary 
                may reduce by not more than 5 percent the amount of the 
                grant that would (in the absence of this paragraph) be 
                payable to the State under such program for the 
                immediately succeeding fiscal year. Any such penalty 
                for failure to meet the State adjusted levels of 
                performance shall be based on the degree of failure to 
                meet such State adjusted levels of performance.
                    (B) Funds resulting from reduced allotments.--The 
                Secretary shall use any amount retained as a result of 
                a reduction in an allotment to a State made under 
                subparagraph (A) to increase the allotments to all 
                other States under section 312(c)(2) in accordance with 
                such section.
    (e) Levels of Performance and Sanctions for Other Direct 
Recipients.--By not later than 90 days after the effective date of this 
Act, the Secretary shall establish a performance accountability system 
for other direct recipients that--
            (1) for each covered program providing worker training 
        services and activities offered by such other direct recipient, 
        establishes levels of performance for the indicators described 
        in subsection (b)(2) (as applicable to the program), adjusted 
        levels of performance for such indicators, and sanctions for 
        failure to meet those levels; and
            (2) is comparable to the accountability system for States 
        established under subsections (c) and (d).
    (f) Regulations.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to 
carry out subsections (c) through (e), and to establish requirements 
regarding the content, timing, and submission of the report required 
under subsection (c)(1), including requirements regarding what data 
should be provided and how that data should be formatted.

            (2) Monitoring and sanctions for other direct recipients.--
        By not later than 90 days after the effective date of this Act,

        requirements of this Act, the Secretary may offset repayment of 
        such expenditures against any other amount to which the State 
        or recipient is or may be entitled, except as provided under 
        subsection (d)(1).
            (3) Special rules for states.--
                    (A) Repayment from deduction by state.--If the 
                Secretary requires a State to repay funds as a result 
                of a determination that a local area of the State has 
                expended funds contrary to the requirements of this 
                Act, the Governor or State board may use an amount 
                deducted under subparagraph (B) to repay the funds,

                    (B) Deduction by state.--The Governor or State

                    (C) Limitations.--A deduction made by a State as 
                described in subparagraph (C) shall not be made until 
                such time as the Governor or State board has taken 
                appropriate corrective action to ensure full compliance 
                within such local area with regard to appropriate 
                expenditures of funds under this Act.
    (d) Repayment of Amounts.--
            (1) In general.--Each State or other direct recipient shall 
        be liable to repay the amounts described in subsection (c)(1), 
        from funds other than funds received under this Act, upon a 
        determination by the Secretary that the misexpenditure of funds 
        was due to willful disregard of the requirements of this Act, 
        gross negligence, failure to observe accepted standards of 
        administration, or a pattern of misexpenditure as described in 
        subsection (c)(1). No such determination shall be made under 
        this subsection or subsection (c) until notice and opportunity 
        for a fair hearing has been given to the recipient.
            (2) Factors in imposing sanctions.--In determining whether 
        to impose any sanction authorized by this section against a 
        State or other direct recipient for violations by a subgrantee 
        or contractor of such State or recipient under this Act 
        (including a violation of the regulations issued under this 
        Act), the Secretary shall first determine whether such State or 
        recipient has adequately demonstrated that the State or 
        recipient has--
                    (A) established and adhered to an appropriate 
                system for the award and monitoring of grants and 
                contracts with subgrantees and contractors that 
                contains acceptable standards for ensuring 
                accountability;
                    (B) entered into a written grant agreement or 
                contract with such subgrantee or contractor that 
                established clear goals and obligations in unambiguous 
                terms;
                    (C) acted with due diligence to monitor the 
                implementation of the grant agreement or contract, 
                including carrying out the appropriate monitoring 
                activities (including audits) at reasonable intervals; 
                and
                    (D) taken prompt and appropriate corrective action 
                upon becoming aware of any evidence of a violation of 
                this Act, including regulations issued under this Act, 
                by such subgrantee or contractor.
            (3) Waiver.--If the Secretary determines that the State or 
        other direct recipient has demonstrated substantial compliance 
        with the requirements of paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive 
        the imposition of sanctions authorized by this section upon 
        such State or recipient. The Secretary is authorized to impose 
        any sanction consistent with the provisions of this Act and any 
        applicable Federal or State law directly against any subgrantee 
        or contractor for a violation of this Act, including 
        regulations issued under this Act.
    (e) Immediate Termination or Suspension of Assistance in Emergency 
Situations.--In emergency situations, if the Secretary determines it is 
necessary to protect the integrity of funds provided under this Act or 
ensure the proper operation of the worker training service or activity 
involved, the Secretary may immediately terminate or suspend financial 
assistance, in whole or in part, to any recipient of such funds if the 
recipient is given prompt notice and the opportunity for a subsequent 
hearing within 30 days after such termination or suspension. The 
Secretary shall not delegate any of the functions or authority 
specified in this subsection, other than to an officer whose 
appointment is required to be made by and with the advice and consent 
of the Senate.
    (f) Discrimination Against Participants.--If the Secretary 
determines that any recipient under this Act has discharged or in any 
other manner discriminated against a participant or against any 
individual in connection with the administration of the program 
involved, or against any individual because such individual has filed 
any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding 
under or related to this Act, or has testified or is about to testify 
in any such proceeding or investigation under or related to this Act, 
or otherwise unlawfully denied to any individual a benefit to which 
that individual is entitled under the provisions of this Act or the 
Secretary's regulations, the Secretary shall, within 30 days, take such 
action or order such corrective measures, as necessary, with respect to 
the recipient or the aggrieved individual, or both.
    (g) Remedies.--The remedies described in this section shall not be 
construed to be the exclusive remedies available for violations 
described in this section.

                    (A) In general.--In carrying out any audit under 
                this Act (other than any initial audit survey or any
