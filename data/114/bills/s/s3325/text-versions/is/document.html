SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States--
            (1) to support peaceful, democratic, and inclusive 
        development of Burma; and
            (2) to support United States and international assistance, 
        as appropriate, to address urgent and long-term development and 
        infrastructure challenges in Burma, including universal access 
        to electricity.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since 2011, the Government of Burma has taken admirable 
        and concrete steps toward the establishment of democratic 
        institutions and the rule of law.
            (2) The November 2015 parliamentary elections in Burma were 
        conducted in a peaceful and transparent manner and culminated 
        in an overwhelming victory for the National League of Democracy 
        (NLD), led by Nobel Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
            (3) Since assuming office on March 30, 2016, Burma's new 
        President Htin Kyaw has authorized the release of more than 200 
        political prisoners.
            (4) Aung Sun Suu Kyi has successfully initiated a 
        nationwide and historic effort to achieve lasting peace in 
        Burma, titled the ``21st Century Panglong Conference''.
            (5) Burma faces serious short- and long-term economic and 
        development challenges, which the new NLD-led government has 
        pledged to address.
            (6) According to World Bank estimates, over 70 percent of 
        Burma's population and 84 percent of rural households lack 
        access to grid electricity.
            (7) The Government of Burma has announced a National 
        Electrification Plan (NEP) to assure universal access to 
        electricity by 2030.
            (8) The World Bank has approved a $400,000,000 interest-
        free credit to Burma to support the NEP.
            (9) The World Bank has approved $1,690,000,000 total in 
        development projects in Burma.
            (10) The Asian Development Bank has approved $1,920,000,000 
        in development projects in Burma.

        is not otherwise undermining peace and stability in Burma; and
            (2) the President or his designees should closely consult 
        with Congress with respect to, and seek congressional approval 
        for, any modifications to the SDN list or other United States 
        restrictions on assistance to Burma, including any military-to-
