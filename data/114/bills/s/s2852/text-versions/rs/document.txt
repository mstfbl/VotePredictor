<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS; AGENCY DEFINED.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Federal Government data is a valuable national 
        resource. Managing Federal Government data to make it open, 
        available, discoverable, and useable to the general public, 
        businesses, journalists, academics, and advocates promotes 
        efficiency and effectiveness in Government, creates economic 
        opportunities, promotes scientific discovery, and most 
        importantly, strengthens our democracy.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Maximizing the usefulness of Federal 
        Government data that is appropriate for release rests upon 
        making it readily available, discoverable, and usable--in a 
        word: open. Information presumptively should be available to 
        the general public unless the Federal Government reasonably 
        foresees that disclosure could harm a specific, articulable 
        interest protected by law or the Federal Government is 
        otherwise expressly prohibited from releasing such data due to 
        statutory requirements.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) The Federal Government has the responsibility 
        to be transparent and accountable to its citizens.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Data controlled, collected, or created by the 
        Federal Government should be originated, transmitted, and 
        published in modern, open, and electronic format, to be as 
        readily accessible as possible, consistent with data standards 
        imbued with authority under this Act and to the extent 
        permitted by law.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) The effort to inventory Government data will 
        have additional benefits, including identifying opportunities 
        within agencies to reduce waste, increase efficiencies, and 
        save taxpayer dollars. As such, this effort should involve many 
        types of data, including data generated by applications, 
        devices, networks, and equipment, which can be harnessed to 
        improve operations, lower energy consumption, reduce costs, and 
        strengthen security.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) Communication, commerce, and data transcend 
        national borders. Global access to Government information is 
        often essential to promoting innovation, scientific discovery, 
        entrepreneurship, education, and the general welfare.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Agency Defined.--In this Act, the term ``agency'' has 
the meaning given that term in section 3502 of title 44, United States 
Code, and includes the Federal Election Commission.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.</DELETED>

shall be construed to require the disclosure of information or records 
that are exempt from public disclosure under section 552 of title 5, 
United States Code.</DELETED>

Government Data Act''.

follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings; agency defined.
Sec. 3. Rule of construction.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; AGENCY DEFINED.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Federal Government data is a valuable national 
        resource. Managing Federal Government data to make it open, 
        available, discoverable, and useable to the general public, 
        businesses, journalists, academics, and advocates promotes 
        efficiency and effectiveness in Government, creates economic 
        opportunities, promotes scientific discovery, and most 
        importantly, strengthens our democracy.
            (2) Maximizing the usefulness of Federal Government data 
        that is appropriate for release rests upon making it readily 
        available, discoverable, and usable--in a word: open. 
        Information presumptively should be available to the general 
        public unless the Federal Government reasonably foresees that 
        disclosure could harm a specific, articulable interest 
        protected by law or the Federal Government is otherwise 
        expressly prohibited from releasing such data due to statutory 
        requirements.
            (3) The Federal Government has the responsibility to be 
        transparent and accountable to its citizens.
            (4) Data controlled, collected, or created by the Federal 
        Government should be originated, transmitted, and published in 
        modern, open, and electronic format, to be as readily 
        accessible as possible, consistent with data standards imbued 
        with authority under this Act and to the extent permitted by 
        law.
            (5) The effort to inventory Government data will have 
        additional benefits, including identifying opportunities within 
        agencies to reduce waste, increase efficiencies, and save 
        taxpayer dollars. As such, this effort should involve many 
        types of data, including data generated by applications, 
        devices, networks, and equipment, which can be harnessed to 
        improve operations, lower energy consumption, reduce costs, and 
        strengthen security.
            (6) Communication, commerce, and data transcend national 
        borders. Global access to Government information is often 
        essential to promoting innovation, scientific discovery, 
        entrepreneurship, education, and the general welfare.
    (b) Agency Defined.--In this Act, the term ``agency'' has the 
meaning given that term in section 3502 of title 44, United States 
Code, and includes the Federal Election Commission.

SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

construed to require the disclosure of information or records that are 
exempt from public disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United
