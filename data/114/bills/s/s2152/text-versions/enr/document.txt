    To establish a comprehensive United States Government policy to 
 encourage the efforts of countries in sub-Saharan Africa to develop an 
appropriate mix of power solutions, including renewable energy, for more 
   broadly distributed electricity access in order to support poverty 
reduction, promote development outcomes, and drive economic growth, and 
                           for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Electrify Africa Act of 2015''.
SEC. 2. PURPOSE.
    The purpose of this Act is to encourage the efforts of countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa to improve access to affordable and reliable 
electricity in Africa in order to unlock the potential for inclusive 
economic growth, job creation, food security, improved health, 
education, and environmental outcomes, and poverty reduction.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
    It is the policy of the United States to partner, consult, and 
coordinate with the governments of sub-Saharan African countries, 
international financial institutions, and African regional economic 
communities, cooperatives, and the private sector, in a concerted 
effort to--
        (1) promote first-time access to power and power services for 
    at least 50,000,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 in both 
    urban and rural areas;
        (2) encourage the installation of at least 20,000 additional 
    megawatts of electrical power in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 using a 
    broad mix of energy options to help reduce poverty, promote 
    sustainable development, and drive inclusive economic growth;
        (3) promote non-discriminatory reliable, affordable, and 
    sustainable power in urban areas (including small urban areas) to 
    promote economic growth and job creation;
        (4) promote policies to facilitate public-private partnerships 
    to provide non-discriminatory reliable, sustainable, and affordable 
    electrical service to rural and underserved populations;
        (5) encourage the necessary in-country reforms, including 
    facilitating public-private partnerships specifically to support 
    electricity access projects to make such expansion of power access 
    possible;
        (6) promote reforms of power production, delivery, and pricing, 
    as well as regulatory reforms and transparency, to support long-
    term, market-based power generation and distribution;
        (7) promote policies to displace kerosene lighting with other 
    technologies;
        (8) promote an all-of-the-above energy development strategy for 
    sub-Saharan Africa that includes the use of oil, natural gas, coal, 
    hydroelectric, wind, solar, and geothermal power, and other sources 
    of energy; and
        (9) promote and increase the use of private financing and seek 
    ways to remove barriers to private financing and assistance for 
    projects, including through charitable organizations.
