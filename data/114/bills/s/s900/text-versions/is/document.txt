at the end the following:
    ``(k) Limitation on Sale or Lease of Used Passenger Motor 
Vehicles.--(1) A dealer may not sell or lease a used passenger motor 
vehicle until any defect or noncompliance determined under section 
30118 with respect to the vehicle has been remedied.
    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply if--
            ``(A) the recall information regarding a used passenger 
        motor vehicle was not accessible at the time of sale or lease 
        using the means established by the Secretary under section 
        31301 of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act 
        (49 U.S.C. 30166 note); or
            ``(B) notification of the defect or noncompliance is 
        required under section 30118(b), but enforcement of the order 
        is set aside in a civil action to which 30121(d) applies.
    ``(3) Notwithstanding section 30102(a)(1), in this subsection--
            ``(A) the term `dealer' means a person that has sold at 
        least 10 motor vehicles to 1 or more consumers during the most 
        recent 12-month period; and
            ``(B) the term `used passenger motor vehicle' means a motor 
        vehicle that has previously been purchased other than for 
        resale.
    ``(4) By rule, the Secretary may exempt the auctioning of a used 
passenger motor vehicle from the requirements under paragraph (1) to 
the extent that the exemption does not harm public safety.''.
