SEC. 3. GAO REPORT.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study on the effectiveness of awarding priority review 
vouchers under section 529 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 360ff) in providing incentives for the development of drugs 
that treat or prevent rare pediatric diseases (as defined in subsection 
(a)(3) of such section) that would not otherwise have been developed. 
In conducting such study, the Comptroller General shall examine the 
following:
            (1) The indications for which each drug for which a 
        priority review voucher was awarded under such section 529 was 
        approved under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)) or section 351(a) of the 
        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).
            (2) Whether the priority review voucher impacted sponsors' 
        decisions to invest in developing a drug to treat or prevent a 
        rare pediatric disease.
            (3) An analysis of the drugs for which such priority review 
        vouchers were used, which shall include--
                    (A) the indications for which such drugs were 
                approved under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, 
                Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)) or section 
                351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
                262(a));
                    (B) whether unmet medical needs were addressed 
                through the approval of such drugs, including, for each 
                such drug--
                            (i) if an alternative therapy was 
                        previously available to treat the indication; 
                        and
                            (ii) if the drug provided a benefit or 
                        advantage over another available therapy;
                    (C) the number of patients potentially treated by 
                such drugs;
                    (D) the value of the priority review voucher if 
                transferred; and
                    (E) the length of time between the date on which a 
                priority review voucher was awarded and the date on 
                which it was used.
            (4) With respect to the priority review voucher program 
        under section 529 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
        (21 U.S.C. 360ff)--
                    (A) the resources used by the Food and Drug 
                Administration in implementing such program, including 
                the effect of such program on the Food and Drug 
                Administration's review of drugs for which a priority 
                review voucher was not awarded or used;
                    (B) the impact of the program on the public health 
                as a result of the review and approval of drugs that 
                received a priority review voucher and products that 
                were the subject of a redeemed priority review voucher; 
                and
                    (C) alternative approaches to improving such 
                program so that the program is appropriately targeted 
                toward providing incentives for the development of 
                clinically important drugs that--
                            (i) prevent or treat rare pediatric 
                        diseases; and
                            (ii) would likely not otherwise have been 
                        developed to prevent or treat such diseases.
    (b) Report.--Not later than January 31, 2022, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall submit to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report containing 
the results of the study of conducted under subsection (a).
