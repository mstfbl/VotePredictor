To provide for the immediate reinstatement of sanctions against Iran if 
 Iran attempts to acquire nuclear weapons technology from North Korea.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``North Korea and Iran Sanctions 
Act''.

SEC. 2. REINSTATEMENT OF SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the Preface of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
        Action, agreed to at Vienna, July 14, 2015, ``Iran reaffirms 
        that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or 
        acquire any nuclear weapons.''.
            (2) Any attempt by Iran to design, pursue, build or 
        otherwise seek a nuclear weapon would be--
                    (A) an explicit and detectable violation of the 
                Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, agreed 
                to at Washington, London, and Moscow, July 1, 1968; and
                    (B) a violation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
                Action.
    (b) Sanctions.--If the Director of National Intelligence certifies 
that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has acquired, or is 
attempting to acquire, nuclear weapons technology from the Government 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (commonly known as ``North 
Korea'') after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President 
shall immediately reinstate all sanctions against Iran that were waived 
or suspended by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, agreed to at 
Vienna July 14, 2015.
                                 <all>
