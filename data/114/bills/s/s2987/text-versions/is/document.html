SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND SECURITY AT CATEGORY 
              X AIRPORTS.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration shall establish a pilot program at 3 airports to 
reconfigure and install security systems that increase efficiency and 
reduce vulnerabilities in airport terminals, particularly at airports 
that have large open areas where screening is conducted.
    (b) Selection of Airports.--In selecting airports for the pilot 
program established under subsection (a), the Administrator shall--
            (1) select airports from among airports classified by the 
        Transportation Security Administration as category X airports 
        and that are able to begin the reconfiguration and installation 
        of security systems expeditiously; and
            (2) give priority to an airport that--
                    (A) submits a proposal that seeks Federal funding 
                for reconfiguration of the airport's security systems;
                    (B) has the space needed to reduce vulnerabilities 
                and reconfigure the existing security systems; and
                    (C) is able to enter into a cost-sharing 
                arrangement with the Transportation Security 
                Administration under which the airport will provided 
                funding equal to 25 percent of the cost of the pilot 
                program.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF PROTOTYPES FOR 
              AIRPORT SECURITY SYSTEMS.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration shall establish a pilot program at 3 airports to develop 
and test prototypes of screening security systems and security 
checkpoint configurations to expedite the movement of passengers by 
deploying a range of technologies including passive and active systems, 
new types of security baggage and personal screening systems, and new 
systems to review and address passenger and baggage anomalies.
    (b) Selection of Airports.--In selecting airports for the pilot 
program established under subsection (a), the Administrator shall--
            (1) select airports from among airports classified by the 
        Transportation Security Administration as category X airports 
        that are able to begin the reconfiguration and installation of 
        security systems expeditiously;
            (2) consider the space available at airports and the 
        ability of airports to test prototypes; and
            (3) give priority to an airport that--
                    (A) submits a proposal that seeks Federal funding 
                to test prototypes for new airport security systems;
                    (B) has the space needed to reduce vulnerabilities 
                and reconfigure the existing security systems; and
                    (C) is able to enter into a cost-sharing 
                arrangement with the Transportation Security 
                Administration under which the airport will provided 
                funding equal to 25 percent of the cost of the pilot 
                program.

SEC. 4. REPORT REQUIRED.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security 
of the House of Representatives a report on the pilot programs 
established under sections 2 and 3.

SEC. 5. FUNDING.

    The Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration 
shall carry out the pilot programs established under sections 2 and 3 
using amounts--
            (1) appropriated to the Transportation Security 
        Administration before the date of the enactment of this Act and 
        available for obligation as of such date of enactment; and
            (2) amounts obtained as reimbursements from airports under 
        those pilot programs.

SEC. 6. ACCEPTANCE AND PROVISION OF RESOURCES BY THE TRANSPORTATION 
              SECURITY ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 114(m) of title 49, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Acceptance and provision of resources.--In carrying 
        out the functions of the Administration, the Under Secretary
