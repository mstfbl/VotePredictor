                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a 
 constituent-driven program to provide a digital information platform 
 capable of efficiently integrating coastal data with decision-support 
   tools, training, and best practices and to support collection of 
 priority coastal geospatial data to inform and improve local, State, 
regional, and Federal capacities to manage the coastal region, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Coast Act of 
2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for 
        effective Federal partnerships with State and local government, 
        nongovernmental organizations, and the private 
        sector.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and 
        standards-based geospatial information, tools, and training to 
        characterize the United States coastal region is critical for 
        public safety and for the environment, infrastructure, and 
        economy of the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) More than half of all people of the United 
        States (153,000,000) currently live on or near a coast and an 
        additional 12,000,000 are expected in the next 
        decade.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Coastal counties in the United States average 
        300 persons per square mile, compared with the national average 
        of 98.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for 
        construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal 
        counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and 
        institutional construction to support this 
        population.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Over half of the economic productivity of the 
        United States is located within coastal regions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote 
        sensing and other geospatial data play an increasingly 
        important role in decisionmaking and management of the coastal 
        zone and economy, including for--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) flood and coastal storm surge 
                prediction;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) hazard risk and vulnerability 
                assessment;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) emergency response and recovery 
                planning;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) community resilience to longer range 
                coastal change;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) local planning and 
                permitting;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) habitat and ecosystem health 
                assessments; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) landscape change detection.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

To require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a
