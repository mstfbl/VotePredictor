To require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a 
 constituent-driven program to provide a digital information platform 
 capable of efficiently integrating coastal data with decision-support 
   tools, training, and best practices and to support collection of 
 priority coastal geospatial data to inform and improve local, State, 
regional, and Federal capacities to manage the coastal region, and for 
                            other purposes.
