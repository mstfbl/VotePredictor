_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
To require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator 
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to establish a 
 constituent-driven program to provide a digital information platform 
 capable of efficiently integrating coastal data with decision-support 
   tools, training, and best practices and to support collection of 
 priority coastal geospatial data to inform and improve local, State, 
regional, and Federal capacities to manage the coastal region, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Coast Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for effective 
        Federal partnerships with State and local government, 
        nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.
            (2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and standards-
        based geospatial information, tools, and training to 
        characterize the United States coastal region is critical for 
        public safety and for the environment, infrastructure, and 
        economy of the United States.
            (3) More than half of all people of the United States 
        (153,000,000) currently live on or near a coast and an 
        additional 12,000,000 are expected in the next decade.
            (4) Coastal counties in the United States average 300 
        persons per square mile, compared with the national average of 
        98.
            (5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits for 
        construction of single-family homes are issued in coastal 
        counties, combined with other commercial, retail, and 
        institutional construction to support this population.
            (6) Over half of the economic productivity of the United 
        States is located within coastal regions.
            (7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote sensing and 
        other geospatial data play an increasingly important role in 
        decision making and management of the coastal zone and economy, 
        including for--
                    (A) flood and coastal storm surge prediction;
                    (B) hazard risk and vulnerability assessment;
                    (C) emergency response and recovery planning;
                    (D) community resilience to longer range coastal 
                change;
                    (E) local planning and permitting;
                    (F) habitat and ecosystem health assessments; and
                    (G) landscape change detection.
