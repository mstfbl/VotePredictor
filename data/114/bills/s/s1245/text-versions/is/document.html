SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a lack of reliable data and information on the 
        amount and types of weapons and equipment that law enforcement 
        agencies purchase using Federal funding, and the use and 
        deployment of those weapons and equipment.
            (2) The Federal Government lacks reliable data and 
        information about the number, composition, and deployment of 
        Special Weapons and Tactics teams (referred to in this section 
        as ``SWAT teams'').
            (3) According to estimates, the percentage of small towns 
        in the United States that had SWAT teams grew from 20 percent 
        in the 1980s to 80 percent in the mid-2000s.
            (4) According to estimates, the number of SWAT team raids 
        per year grew from 3,000 in the 1980s to 45,000 in the mid-
        2000s.
            (5) The majority of SWAT team deployments are for the 
        purpose of executing a warrant.
            (6) In 2014, the Federal Government provided more than 
        $2,000,000,000 in grants and equipment to law enforcement 
        agencies.
            (7) In 2013 and 2014, the Department of Defense provided 
        excess Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (referred to in 
        this section as ``MRAPs'') to 624 local law enforcement 
        agencies for free.
            (8) MRAPs can weigh up to 17 tons and cost up to $600,000, 
        and are known to damage road surfaces due to their weight.
            (9) State and local governments that are responsible for 
        oversight of their law enforcement agencies are not always 
        aware of equipment and grant funding that the law enforcement 
        agencies obtain from the Federal Government.
