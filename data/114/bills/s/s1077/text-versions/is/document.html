    To provide for expedited development of and priority review for 
                         breakthrough devices.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Breakthrough Devices for 
Patients Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. EXPEDITED DEVELOPMENT OF AND PRIORITY REVIEW FOR BREAKTHROUGH 
              DEVICES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 515A 
the following:

``SEC. 515B. EXPEDITED DEVELOPMENT OF AND PRIORITY REVIEW FOR 
              BREAKTHROUGH DEVICES.

    ``(a) In General.--In order to provide for more effective treatment 
or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human 
disease or conditions, the Secretary shall establish a program to 
expedite the development of and provide for the priority review for 
devices--
            ``(1) representing breakthrough technologies;
            ``(2) for which no approved alternatives exist;
            ``(3) offering significant advantages over existing 
        approved or cleared alternatives, including the potential, 
        compared to existing approved alternatives, to reduce or 
        eliminate the need for hospitalization, improve patient quality 
        of life, facilitate patients' ability to manage their own care 
        (such as through self-directed personal assistance), or 
        establish long-term clinical efficiencies; or
            ``(4) the availability of which is in the best interest of 
        patients.
    ``(b) Request for Designation.--A sponsor of a device may request 
that the Secretary designate the device for expedited development and 
priority review under this section. Any such request for designation 
may be made at any time prior to the submission of an application under 
section 515(c), a petition for classification under section 513(f)(2), 
or a notification under section 510(k).
    ``(c) Designation Process.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 60 calendar days after 
        the receipt of a request under subsection (b), the Secretary 
        shall determine whether the device that is the subject of the 
        request meets the criteria described in subsection (a). If the 
        Secretary determines that the device meets the criteria, the 
        Secretary shall designate the device for expedited development 
        and priority review.
            ``(2) Review.--Review of a request under subsection (b) 
        shall be undertaken by a team that is composed of experienced 
        staff and managers of the Food and Drug Administration and is 
        chaired by a senior manager.
            ``(3) Withdrawal.--The Secretary may not withdraw a 
        designation granted under this section on the basis of the 
        criteria under subsection (a) no longer applying because of the 
        subsequent clearance or approval of another device that--
                    ``(A) was designated under this section; or
                    ``(B) was given priority review under section 
                515(d)(5), as in effect prior to the date of enactment 
                of the Advancing Breakthrough Devices for Patients Act 
                of 2015.
    ``(d) Expedited Development and Priority Review.--
            ``(1) Actions.--For purposes of expediting the development 
        and review of devices designated under subsection (c) the

                leader with appropriate subject matter expertise and 
                experience, for each device for which a request is 
                submitted under subsection (b);
                    ``(B) provide for oversight of the team by senior 
                agency personnel to facilitate the efficient 
                development of the device and the efficient review of 
                any submission described in subsection (b) for the 
                device;
                    ``(C) adopt an efficient process for timely dispute 
                resolution;

                shorter or smaller clinical trials, application of 
                surrogate endpoints, and the use of adaptive trial 
                designs and Bayesian statistics, to the extent

                        essential to determining the safety or 
                        effectiveness of such device exists, provided
