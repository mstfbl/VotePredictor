&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) In General.--In order to provide for more effective 
treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating 
human disease or conditions, the Secretary shall establish a program to 
expedite the development of and provide for the priority review for 
devices--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(3) offering significant advantages over 
        existing approved or cleared alternatives, including the 
        potential, compared to existing approved alternatives, to 
        reduce or eliminate the need for hospitalization, improve 
        patient quality of life, facilitate patients' ability to manage 
        their own care (such as through self-directed personal 
        assistance), or establish long-term clinical efficiencies;

        subject of the request meets the criteria described in 
        subsection (a). If the Secretary determines that the device 
        meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the device 
        for expedited development and priority review.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
