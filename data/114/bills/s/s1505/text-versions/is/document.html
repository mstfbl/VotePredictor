                                 A BILL


 
 To amend part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
     Act of 1965 to provide grants for the repair, renovation, and 
           construction of elementary and secondary schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``School Building Fairness Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Providing safe, healthy, and modern public elementary 
        school and secondary school facilities is a crucial component 
        of improving student academic performance and retaining 
        effective, high-quality educators.
            (2) The Department of Education reports that a growing body 
        of research has linked student achievement and behavior to the 
        physical condition of school buildings.
            (3) The 2013 Infrastructure Report Card compiled by the 
        American Society of Civil Engineers gives the Nation's public 
        schools a D grade.
            (4) In 2014, the National Center for Education Statistics 
        reported that a majority (53 percent) of the Nation's 
        elementary schools and secondary schools are in need of 
        renovations, modernization, or repairs to be brought into 
        ``good condition''. The estimated cost for this work is 
        $197,000,000,000, or an average of $4,500,000 per school.
            (5) From 2000-2008, approximately $20,000,000,000 was spent 
        annually on school construction; since the start of the Great 
        Recession in 2008, that spending has declined by half, to 
        approximately $10,000,000,000 per year by 2012.
            (6) In 1998, the Department of Education reported that the 
        average age of a public elementary school or secondary school 
        building was estimated to be 42 years old.
            (7) Due to the absence of national data on school 
        facilities for more than a decade, a complete picture of the 
        condition of the Nation's schools remains mostly unknown.
            (8) According to the 2006 report ``Greening America's 
        Schools: Costs and Benefits'', green schools use 33 percent 
        less energy and 32 percent less water than conventionally built 
        schools, generating financial savings of about $70 per square 
        foot.
            (9) On average, green schools save $100,000 per year on 
        operating costs.
