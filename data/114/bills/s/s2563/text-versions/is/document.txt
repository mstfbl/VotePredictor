                                 A BILL


 
To affirm the importance of the land forces of the United States Armed 
 Forces and to authorize fiscal year 2016 end-strength minimum levels 
  for the active and reserve components of such land forces, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Security Through 
Utilizing Right-Sized End-Strengths Act of 2016'' or the ``POSTURE Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Given the volatile, uncertain, and ambiguous world and the need for 
trained and ready Land Forces of the United States, in conjunction with 
joint and multinational forces, to deter threats, shape the 
international security environment, respond to emergent situations and 
crises, and, if necessary, to fight and win the Nation's wars, it is 
the sense of Congress that the planned drawdown of Land Forces should 
immediately cease.
