                                 A BILL


 
    To reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and Control in the 
        Environmental Protection Agency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Quiet Communities Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that:
            (1) Approximately 28,000,000 people of the United States 
        are afflicted with hearing loss, and it has been estimated that 
        10,000,000 of these hearing impairments are at least partially 
        attributable to damage from exposure to noise.
            (2) For millions of people of the United States, noise from 
        aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other sources is 
        a constant source of torment. Millions of people of the United 
        States are exposed to noise levels that can lead to sleep loss, 
        psychological and physiological damage, and work disruption.
            (3) Chronic exposure to noise has been linked to an 
        increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, learning deficits 
        in children, stress, and a diminished quality of life.
            (4) Sleep deprivation and task interruptions caused by 
        excessive noise can result in untold costs to society through 
        diminished worker productivity.
            (5) Under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the 
        Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 et seq.), and the 
        Quiet Communities Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-609; 92 Stat. 
        3079), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
        established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control. Before 
        the termination of the Office, the duties of the Office 
        included--
                    (A) the promulgation of noise emission standards;
                    (B) the enforcement of relevant product labeling 
                requirements;
                    (C) the facilitation of the development of low 
                emission products;
                    (D) the coordination of Federal noise reduction 
                programs;
                    (E) the provision of assistance to State and local 
                abatement efforts; and
                    (F) the promotion of noise education and research.
            (6) Funding for the Office was terminated in 1982 and no 
        funds have been provided since that year.
            (7) Noise abatement programs throughout the United States 
        lie dormant because--
                    (A) funding for the enforcement of regulations 
                promulgated under the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 
                U.S.C. 4901 et seq.) was terminated, although the 
                Administrator remains legally responsible for the 
                enforcement of the regulations; and
                    (B) the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 
                et seq.) prohibits State and local governments from 
                regulating noise sources in many situations.
            (8) As population growth and air and vehicular traffic 
        continue to increase, noise pollution is likely to become an 
        even greater problem in the future. The health and welfare of 
        the people of the United States demands that the Administrator, 
        as the head of the lead Federal agency for the protection of 
        public health and welfare, once again assume a role in 
        combating noise pollution.
