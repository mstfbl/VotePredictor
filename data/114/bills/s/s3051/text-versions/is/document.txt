                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
 program to provide service dogs to certain veterans with severe post-
                       traumatic stress disorder.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Puppies Assisting Wounded 
Servicemembers (PAWS) Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An estimated 14 percent of members of the Armed Forces 
        returning from active duty service in support of Operation 
        Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom suffer from post-
        traumatic stress disorder.
            (2) The resulting hyperstimulation of the fight-flight-
        freeze response associated with post-traumatic stress disorder 
        poses a threat to the successful societal reintegration of such 
        members of the Armed Forces.
            (3) Animals such as dogs can buffer this stress response 
        when humans fail to provide social support.
            (4) Interaction with dogs has been shown to modulate 
        symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as anxiety, 
        including fear response and hyperarousal, interpersonal 
        difficulties, social isolation, physical pain, and sleep 
        disturbances.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM ON PROVISION BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OF 
              SERVICE DOGS TO CERTAIN VETERANS WITH SEVERE POST-
              TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

    (a) Pilot Program.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting 
        through the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural

        service dogs to eligible veterans.
            (2) Veterinary insurance.--The Secretary shall furnish

    (b) Eligibility.--
            (1) Initial eligibility.--A veteran is eligible for a

                disorder rated at a severity level of three or four on 
                the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-
                5);
                    (B) has completed an established evidence-based 
                treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and 
                remains significantly symptomatic, as evidenced by the 
                Global Assessment of Functioning or a similar clinical 
                metric;
                    (C) has served on active duty in the Armed Forces

                treated with established evidence-based therapies.
            (2) Ongoing eligibility for veterinary insurance.--To 
        remain eligible to receive veterinary health insurance from the 
        Department for a service dog provided under the pilot program, 
        a veteran shall see a physician at a medical facility of the 
        Department who is a primary care provider or mental health care 
        provider not less frequently than once every 90 days.
    (c) Contract Authority.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program, the 
        Secretary shall enter into such contracts as may be necessary

        International or a similar organization and that--
                    (A) on average, provide one-on-one training for 
                each service dog for a minimum of 30 hours during a

                with their new service dog;
                    (C) ensure all service dogs trained by the provider 
                pass the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen test 
                prior to permanent placement with a recipient; and
                    (D) provide follow-up support service for the life
