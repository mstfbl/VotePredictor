    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall provide to 
each State which meets the requirements of subsection (d) a cost 
mitigation grant for each calendar year after 2015 in an amount 
determined under subsection (c).
    (b) Use of Funds.--A State receiving a cost mitigation grant under 
this section may use the grant only--
            (1) to assist low-income households in reducing energy 
        expenses and meeting cost increases attributable to the fees 
        imposed under subchapter E of chapter 38 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by this Act);
            (2) to assist rural households in reducing energy expenses 
        and meeting such increases attributable to such fees; and
            (3) to provide job training and worker transition 
        assistance, with priority given to workers and former workers 
        in fossil-fuel related industries.
    (c) Amount of Grant.--
            (1) In general.--The amount of the cost mitigation grant 
        made to any State for any calendar year shall be equal to the 
        product of--
                    (A) the annual grant limitation determined under 
                paragraph (3) for such calendar year; and
                    (B) the State allocation percentage for the State 
                (determined under paragraph (2)).
            (2) State allocation percentage.--The ``State allocation 
        percentage'' for a State is the amount (expressed as a 
        percentage) equal to the quotient of--
                    (A) the population of such State (as reported in 
                the most recent decennial census); and
                    (B) the population of all States (as reported in 
                the most recent decennial census).
            (3) Annual grant limitation.--
                    (A) In general.--The annual grant limitation is 
                $20,000,000,000.
                    (B) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any 
                calendar year after 2016, the $20,000,000,000 amount in 
                subparagraph (A) shall be increased by an amount equal 
                to--
                            (i) such dollar amount; multiplied by
                            (ii) the cost-of-living adjustment 
                        determined under section 1(f)(3) of the 
                        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the calendar 
                        year, determined by substituting ``calendar 
                        year 2015'' for ``calendar year 1992'' in 
                        subparagraph (B) thereof.
            (4) Redistribution.--In any case in which one or more 
        States do not meet the requirements described in subsection (d) 
        for a calendar year, an amount equal to the State allocation 
        percentage for such State or States shall be distributed to 
        each State which did meet such conditions in an amount equal to 
        the product of--
                    (A) such amount; and
                    (B) the State allocation percentage of such State 
                (determined by not taking into account under paragraph 
                (2)(B) the population of any State which did not meet 
                the requirements of subsection (d) for such calendar 
                year).
