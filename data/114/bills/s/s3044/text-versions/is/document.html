SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in 2015, a Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of 
        Puerto Rico's Public Debt was established in Puerto Rico under 
        Act 97; and
            (2) the Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of Puerto 
        Rico's Public Debt is currently conducting an audit of the debt 
        held by Puerto Rico.

SEC. 102. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to ensure that pensions of ordinary investors are 
        protected; and

        the 3,500,000 people in Puerto Rico.

SEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) if the Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of Puerto 
        Rico's Public Debt finds that any of the debt held by Puerto 
        Rico was acquired in violation of the Constitution of Puerto 
        Rico, the Puerto Rican government should immediately set aside 
        this debt and suggest to holders of this debt that they seek 
        redress from the investment banks that helped market and sell 
        these unconstitutional instruments;
            (2) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
        has the authority to provide emergency financing to Puerto Rico 
        to facilitate an orderly restructuring of the debt held by 
        Puerto Rico under sections 13(3) and 14(2)(b) of the Federal 
        Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 343 and 355); and
            (3) Puerto Rico is experiencing a humanitarian crisis, and 
        that the American government must meet the basic human needs of 
        its citizens ahead of the profits of Wall Street.

        hearing, the Board may grant relief from a stay under paragraph 
        (1)--
                    (A) for cause, including the lack of adequate 
                protection of a security interest in property of such 
                party in interest; or
                    (B) with respect to a stay of an act against 
                property under paragraph (1), if--
                            (i) the applying entity does not have an 
                        equity in such property; and
                            (ii) such property is not necessary for the 
                        Commonwealth or municipality to provide 
                        essential services.
            (3) Thirty days after a request under paragraph (4) for 
        relief from the stay of any act against property of the 
        Commonwealth or a municipality under paragraph (1), such stay 
        is terminated with respect to the party in interest making such 
        request, unless the Board, after notice and a hearing, orders 
        such stay continued in effect pending the conclusion of, or as 
        a result of, a final hearing and determination under paragraph 
        (4). A hearing under this subsection may be a preliminary 
        hearing, or may be consolidated with the final hearing under 
        paragraph (4). The Corporation shall order such stay continued 
        in effect pending the conclusion of the final hearing under 
        paragraph (4) if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
        party opposing relief from such stay will prevail at the 
        conclusion of such final hearing. If the hearing under this 
        subsection is a preliminary hearing, then such final hearing 
        shall be concluded not later than 30 days after the conclusion 
        of such preliminary hearing, unless the 30-day period is 
        extended with the consent of the parties in interest or for a 
        specific time which the Corporation finds is required by 
        compelling circumstances.
            (4) Upon request of a party in interest, the Corporation, 
        with or without a hearing, shall grant such relief from the 
        stay provided under paragraph (1) as is necessary to prevent 
        irreparable damage to the secured interest of an entity in 
        property, if such interest will suffer such damage before there 
        is an opportunity for notice and a hearing under paragraph (2) 
        or (3).
            (5) No order, judgment, or decree entered in violation of 
        this section shall have any force or effect.
            (6) In any hearing under paragraph (2) or (3) concerning 
        relief from a stay--
                    (A) the party requesting such relief has the burden 
                of proof on the issue of the applying entity's equity 
                in property; and
                    (B) the party opposing such relief has the burden 
                of proof on all other issues.
