                    ``(A) that expressly advocates the election or 
                defeat of a clearly identified candidate, or is the 
                functional equivalent of express advocacy because, when 
                taken as a whole, it can be interpreted by a reasonable 
                person only as advocating the election or defeat of a 
                candidate, taking into account whether the 
                communication involved mentions a candidacy, a 
                political party, or a challenger to a candidate, or 
                takes a position on a candidate's character,

        the Federal district court for the district in which the 
        respondent resides or has its principal place of business, or 
        for the District of Columbia. Such court shall have
