1395m) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(s) Payment for Applicable Disposable Devices.--
            ``(1) Separate payment.--The Secretary shall make a payment 
        (separate from the payments otherwise made under section 1895)

        payment is made under section 1895(b).
            ``(2) Applicable disposable device.--In this subsection, 
        the term `applicable disposable device' means a disposable 
        device that, as determined by the Secretary, is--
                    ``(A) a disposable negative pressure wound therapy 
                device that is an integrated system comprised of a non-
                manual vacuum pump, a receptacle for collecting 
                exudate, and dressings for the purposes of wound 
                therapy; and
                    ``(B) a substitute for, and used in lieu of, a

                collection canister, and dressings that would otherwise 
                be covered for individuals for such wound therapy.
            ``(3) Payment amount.--The Secretary shall establish the 
        separate payment amount for an applicable disposable device 
        such that such amount is equal to--
                    ``(A) for 2017, 2018, and 2019, the greater of--

                        Level I Healthcare Common Procedure Coding 
                        System (HCPCS) code for which the description 
                        for a professional service includes the 
                        furnishing of such device; or

    (b) Conforming Amendments.--
            (1) Coinsurance.--Section 1833(a)(1) of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1)) is amended--

                (2) of section 1834(s)) furnished to an individual 
                pursuant to paragraph (1) of such section, the amount

                actual charge or the amount determined under paragraph 
                (3) of such section''.
            (2) Home health.--Section 1861(m)(5) of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(m)(5)) is amended by inserting ``and

                    (A) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United 
                States shall conduct a study on the value of disposable 
                devices to the Medicare program and Medicare 
                beneficiaries and the role of disposable devices as 
                substitutes for durable medical equipment. Such study 
                shall address the following:
                            (i) The types of disposable devices that 
                        could potentially qualify as being substitutes 
                        for durable medical equipment under the 
                        Medicare program, the similarities and 
                        differences between such disposable devices and 
                        the durable medical equipment for which they 
                        would be a substitute, and the extent to which 
                        other payers, including the Medicaid program 
                        and private payers, cover such disposable 
                        devices.
                            (ii) Views of, and information from, 
                        medical device manufacturers, providers of 
                        services, and suppliers on the incentives and 
                        disincentives under current Medicare coverage 
                        and payment policies for disposable devices 
                        that are substitutes for durable medical 
                        equipment and how such policies affect 
                        manufacturers' decisions to develop innovative 
                        products and providers' and suppliers' 
                        decisions to use such products.
                            (iii) Implications of expanding coverage 
                        under the Medicare program to include 
                        additional disposable devices that are 
                        substitutes for durable medical equipment.
                            (iv) Payment methodologies that could be 
                        used to pay for disposable devices that are 
                        substitutes for durable medical equipment other 
                        than applicable disposable devices pursuant to 
                        the amendments made by subsections (a) and (b).
                            (v) Other applicable areas determined
