            (2) Property.--The Commission may lease space and acquire 
        personal property to the extent funds are available.
    (h) Duties of the Commission.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct a review of 
        the Code of Federal Regulations to identify rules and sets of 
        rules that collectively implement a regulatory program that 
        should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the 
        economy. The Commission shall give priority in the review to 
        rules or sets of rules that are major rules or include major 
        rules, have been in effect more than 15 years, impose paperwork 
        burdens that could be reduced substantially without 
        significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, impose 
        disproportionately high costs on entities that qualify as small 
        entities within the meaning of section 601(6) of title 5, 
        United States Code, or could be strengthened in their 
        effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. The Commission 
        shall have as a goal of the Commission to achieve a reduction 
        of at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of Federal 
        regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall 
        effectiveness of such regulation.
            (2) Nature of review.--To identify which rules and sets of 
        rules should be repealed to lower the cost of regulation to the 
        economy, the Commission shall apply the following criteria:
                    (A) Whether the original purpose of the rule or set 
                of rules was achieved, and the rule or set of rules 
                could be repealed without significant recurrence of 
                adverse effects or conduct that the rule or set of 
                rules was intended to prevent or reduce.
                    (B) Whether the implementation, compliance, 
                administration, enforcement or other costs of the rule 
                or set of rules to the economy are not justified by the 
                benefits to society within the United States produced 
                by the expenditure of those costs.
                    (C) Whether the rule or set of rules has been 
                rendered unnecessary or obsolete, taking into 
                consideration the length of time since the rule was 
                made and the degree to which technology, economic 
                conditions, market practices, or other relevant factors 
                have changed in the subject area affected by the rule 
                or set of rules.
                    (D) Whether the rule or set of rules is ineffective 
                at achieving the purposes of the rule or set of rules.
                    (E) Whether the rule or set of rules overlaps, 
                duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal rules, and 
                to the extent feasible, with State and local 
                governmental rules.
                    (F) Whether the rule or set of rules has excessive 
                compliance costs or is otherwise excessively 
                burdensome, as compared to alternatives that--
                            (i) specify performance objectives rather 
                        than conduct or manners of compliance;
                            (ii) establish economic incentives to 
                        encourage desired behavior;
                            (iii) provide information upon which 
                        choices can be made by the public;
                            (iv) incorporate other innovative 
                        alternatives rather than agency actions that 
                        specify conduct or manners of compliance; or
                            (v) could in other ways substantially lower 
                        costs without significantly undermining 
                        effectiveness.
                    (G) Whether the rule or set of rules inhibits 
                innovation in or growth of the United States economy, 
                such as by impeding the introduction or use of safer or 
                equally safe technology that is newer or more efficient 
                than technology required by or permissible under the 
                rule or set of rules.
                    (H) Whether or not the rule or set of rules harms 
                competition within the United States economy or the 
                international economic competitiveness of enterprises 
                or entities based in the United States.
                    (I) Such other criteria as the Commission devises 
                to identify rules and sets of rules that can be 
                repealed to eliminate or reduce unnecessarily 
                burdensome costs to the United States economy.
            (3) Methodology for review.--The Commission shall establish 
        a methodology for conducting the review under this subsection 
        (including an overall review and discrete reviews of portions 
        of the Code of Federal Regulations), identifying rules and sets 
        of rules, and classifying rules under this subsection and 
        publish the terms of the methodology in the Federal Register 
        and on the website of the Commission. The Commission may 
        propose and seek public comment on the methodology before the 
        methodology is established.
            (4) Classification of rules and sets of rules.--
                    (A) In general.--After completion of any review of 
                rules or sets of rules under paragraph (2), the 
                Commission shall classify each rule or set of rules 
                identified in the review to qualify for recommended 
                repeal as either a rule or set of rules--
                            (i) on which immediate action to repeal is 
                        recommended; or
                            (ii) that should be eligible for repeal 
                        under regulatory cut-go procedures under title 
                        II.
                    (B) Decisions by majority.--Each decision by the 
                Commission to identify a rule or set of rules for 
                classification under this paragraph, and each decision 
                whether to classify the rule or set of rules under 
                clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), shall be made 
                by a simple majority vote of the Commission. No such 
                vote shall take place until after all members of the 
                Commission have been confirmed by the Senate.
            (5) Initiation of review by other persons.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commission may also conduct a 
                review under paragraph (2) of, and, if appropriate,

                        demonstrate that the rule or set of rules 
                        qualifies to be identified for repeal under the 
                        criteria listed in paragraph (2); and
                            (iii) such other information as the 
                        submitter believes may be helpful to the 
                        Commission's review, including a statement of 
                        the interest of the submitter in the matter.

                each submission received under this paragraph available 
                on the website of the Commission as soon as possible, 
                but not later than 1 week after the date on which the 
                submission was received.
    (i) Notices and Reports of the Commission.--
            (1) Notices of and reports on activities.--The Commission 
        shall publish, in the Federal Register and on the website of 
        the Commission--
                    (A) notices in advance of all public meetings, 
                hearings, and classifications under subsection (h) 
                informing the public of the basis, purpose, and 
                procedures for the meeting, hearing, or classification; 
                and
                    (B) reports after the conclusion of any public

                (h) summarizing in detail the basis, purpose, and 
                substance of the meeting, hearing, or classification.
            (2) Annual reports to congress.--Each year, beginning on 
        the date that is 1 year after the date on which all Commission 
        members have been confirmed by the Senate, the Commission shall 
        submit a report simultaneously to each House of Congress 
        detailing the activities of the Commission for the previous 
        year, and listing all rules and sets of rules classified under 
        subsection (h) during that year. For each rule or set of rules 
        so listed, the Commission shall--
                    (A) identify the agency that made the rule or set 
                of rules;
                    (B) identify the annual cost of the rule or set of 
                rules to the United States economy and the basis upon 
                which the Commission identified that cost;
                    (C) identify whether the rule or set of rules was 
                classified under clause (i) or clause (ii) of 
                subsection (h)(4)(A);
                    (D) identify the criteria under subsection (h)(2) 
                that caused the classification of the rule or set of 
                rules and the basis upon which the Commission 
                determined that those criteria were met;
                    (E) for each rule or set of rules listed under the 
                criteria set forth in subparagraph (B), (D), (F), (G), 
                or (H) of subsection (h)(2), or other criteria 
                established by the Commission under subparagraph (I) of 
                such subsection under which the Commission evaluated 
                alternatives to the rule or set of rules that could 
                lead to lower regulatory costs, identify alternatives 
                to the rule or set of rules that the Commission 
                recommends the agency consider as replacements for the 
                rule or set of rules and the basis on which the 
                Commission rests the recommendations, and, in 
                identifying such alternatives, emphasize alternatives 
                that will achieve regulatory effectiveness at the 
                lowest cost and with the lowest adverse impacts on 
                jobs;
                    (F) for each rule or set of rules listed under the 
                criteria set forth in subsection (h)(2)(E), the other 
                Federal, State, or local governmental rules that the 
                Commission found the rule or set of rules to overlap, 
                duplicate, or conflict with, and the basis for the 
                findings of the Commission; and
                    (G) in the case of each set of rules so listed, 
                analyze whether Congress should also consider repeal of 
                the statutory authority implemented by the set of 
                rules.
            (3) Final report.--Not later than the date on which the 
        Commission members' appointments expire, the Commission shall 
        submit a final report simultaneously to each House of Congress 
        summarizing all activities and recommendations of the 
        Commission, including a list of all rules or sets of rules the 
        Commission classified under clause (i) of subsection (h)(4)(A) 
        for immediate action to repeal, a separate list of all rules or 
        sets of rules the Commission classified under clause (ii) of 
        subsection (h)(4)(A) for repeal, and with regard to each rule 
        or set of rules listed on either list, the information 
        described in subparagraphs (A) through (F) of subsection 
        (h)(2). This report may be included in the final annual report 
        of the Commission under paragraph (2) and may include the 
        Commission's recommendation whether the Commission should be 
        reauthorized by Congress.

                action to repeal and newly listed as such in an annual 
                or final report of the Commission under paragraph (2) 
                or (3) of subsection (i) shall repeal the rule or set 
                of rules as recommended by the Commission within 60 
                days after the enactment of a joint resolution under 
                paragraph (2) for approval of the recommendations of

                repeal a rule or set of rules classified by the 
                Commission under subsection (h)(4)(A)(ii) for repeal 
                and newly listed as such in an annual or final report 
                of the Commission under paragraph (2) or (3) of 
                subsection (i) shall repeal the rule or set of rules as 
                recommended by the Commission pursuant to section 201, 
                following the enactment of a joint resolution under 
                paragraph (2) for approval of the recommendations of 
                the Commission in the report.

                            (i) which is introduced after the date on 
                        which the Commission transmits to Congress

                        of which is only as follows: ``That Congress 
                        approves the recommendations for repeal of the 
                        Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission as 
                        submitted by the Commission on ____'', the 
                        blank space being filled in with the 
                        appropriate date; and

                than 5 session days after the date on which a House of 
                Congress receives a report transmitted to Congress 
                under paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (i), the 
                majority leader of that House (or his or her respective 
                designee) shall introduce, by request, a joint 
                resolution described in subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Referral of joint resolution.--
                            (i) In general.--A joint resolution 
                        introduced under subparagraph (B) shall be

                                the Senate, in the case of a joint 
                                resolution introduced in the Senate; 
                                and

                                House of Representatives.
                            (ii) Report to full house.--Not later than 
                        30 days after the date on which a joint 
                        resolution is introduced under subparagraph 
                        (B), the committees to which the joint 
                        resolution has been referred under clause (i) 
                        shall each report the joint resolution--
                                    (I) without any revision or 
                                amendment; and
                                    (II) with a favorable 
                                recommendation, an unfavorable 
                                recommendation, or without 
                                recommendation.
                            (iii) Failure to report.--If a committee 
                        fails to report a joint resolution within the 
                        period described in clause (ii), the committee 
                        shall be automatically discharged from 
                        consideration of the joint resolution and the 
                        joint resolution shall be placed on the 
                        appropriate calendar.
                    (D) Senate procedures.--
                            (i) In general.--In the Senate, when the 
                        committee to which a joint resolution described 
                        in subparagraph (A) is referred has reported 
                        the joint resolution under subparagraph 
                        (C)(ii), or when the committee is discharged 
                        under subparagraph (C)(iii) from further 
                        consideration of the joint resolution, it is at 
                        any time thereafter in order for a motion to 
                        proceed to consideration of the joint 
                        resolution, and all points of order against the 
                        joint resolution and against consideration of 
                        the joint resolution are waived.
                            (ii) Debate on motion to proceed.--In the 
                        Senate, the motion to proceed to the joint 
                        resolution is non-debatable and is not subject 
                        to amendment, a motion to postpone, or to a 
                        motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                        business. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
                        which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to 
                        shall not be in order. A vote on the motion to 
                        proceed shall occur upon the expiration or 
                        yielding back of the time for debate without 
                        any further debate or any intervening motion or 
                        other action. Repeated motions to proceed to 
                        the joint resolution are in order, if 
                        necessary. If a motion to proceed to the 
                        consideration of the joint resolution is agreed 
                        to, the joint resolution shall remain the 
                        unfinished business of the Senate until 
                        disposed of.
                            (iii) Debate on joint resolution.--In the 
                        Senate, debate on the joint resolution shall be 
                        limited to not more than 30 hours, which shall 
                        be divided equally between those favoring and 
                        those opposing the joint resolution. An 
                        amendment to the joint resolution or any 
                        motion, including a motion to recommit, is not 
                        in order.
                            (iv) Vote on final passage.--In the Senate, 
                        the third reading of the joint resolution shall 
                        be considered to have occurred and a vote on 
                        final passage shall occur immediately upon the 
                        expiration or yielding back of the time for 
                        debate without any intervening motion or other 
                        action.
                            (v) Veto override.--
                                    (I) In general.--If the President 
                                vetoes a joint resolution described in 
                                subparagraph (A), in the Senate, upon 
                                receipt of the veto message from the 
                                President or the House of 
                                Representatives, the veto message shall 
                                be considered as read, printed in the 
                                Congressional Record, and entered in 
                                the Senate Journal. The Senate shall 
                                immediately proceed to consideration of 
                                whether to pass the joint resolution, 
                                the objections of the President 
                                notwithstanding.
                                    (II) Debate.--In the Senate, debate 
                                on a veto message shall be limited to 
                                not more than 30 hours, which shall be 
                                divided equally between those favoring 
                                and those opposing the joint 
                                resolution, and any motion, including a 
                                motion to table, to refer to a 
                                committee, or to proceed to another 
                                measure, is not in order.
                                    (III) Vote.--In the Senate, a vote

                        committee of the receiving House to which the 
                        joint resolution would have been referred to 
                        under subparagraph (C)(i) had reported the 
                        joint resolution under subparagraph (C)(ii) or 
                        was discharged from consideration of the joint

                201 may not be reissued in substantially the same form, 
                and a new rule that is substantially the same as such a 
                rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new rule 
                is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the 
                date of the joint resolution approving the 
                recommendation of the Commission to repeal the original 
                rule.

                shall assure that--
                            (i) the new rule does not result in the 
                        same adverse effects of the repealed rule that 
                        caused the Commission to recommend to Congress 
                        the repeal of the latter; and
                            (ii) the new rule will not result in new

202, or subsection (b) of this section, when an agency makes a new 
rule, the agency shall repeal rules or sets of rules of that agency 
classified by the Commission under section 101(h)(4)(A)(ii), such that 
the annual costs of the new rule to the United States economy is offset 
by such repeals, in an amount equal to or greater than the cost of the

        a rule or set of rules under paragraph (1) and thereby reduces 
        the annual, inflation-adjusted cost of the rule or set of rules 
        to the United States economy, the agency may thereafter apply 
        the reduction in regulatory costs, based on the regulatory cost 
        reductions of repeal identified by the Commission, to meet, in 
        whole or in part, the regulatory cost reduction required under 
        subsection (a) to be made at the time the agency promulgates a 
        new rule.
    (c) Achievement of Full Net Cost Reductions.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph

        same statutory authority as the new rule or set of rules.
            (2) Limitation.--When using the authority provided in 
        paragraph (1), the agency shall achieve a net reduction in 
        costs imposed by the body of rules of the agency (including the 
        new rule or set of rules) that is equal to or greater than the 
        cost of the new rule or set of rules to be promulgated, 
        including, whenever necessary, by repealing additional rules of 
        the agency listed by the Commission under section

regulatory costs to the economy.
