                        that agreement;
                    (B) ensure that loans and grants are provided, and 
                amounts are used, in a manner that results in 
                geographical diversity throughout the United States and 
                within States, territories, and Indian tribal land 
                among photovoltaic solar electricity generating 
                facilities installed using the assistance provided 
                under this section;
                    (C) to the maximum extent practicable, expand

                                    (I) low photovoltaic solar 
                                penetration; or
                                    (II) areas with a higher cost 
                                burden with respect to the deployment 
                                or installation of photovoltaic solar 
                                electricity generating facilities;
                            (ii) rural communities;
                            (iii) Indian tribes; and

                        (expressed in megawatts) as may be established 
                        by the Secretary, taking into consideration the 
                        costs associated with carrying out loan or 
                        grant obligations in the areas in which the

                has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary 
                that a longer period, not to exceed 3 years after the 
                date of initial distribution, is necessary to deliver 
                proposed services;
                    (C) for a loan provided under this section, 
                establish--
                            (i) an interest rate equal to the then-
                        current cost of funds to the Department of the 
                        Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity 
                        to the loan; and
                            (ii) a payout time that maximizes the 
                        savings to customers during the effective
