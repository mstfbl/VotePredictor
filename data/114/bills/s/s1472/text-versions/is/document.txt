                        `qualifying low-income consumer' have the 
                        meanings given those terms in section 54.400 of 
                        title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any 
                        successor thereto;

                        forth under sections 54.400 through 54.417 of 
                        title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any

                        Internet service provider' means a provider of 
                        broadband Internet access service that elects 
                        to participate in the Lifeline program to 
                        provide broadband Internet access service to

                        rule adopted under subparagraph (C)(i).
                    ``(B) Purpose.--The purpose of this paragraph is to 
                promote the adoption of broadband Internet access 
                service by all people of the United States while 
                recognizing that the price of broadband Internet access 
                service is one of the barriers to adoption for low-
                income households.
                    ``(C) Establishment.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Not later than 270 days 
                        after the date of enactment of the Broadband 
                        Adoption Act of 2015, the Commission shall 
                        adopt a final rule establishing Lifeline 
                        support under the Lifeline program for 
                        broadband Internet access service to enable 
                        qualifying low-income consumers in urban and 
                        rural areas to purchase broadband Internet 
                        access service at reduced charges by 
                        reimbursing participating broadband Internet 
                        access service providers for each such consumer 
                        served.
                            ``(ii) Model.--The final rule adopted under 
                        clause (i) shall provide that a qualifying low-
                        income consumer may elect to apply Lifeline 
                        support under the Lifeline program to basic 
                        telephone service, voice telephony service, or 
                        broadband Internet access service, regardless 
                        of whether the service is purchased as a stand-
                        alone service or as part of a bundle of 
                        services.
                            ``(iii) Digital literacy program.--The 
                        Commission shall consider providing a 
                        preference to a participating broadband 
                        Internet access service provider that includes 
                        components involving digital literacy programs 
                        as part of the offerings of the participating 
                        broadband Internet access service provider.
                    ``(D) State funds.--The Commission shall consult 
                with the Federal-State Joint Board instituted under 
                subsection (a)(1) regarding ways to encourage States to 
                develop programs that would work in conjunction with 
                the Lifeline program.

                        final rule adopted under subparagraph (C)(i),
