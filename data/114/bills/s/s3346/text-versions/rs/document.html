&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUSTAINING NATIONAL SPACE 
              COMMITMENTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the United States, in collaboration with its 
        international, academic, and industry partners, should sustain 
        and build upon our national space commitments and investments 
        across Administrations with a continuity of purpose to advance 
        recent achievements of space exploration and space science to 
        extend humanity's reach into deep space, including cis-lunar 
        space, the Moon, the surface and moons of Mars, and 
        beyond;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in 
        the United States space program by continuing to develop a 
        balanced portfolio for space exploration and space science, 
        including continued development of the Space Launch System, 
        Orion, Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services, the 
        James Webb Space Telescope, and the ongoing operations of the 
        International Space Station;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) a national, government-led space program that 
        builds on current science and exploration programs and advances 
        human knowledge and capabilities and opens the frontier beyond 
        Earth for ourselves, our international partners, commercial 
        enterprise, and science is of critical importance to our 
        national destiny and to a future guided by United States values 
        and freedoms;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution 
        of core NASA programs are essential for efficient use of 
        resources in pursuit of timely and tangible 
        accomplishments;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and 
        effectiveness by working with industry to streamline existing 
        programs and requirements, procurement practices, institutional 
        footprint, and bureaucracy while preserving effective program 
        oversight, accountability, and safety;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) United States Government astronauts changed 
        the trajectory of human history toward the promise of the 
        stars, and it is imperative that the United States maintain and 
        enhance its leadership in space exploration and continue to 
        expand freedom and opportunities in space for all Americans 
        that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) NASA is and should remain a multimission 
        agency with a balanced and robust set of core missions in 
        science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight and 
        exploration, and education.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 202. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Challenges of the past, such as the 
        cancellation of major programs, have disrupted completion of 
        major space systems thereby--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) impeding planning and pursuit of 
                national objectives in human space 
                exploration;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) placing the Nation's investment in 
                space exploration at risk; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) degrading the aerospace industrial 
                base.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et 
        seq.) reflects a broad, bipartisan agreement on the path 
        forward for NASA's core missions in science, space technology, 
        aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, and education, 
        which serves as the foundation for the policy updates by this 
        Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Sustaining the investment and maximizing 
        utilization of the ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our 
        international and industry partners is--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) consistent with the goals and 
                objectives of the United States space program; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) imperative to continuing United States 
                global leadership in human space exploration, science, 
                research, technology development, and education 
                opportunities that contribute to development of the 
                next generation of American scientists, engineers, and 
                leaders, and to creating the opportunity for economic 
                development of low-Earth orbit.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) NASA has made measurable progress in 
        development and testing of the Space Launch System and Orion 
        exploration systems with the near-term objectives of the 
        initial integrated test flight and launch in 2018, a human 
        mission in 2021, and continued missions in cis-lunar space and 
        eventually to the surface of Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The Commercial Crew Program is on schedule to 
        reestablish the capability to launch United States government 
        astronauts from United States soil into orbit by the end of 
        2018.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 
        2015 Annual Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns 
        over the potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that 
        could accompany significant changes to core NASA 
        programs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

  &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH 
                            ORBIT&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 301. OPERATION OF THE ISS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in 
        low-Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and 
        operate safely;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) expansion of partnerships, scientific 
        research, commercial applications, and exploration testbed 
        capabilities of the ISS is essential to ensuring the greatest 
        return on investments made by the United States and its 
        international space partners in the development, assembly, and 
        operations of that unique facility;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) stable and successful Commercial Cargo and 
        Commercial Crew programs are critical to ensuring timely 
        provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the capability to 
        launch United States government astronauts from United States 
        soil into orbit;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) sustaining United States leadership and 
        progress in human space exploration is enabled by continuing 
        utilization of the ISS--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) to facilitate the commercialization 
                and economic development of low-Earth orbit;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to serve as a testbed for 
                technologies, and to conduct scientific research and 
                development; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) as an orbital facility enabling 
                research upon--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the health, well-being, and 
                        performance of humans in space; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) the development of in-space 
                        systems enabling human space exploration beyond 
                        low-Earth orbit;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the Administrator should continue to support 
        the development of the Commercial Crew Program as planned to 
        end reliance upon Russian transport of United States government 
        astronauts to the ISS which has not been possible since the 
        retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the ISS should continue to provide a platform 
        for fundamental, microgravity, discovery-based space life and 
        physical sciences research that is critical for enabling space 
        exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways 
        for commercial space development that depend on advances in 
        basic research, and contribute to advancing science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics research.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Continuation of the ISS.--Congress reaffirms the 
policy set forth in section 501 of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18351) that it 
shall be the policy of the United States, in consultation with its 
international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete 
utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 302. TRANSPORTATION TO ISS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew and Commercial 
Cargo Programs.--It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) NASA should build upon the success of the 
        Commercial Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial 
        Resupply Services programs that have allowed private sector 
        companies to partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific 
        experiments to the ISS since 2012;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) once certified to meet NASA's safety and 
        reliability requirements and fully operational to meet ISS crew 
        transfer needs, the Commercial Crew Program transportation 
        systems should serve as the primary means of transporting 
        United States government astronauts and international partner 
        astronauts from United States soil to and from the 
        ISS;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Commercial Crew Program transportation systems 
        should have the capability of serving as ISS emergency crew 
        rescue vehicles;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has 
        enabled significant modernization and infrastructure 
        improvements as launch sites across the United States to 
        support NASA's Commercial Resupply Services and other civil and 
        commercial space flight missions; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should 
        be continued in a manner that leverages State and private 
        investments to achieve the goals of the program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) United States Policy.--It is the policy of the United 
States that, to foster the competitive development, operation, 
improvement and commercial availability of space transportation 
services, services for Federal Government access to and return from the 
ISS, whenever practicable, shall be procured via fair and open 
competition for well-defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition 
Regulation-based contracts under section 201(a) of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 
U.S.C. 18311(a)).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Commercial Cargo Program.--Section 401 of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 
U.S.C. 18341) is amended by striking ``Commercial Orbital 
Transportation Services'' and inserting ``Commercial Resupply 
Services''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Crew Safety.--The Administrator shall protect the 
safety of United States crews by ensuring commercial crew systems meet

403(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18342(b)(1)).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 303. ISS TRANSITION PLAN.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that NASA has been both the 
primary supplier and consumer of human space flight capabilities and 
services of the ISS and in low-Earth orbit.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
an orderly transition is needed for United States human space flight 
activities in low-Earth orbit from the current regime, that relies 
heavily on NASA sponsorship, to a regime where NASA is one of many 
customers of a low-Earth orbit commercial human space flight 
enterprise.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Reports.--Section 50111 of title 51, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(c) ISS Transition Plan.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, in 
        coordination with the ISS management entity, ISS partners, the 
        scientific user community, and the commercial space sector 
        shall develop a plan to transition in a step-wise approach from 
        the current regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a 
        regime where NASA is one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit 
        commercial human space flight enterprise.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

          &lt;DELETED&gt;Subtitle B--Assuring Core Capabilities for 
                         Exploration&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 421. SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM AND ORION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) NASA has made steady progress in developing 
        and testing the Space Launch System and Orion exploration 
        systems with the successful Exploration Flight Test of Orion in 
        December of 2014, the final qualification test firing of the 5-
        segment Space Launch System boosters in June 2016, and a full 
        thrust, full duration test firing of the RS-25 Space Launch 
        System core stage engine in August 2016.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Through the 21st Century Launch Complex 
        program and Exploration Ground Systems (referred to in this 
        section as ``EGS'') programs, NASA has made significant 
        progress in transforming exploration ground systems 
        infrastructure to meet NASA's mission requirements for the 
        Space Launch System and Orion and to modernize NASA's launch 
        complexes to the benefit of the civil, defense, and commercial 
        space sectors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress on Space Launch System, Orion, and 
EGS.--It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) as the United States works to send humans on a 
        series of missions on or near Mars in the 2030s, the United 
        States national space program should continue to make progress 
        on its commitment by fully developing the Space Launch System, 
        Orion, and related exploration ground systems;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) using the Space Launch System and Orion for a 
        wide range of contemplated missions will facilitate the 
        national defense, science, and exploration objectives of the 
        United States; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) continuity of purpose within the Space Launch 
        System and Orion programs are imperative as NASA prepares for 
        the uncrewed mission, EM-1, planned for 2018 followed by the 
        crewed mission, EM-2, in cis-lunar space planned for 2021, and 
        for subsequent missions beginning with EM-3 extending into cis-
        lunar space and eventually to Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) In General.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Exploration missions.--The Administrator shall 
        continue development of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) an uncrewed exploration mission to 
                demonstrate the capability of both the Space Launch 
                System and Orion as an integrated system by 
                2018;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) a crewed exploration mission to 
                demonstrate the Space Launch System, including the Core 
                Stage and Exploration Upper Stages, and the crewed 
                Orion by 2021;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) subsequent missions beginning with EM-
                3 using the Space Launch System and Orion to extend 
                into cis-lunar space and eventually to Mars; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) development of a deep space habitat as 
                the next element in a deep space exploration 
                architecture along with the Space Launch System and 
                Orion.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Other uses.--The Administrator shall assess 
        the utility of the Space Launch System for use by the science 
        community and for other Federal Government launch needs, 
        including consideration of overall cost and schedule savings 
        from reduced transit times and increased science returns 
        enabled by the unique capabilities of the Space Launch 
        System.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

             &lt;DELETED&gt;Subtitle C--Journey to Mars&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 431. SPACE TECHNOLOGY INFUSION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
advancing propulsion technology would improve the efficiency of trips 
to Mars and could shorten travel time to Mars and reduce astronaut 
health risks, reduce radiation exposure, consumables, and mass of 
materials required for the journey.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that 
the Administrator shall develop technologies to support the 
Administration's core missions as described in section 2(3) of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
(42 U.S.C. 18301(3)) and support sustained investments in early stage 
innovation and fundamental research, and technologies to expand the 
boundaries of the national aerospace enterprise.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Propulsion Technologies.--A goal of propulsion 
technologies developed under subsection (b), shall be to significantly 
reduce human travel time to Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 432. FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
        (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, 
        Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core 
        capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and 
        published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report 
        entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches 
        for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included 
        leaders from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy 
        communities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) With input from the public, the Committee on 
        Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and 
        aspirational rationales for human space flight together 
        constitute a compelling case for continued national investment 
        and pursuit of human space exploration toward the horizon goal 
        of Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) According to the Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight, the rationales include economic benefits, national 
        security, national prestige, inspiring students and other 
        citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of 
        shared destiny.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed 
        that Mars is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space 
        flight program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended 
        that NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct 
        mission planning and technology development as needed to 
        achieve the long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of 
        Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth 
        orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars requires 
        early planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term 
        on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve 
        short-term and long-term goals and objectives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in 
        paragraph (1), there are several independently developed 
        reports or concepts that describe potential Mars architectures 
        or concepts and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human 
        space exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration 
        Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next 
        Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion 
        Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to 
        Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report 
        2016''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 433. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT AND 
              EXPLORATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth 
        orbit and advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s 
        requires early planning and timely decisions to be made in the 
        near-term on the necessary courses of action for commitments to 
        achieve short-term and long-term goals and 
        objectives;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) for strong and sustained United States 
        leadership, a need exists to advance a strategic framework, 
        addressing exploration objectives in collaboration with 
        international, academic, and industry partners;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward 
        a long-term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and 
        implementation would influence future development and 
        implementation; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) a strategic framework should begin with low-
        Earth orbit, then address progress beyond low-Earth orbit to 
        cis-lunar space in greater detail than future missions 
        ultimately aimed at human arrival and activities on or near 
        Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Strategic Framework.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a 
        strategic framework, including, a critical decision plan, to 
        expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, including to cis-
        lunar space, the moons of Mars, the surface of Mars, and 
        beyond.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Scope.--The strategic framework shall 
        include--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) an integrated set of exploration, 
                science, and other goals and objectives of a United 
                States human space exploration program with the long-
                term goal of human missions near to or on the surface 
                of Mars in the 2030s;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) opportunities for international, 
                academic, and industry partnerships for exploration-
                related systems, services, research, and technology if 
                those opportunities provide cost-savings, accelerate 
                program schedules, or otherwise benefit the exploration 
                objectives developed under subparagraph (A);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) precursor missions in cis-lunar space 
                and other missions or activities necessary to meet the 
                exploration objectives developed under subparagraph 
                (A);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) capabilities and technologies, 
                including the Space Launch System, Orion, a deep space 
                habitat, and other capabilities, that enable the 
                exploration objectives developed under subparagraph 
                (A);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) a description of how cis-lunar 
                elements, objectives, and activities advance the human 
                exploration of Mars;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) an assessment of potential human 
                health and other risks, including radiation exposure; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, 
                to address the risks identified in subparagraph 
                (F).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Considerations.--In developing the strategic 
        framework, the Administrator shall consider--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) using key exploration capabilities, 
                namely the Space Launch System and Orion;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) using existing commercially available 
                technologies and capabilities or those technologies and 
                capabilities being developed by industry for commercial 
                purposes;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) an organizational approach to ensure 
                collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission 
                Directorates under section 621, when 
                appropriate;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) building upon the initial uncrewed 
                mission, EM-1, and first crewed mission, EM-2, of the 
                Space Launch System and Orion to establish a 
                sustainable cadence of missions extending human 
                exploration missions into cis-lunar space;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) developing the precursor missions and 
                activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key 
                technologies and capabilities essential for achieving 
                human missions to Mars, including long-duration human 
                operations beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar 
                electric propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental 
                control life support systems, Mars lander and ascent 
                vehicle, entry, descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface 
                systems, and in-situ resource utilization;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) demonstrating and testing one or more 
                habitat modules in cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars 
                missions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price 
                partnerships, where practicable;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (H) collaborating with international, 
                academic, and industry partners, when 
                appropriate;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) risks to human health and sensitive 
                onboard technologies, including radiation 
                exposure;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (J) evaluating the risks identified 
                through research outcomes under the NASA Human Research 
                Program's Behavioral Health Element; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (K) the recommendations and ideas of 
                several independently developed reports or concepts 
                that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts 
                and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space 
                exploration, including the reports described under 
                section 432(8).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Critical decision plan on human space 
        exploration.--As part of the strategic framework, the 
        Administrator shall include a critical decision plan--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) identifying and defining key decisions 
                guiding human space exploration priorities and plans 
                that need to be made before June 30, 2020, including 
                decisions that may guide human space exploration 
                capability development, precursor missions, long-term 
                missions, and activities; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) defining decisions needed to maximize 
                efficiencies and resources for reaching the near, 
                intermediate, and long-term goals and objectives of 
                human space exploration.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Reports.--The Administrator shall submit an 
        initial strategic framework, including a critical decision 
        plan, to the appropriate committee of Congress before December 
        31, 2017, and an updated strategic framework biennially 
        thereafter.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 434. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT CAPABILITY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an 
advanced space suit capability that aligns with the crew needs for 
exploration enabled by the space launch system and Orion, including an 
evaluation of the merit of delivering the planned suit system for use 
on the ISS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Considerations.--In developing the detailed plan under 
subsection (a), the Administrator shall consider leveraging NASA's 
existing investments and technologies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 435. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT MISSION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid 
        Robotic Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost 
        no more than $1.25 billion, excluding launch and 
        operations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key 
        Decision Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect 
        Mission or approval for Phase B in mission 
        formulation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA 
        estimated that costs have grown to $1.4 billion excluding 
        launch and operations for a launch in December 2021 and the 
        agency must evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce 
        the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within 
        the cost cap set by the Administrator.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) issued a finding that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) high-performance solar 
                        electric propulsion will likely be an important 
                        part of an architecture to send humans to Mars; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) maneuvering a large test mass 
                        is not necessary to provide a valid in-space 
                        test of a new solar electric propulsion 
                        stage;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) determined that a solar electric 
                propulsion mission will contribute more directly to the 
                goal of sending humans to Mars if the mission is 
                focused entirely on development and validation of the 
                solar electric propulsion stage; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) determined that other possible 
                motivations for acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, 
                such as asteroid science and planetary defense, do not 
                have value commensurate with their probable 
                cost.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is 
        competing for resources with other critical exploration 
        development programs, including the Space Launch System, Orion, 
        commercial crew, and a habitation module.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended 
        that NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment 
        of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) NASA completed the assessment under paragraph 
        (6) and reviewed it as part of the agency's Key Decision Point-
        B review.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended 
        that NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program 
        needed to be descoped:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Development of high power solar 
                electric propulsion.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity 
                environment in deep space.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA 
        Advisory Council expressed its concern to NASA about the 
        potential for growing costs for the program and highlighted 
        that choices would need to be made about the program's 
        content.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the technological and scientific goals of the 
        Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission may not be commensurate with 
        the cost; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost 
        effective and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate 
        the technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would 
        otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect 
        Mission.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) conduct an evaluation of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid 
                Robotic Redirect Mission for demonstrating the 
                technologies and capabilities needed for a human 
                mission to Mars that would otherwise be demonstrated by 
                the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the scientific and technical benefits 
                of the alternatives approaches identified in 
                subparagraph (A) compared to the Asteroid Redirect 
                Robotic Mission to future human exploration;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the commercial benefits of the 
                alternative approaches identified in subparagraph (A), 
                including the impact on the development of domestic 
                solar electric propulsion technology to bolster United 
                States competitiveness in the global marketplace; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of 
                the alternative approaches identified in subparagraph 
                (A); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) submit to the appropriate Committees of 
        Congress a report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), 
        including any recommendations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

  &lt;DELETED&gt;Subtitle D--Scott Kelly Human Spaceflight and Exploration 
                             Act&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Scott Kelly Human 
Spaceflight and Exploration Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Human space exploration can pose significant 
        challenges and is full of substantial risk, which has 
        ultimately claimed the lives of 24 National Aeronautics and 
        Space Administration astronauts serving in the line of 
        duty.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) As United States government astronauts 
        participate in long-duration and exploration spaceflight 
        missions they may experience increased health risks, such as 
        vision impairment, bone demineralization, and behavioral health 
        and performance risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic 
        radiation. Exposure to high levels of radiation and 
        microgravity can result in acute and long-term health 
        consequences that can increase the risk of cancer and tissue 
        degeneration and have potential effects on the musculoskeletal 
        system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune 
        function, and vision.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and 
        exploration spaceflight missions, United States government 
        astronaut Scott Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in 
        space while his identical twin brother, former United States 
        government astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control 
        specimen on Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, 
        behavioral, microbiological, and molecular reaction of the 
        human body to an extended period of time in space.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Since the Administration currently provides 
        medical monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States 
        government astronauts during their active employment, given the 
        unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration space 
        exploration, the Administration has requested statutory 
        authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, 
        diagnosis, and treatment to former crewmembers of human space 
        flights for psychological and medical conditions associated 
        with human space flight.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the United States should continue to seek the 
        unknown and lead the world in space exploration and scientific 
        discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration and 
        exploration spaceflight in deep space and an eventual mission 
        to Mars;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will 
        become increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of 
        many diseases humans face on Earth;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the Administration should provide the type of 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection 
        (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to 
        the training or exposure to the spaceflight environment of 
        crewmembers of human space flights and should not require any 
        former crewmembers to participate in the Administration's 
        monitoring;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment 
        should not replace a former crewmember's private health 
        insurance;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, 
        diagnosis, and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, 
        inform the requirements for new spaceflight medical hardware, 
        and develop controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in 
        the astronaut corps;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the Administration's existing radiation 
        exposure standards, which have been used for missions 
        pertaining to the Space Shuttle and the ISS, would limit 
        missions to durations of 150 to 250 days and would pose 
        significant challenges to long-duration or exploration 
        spaceflight or a multiyear mission to Mars; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly 
        aboard the ISS--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United 
                States for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the 
                mission generated new insight into how the human body 
                adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and 
                the stress of long-duration space flight; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) will help support the physical and 
                mental well-being of astronauts during longer space 
                exploration missions in the future.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 443. MEDICAL MONITORING AND RESEARCH RELATING TO HUMAN

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 502. PLANETARY SCIENCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Administration support for planetary science 
        is critical to enabling greater understanding of the solar 
        system and the origin of the Earth;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the United States leads the world in planetary 
        science and can augment its success in that area with 
        appropriate international, academic, and industry 
        partnerships;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) a mix of small, medium, and large planetary 
        science missions is required to sustain a steady cadence of 
        planetary exploration; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) robotic planetary exploration is a key 
        component of preparing for future human exploration.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Mission Priorities.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--In accordance with the priorities 
        established in the most recent decadal survey for planetary 
        science, the Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent

        may seek, if necessary, adjustments to mission priorities, 
        schedule, and scope in light of changing budget 
        projections.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 503. JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the James Webb Space Telescope should 
        significantly advance our understanding of star and planet 
        formation, improve our knowledge of the early universe, and 
        support United States leadership in astrophysics; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) consistent with annual Government 
        Accountability Office reviews of the James Webb Space Telescope 
        program, the Administrator should continue robust surveillance 
        of the performance of the James Webb Space Telescope project 
        and continue to improve the reliability of cost estimates and 
        contractor performance data and other major spaceflight 
        projects in order to enhance NASA's ability to successfully 
        deliver the James Webb Space Telescope on-time and within 
        budget.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 504. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WIDE-FIELD INFRARED SURVEY 
              TELESCOPE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope 
        (commonly known as ``WFIRST'') mission has the potential to 
        enable scientific discoveries that will transform our 
        understanding of the universe; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Administrator, to the extent practicable, 
        should make progress on the technologies and capabilities 
        needed to position the Administration to meet the objectives, 
        as outlined in the 2010 National Academies' Astronomy and 
        Astrophysics Decadal Survey, in a way that maximizes the 
        scientific productivity of meeting those objectives for the 
        resources invested.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 505. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARS 2020 ROVER.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Mars 2020 mission, to develop a Mars rover 
        and to enable the return of samples to Earth, should remain a 
        priority for NASA; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Mars 2020 mission--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) should significantly increase our 
                understanding of Mars;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) should help determine whether life 
                previously existed on that planet; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) should provide opportunities to gather 
                knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the 
                challenges of future human expeditions to 
                Mars.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 506. EUROPA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Studies of Europa, Jupiter's moon, indicate 
        that Europa may provide a habitable environment, as it contains 
        key ingredients known to support life on Earth, including 
        liquid water, heat, chemistry, and time.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) In 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope, 
        NASA scientists observed water vapor around the south polar 
        region of Europa, which provides potential evidence of water 
        plumes in that region.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) For decades, the Europa mission has 
        consistently ranked as a high priority mission for the 
        scientific community.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The Europa mission was ranked as the top 
        priority mission in the previous Planetary Science Decadal 
        Survey and ranked as the second-highest priority in the current 
        Planetary Science Decadal Survey.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Europa mission could provide another 
        avenue in which to capitalize on our Nation's current 
        investment in the Space Launch System that would significantly 
        reduce the transit time for such a deep space mission; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) a scientific, robotic exploration mission to 
        Europa, as prioritized in both Planetary Science Decadal 
        Surveys, should be supported.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) provide an information technology program 
        management framework to increase the efficiency and 
        effectiveness of information technology investments, including 
        relying on metrics for identifying and reducing potential 
        duplication, waste, and cost;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) establish a monetary threshold for all agency 
        information technology investments and related contracts, 
        including non-highly and highly specialized and specialized 
        information technology, regardless of the procurement 
        instrument, over which the NASA Chief Information Officer shall

        investments and spending, including information technology-
        related investments included as part of activities within NASA 
        mission directorates that may not be considered information 
        technology, to ensure investments are recognized and reported 
        appropriately based on guidance from the Office of Management 
        and Budget;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) consider appropriate revisions to the charters 
        of information technology boards and councils that inform 
        information technology investment and operation decisions; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) consider whether the Chief Information Officer 
        should have a seat on any boards or councils described in 
        paragraph (8).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 622. NASA LAUNCH CAPABILITIES COLLABORATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Launch Services Program is responsible for 
        the acquisition, management, and technical oversight of 
        commercial launch services for NASA's science and robotic 
        missions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The Commercial Crew Program is responsible for 
        the acquisition, management, and technical oversight of 
        commercial crew transportation systems.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The Launch Services Program and Commercial 
        Crew Program have worked together to gain exceptional technical 
        insight into the contracted launch service providers that are 
        common to both programs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The Launch Services Program has a long history 
        of oversight of 12 different launch vehicles and over 80 
        launches.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Co-location of the Launch Services Program and 
        Commercial Crew Program has enabled the Commercial Crew Program 
        to efficiently obtain the launch vehicle technical expertise of 
        and provide engineering and analytical support to the 
        Commercial Crew Program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Launch Services Program and Commercial 
        Crew Program each benefit from communication and coordination 
        of launch manifests, technical information, and common launch 
        vehicle insight between the programs; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) such communication and coordination is enabled 
        by the co-location of the programs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) In General.--The Administrator shall pursue a strategy 
for acquisition of crewed transportation services and non-crewed launch 
services that continues to enhance communication, collaboration, and 
coordination between the Launch Services Program and the Commercial 
Crew Program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 623. COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH COOPERATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Finding.--Congress recognized the benefit of 
commercial space launch cooperation between the Federal Government and 
the private sector when it granted the Secretary of Defense authority 
to foster cooperation between the Department of Defense and certain 
covered entities relating to space transportation infrastructure under 
section 2276 of title 10, United States Code.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) In General.--Chapter 505 of title 51, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 50507. Commercial launch cooperation&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Authority for Agreements Relating to Space 
Transportation Infrastructure.--Notwithstanding section 50504, the

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 624. DETECTION AND AVOIDANCE OF COUNTERFEIT 
              PARTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) A 2012 investigation by the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the Senate of counterfeit electronic parts in the 
        Department of Defense supply chain from 2009 through 2010 
        uncovered 1,800 cases and over one million counterfeit parts 
        and exposed the threat such counterfeit parts pose to service 
        members and national security.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Since 2010, the Comptroller General of the 
        United States has identified in 3 separate reports the risks 
        and challenges associated with counterfeit parts and 
        counterfeit prevention at both the Department of Defense and 
        NASA, including inconsistent definitions of counterfeit parts, 
        poorly targeted quality control practices, and potential 
        barriers to improvements to these practices.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the presence of counterfeit electronic parts in the NASA supply chain 
poses a danger to United States government astronauts, crew, and other 
personnel and a risk to the agency overall.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Regulations.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall revise 
        the NASA Supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to 
        improve the detection and avoidance of counterfeit electronic 
        parts in the supply chain.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Contractor responsibilities.--In revising the 
        regulations under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) require each covered contractor--
                &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) to detect and avoid the use or 
                        inclusion of any counterfeit parts in 
                        electronic parts or products that contain 
                        electronic parts; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) to take such corrective 
                        actions as the Administrator considers 
                        necessary to remedy the use or inclusion 
                        described in clause (i);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) including a subcontractor, 
                        to notify the applicable NASA contracting 
                        officer not later than 30 calendar days after 
                        the date the covered contractor becomes aware, 
                        or has reason to suspect, that any end item, 
                        component, part or material contained in 
                        supplies purchased by NASA, or purchased by a 
                        covered contractor or subcontractor for 
                        delivery to, or on behalf of, NASA, contains a 
                        counterfeit electronic part or suspect 
                        counterfeit electronic part;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) prohibit the cost of counterfeit 
                electronic parts, suspect counterfeit electronic parts, 
                and any corrective action described under subparagraph 
                (A)(ii) from being included as allowable costs under 
                agency contracts, unless--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the covered contractor has an 
                        operational system to detect and avoid 
                        counterfeit electronic parts and suspect 
                        counterfeit electronic parts that has been 
                        reviewed and approved by NASA or the Department 
                        of Defense; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) the covered contractor has 
                        provided the notice under subparagraph 
                        (A)(iii); or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) the counterfeit electronic 
                        parts or suspect counterfeit electronic parts 
                        were provided to the covered contractor as

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Suppliers of electronic parts.--In revising 
        the regulations under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) require NASA and covered contractors, 
                including subcontractors, at all tiers--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.) reflects a 
        broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's core 
        missions in science, space technology, aeronautics, human space 
        flight and exploration, and education, which serves as the 
        foundation for the policy updates by this Act.
            (3) Sustaining the investment and maximizing utilization of 
        the ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and 
        industry partners is--
                    (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the 
                United States space program; and
                    (B) imperative to continuing United States global 
                leadership in human space exploration, science, 
                research, technology development, and education 
                opportunities that contribute to development of the 
                next generation of American scientists, engineers, and 
                leaders, and to creating the opportunity for economic 
                development of low-Earth orbit.
            (4) NASA has made measurable progress in development and 
        testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration 
        systems with the near-term objectives of the initial integrated 
        test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in 2021, and 
        continued missions with an annual cadence in cis-lunar space 
        and eventually to the surface of Mars.
            (5) The Commercial Crew Program is on schedule to 
        reestablish the capability to launch United States government 
        astronauts from United States soil into low-Earth orbit by the 
        end of 2018.
            (6) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual 
        Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the 
        potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could 
        accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.

    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-
        Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and 
        operate safely;
            (2) expansion of partnerships, scientific research, 
        commercial applications, and exploration testbed capabilities 
        of the ISS is essential to ensuring the greatest return on 
        investments made by the United States and its international 
        space partners in the development, assembly, and operations of 
        that unique facility;
            (3) a stable and successful Commercial Resupply Services 
        Program and Commercial Crew Program are critical to ensuring 
        timely provisioning of the ISS and to reestablishing the 
        capability to launch United States government astronauts from 
        United States soil into low-Earth orbit;
            (4) sustaining United States leadership and progress in 
        human space exploration is enabled in part by continuing 
        utilization of the ISS--
                    (A) to facilitate the commercialization and 
                economic development of low-Earth orbit;
                    (B) to serve as a testbed for technologies, and to 
                conduct scientific research and development; and
                    (C) as an orbital facility enabling research upon--
                            (i) the health, well-being, and performance 
                        of humans in space; and
                            (ii) the development of in-space systems 
                        enabling human space exploration beyond low-
                        Earth orbit;
            (5) the Administrator should continue to support the 
        development of the Commercial Crew Program as planned to end 
        reliance upon Russian transport of United States government 
        astronauts to the ISS which has not been possible since the 
        retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011; and
            (6) the ISS should continue to provide a platform for 
        fundamental, microgravity, discovery-based space life and 
        physical sciences research that is critical for enabling space 
        exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways 
        for commercial space development that depend on advances in 
        basic research, and contribute to advancing science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics research.
    (b) Continuation of the ISS.--Congress reaffirms the policy set 
forth in section 501 of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18351) that it 
shall be the policy of the United States, in consultation with its 
international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete 
utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.

SEC. 302. TRANSPORTATION TO ISS.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew Program and Commercial 
Resupply Services Program.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial 
        Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply 
        Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to 
        partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments 
        to the ISS since 2012;
            (2) once certified to meet NASA's safety and reliability 
        requirements and fully operational to meet ISS crew transfer 
        needs, the Commercial Crew Program transportation systems 
        should serve as the primary means of transporting United States 
        government astronauts and international partner astronauts from 
        United States soil to and from the ISS;
            (3) Commercial Crew Program transportation systems should 
        have the capability of serving as ISS emergency crew rescue 
        vehicles;
            (4) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled 
        significant modernization and infrastructure improvements at 
        launch sites across the United States to support NASA's 
        Commercial Resupply Services Program and other civil and 
        commercial space flight missions; and
            (5) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be 
        continued in a manner that leverages State and private 
        investments to achieve the goals of the program.
    (b) United States Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that, to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement and 
commercial availability of space transportation services, services for 
Federal Government access to and return from the ISS, whenever 
practicable, shall be procured via fair and open competition for well-
defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based 
contracts under section 201(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18311(a)).
    (c) Commercial Cargo Program.--Section 401 of the National

SEC. 303. ISS TRANSITION PLAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that NASA has been both the primary 
supplier and consumer of human space flight capabilities and services 
of the ISS and in low-Earth orbit.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an orderly 
transition is needed for United States human space flight activities in 
low-Earth orbit from the current regime, that relies heavily on NASA 
sponsorship, to a regime where NASA is one of many customers of a low-
Earth orbit commercial human space flight enterprise.
    (c) Reports.--Section 50111 of title 51, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) ISS Transition Plan.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, in coordination with 
        the ISS management entity, ISS partners, the scientific user 
        community, and the commercial space sector, shall develop a

        regime that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime 
        where NASA is one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit 
        commercial human space flight enterprise.

         Subtitle B--Assuring Core Capabilities for Exploration

SEC. 421. SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM AND ORION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) NASA has made steady progress in developing and testing 
        the Space Launch System and Orion exploration systems with the 
        successful Exploration Flight Test of Orion in December of 
        2014, the final qualification test firing of the 5-segment 
        Space Launch System boosters in June 2016, and a full thrust, 
        full duration test firing of the RS-25 Space Launch System core 
        stage engine in August 2016.
            (2) Through the 21st Century Launch Complex program and 
        Exploration Ground Systems programs, NASA has made significant 
        progress in transforming exploration ground systems 
        infrastructure to meet NASA's mission requirements for the 
        Space Launch System and Orion and to modernize NASA's launch 
        complexes to the benefit of the civil, defense, and commercial 
        space sectors.
    (b) Sense of Congress on Space Launch System, Orion, and 
Exploration Ground Systems.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) as the United States works to send humans on a series 
        of missions on or near Mars in the 2030s, the United States 
        national space program should continue to make progress on its 
        commitment by fully developing the Space Launch System, Orion, 
        and related Exploration Ground Systems;
            (2) using the Space Launch System and Orion for a wide 
        range of contemplated missions will facilitate the national 
        defense, science, and exploration objectives of the United 
        States; and
            (3) the United States should have continuity of purpose for 
        Space Launch System and Orion in deep space exploration 
        missions, using them beginning with the uncrewed mission, EM-1, 
        planned for 2018, followed by the crewed mission, EM-2, in cis-
        lunar space planned for 2021, and for subsequent missions 
        beginning with EM-3 extending into cis-lunar space and 
        eventually to Mars.
    (c) In General.--
            (1) Exploration missions.--The Administrator shall continue 
        development of--
                    (A) an uncrewed exploration mission to demonstrate 
                the capability of both the Space Launch System and 
                Orion as an integrated system by 2018;
                    (B) a crewed exploration mission to demonstrate the 
                Space Launch System, including the Core Stage and 
                Exploration Upper Stages, and the crewed Orion mission 
                by 2021;
                    (C) subsequent missions beginning with EM-3 using 
                the Space Launch System and Orion to extend into cis-
                lunar space and eventually to Mars; and
                    (D) a deep space habitat as the next element in a 
                deep space exploration architecture along with the 
                Space Launch System and Orion.
            (2) Other uses.--The Administrator shall assess the utility 
        of the Space Launch System for use by the science community and 
        for other Federal Government launch needs, including 
        consideration of overall cost and schedule savings from reduced 
        transit times and increased science returns enabled by the 
        unique capabilities of the Space Launch System.

                      Subtitle C--Journey to Mars

SEC. 431. SPACE TECHNOLOGY INFUSION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that advancing 
propulsion technology would improve the efficiency of trips to Mars and 
could shorten travel time to Mars, reduce astronaut health risks, and 
reduce radiation exposure, consumables, and mass of materials required 
for the journey.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that the 
Administrator shall develop technologies to support the 
Administration's core missions, as described in section 2(3) of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
(42 U.S.C. 18301(3)), and support sustained investments in early stage 
innovation, fundamental research, and technologies to expand the 
boundaries of the national aerospace enterprise.
    (c) Propulsion Technologies.--A goal of propulsion technologies 
developed under subsection (b) shall be to significantly reduce human 
travel time to Mars.

SEC. 432. FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
        (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, 
        Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core 
        capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and 
        published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report 
        entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches 
        for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.
            (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders 
        from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy 
        communities.
            (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational 
        rationales for human space flight together constitute a 
        compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit 
        of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars.
            (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the 
        rationales include economic benefits, national security, 
        national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens, 
        scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared 
        destiny.
            (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars 
        is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight 
        program.
            (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that 
        NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission 
        planning and technology development as needed to achieve the 
        long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.
            (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and 
        advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early planning 
        and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on the 
        necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve short-
        term and long-term goals and objectives.
            (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph 
        (1), there are several independently developed reports or 
        concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts 
        and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space 
        exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration 
        Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next 
        Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion 
        Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to 
        Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report 
        2016''.

SEC. 433. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT AND EXPLORATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and 
        advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires 
        early planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term 
        on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve 
        short-term and long-term goals and objectives;
            (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a 
        need exists to advance a strategic framework, addressing 
        exploration objectives in collaboration with international, 
        academic, and industry partners;
            (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-
        term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and 
        implementation would influence future development and 
        implementation; and
            (4) a strategic framework should begin with low-Earth 
        orbit, then address progress beyond low-Earth orbit to cis-
        lunar space in greater detail, and then address future missions 
        ultimately aimed at human arrival and activities on or near 
        Mars.
    (b) Strategic Framework.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a 
        strategic framework, including a critical decision plan, to 
        expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, including to cis-
        lunar space, the moons of Mars, the surface of Mars, and 
        beyond.
            (2) Scope.--The strategic framework shall include--
                    (A) an integrated set of exploration, science, and 
                other goals and objectives of a United States human 
                space exploration program with the long-term goal of 
                human missions near to or on the surface of Mars in the 
                2030s;
                    (B) opportunities for international, academic, and 
                industry partnerships for exploration-related systems, 
                services, research, and technology if those 
                opportunities provide cost-savings, accelerate program 
                schedules, or otherwise benefit the exploration 
                objectives developed under subparagraph (A);
                    (C) precursor missions in cis-lunar space and other 
                missions or activities necessary to meet the 
                exploration objectives developed under subparagraph 
                (A), including anticipated timelines and missions for 
                the Space Launch System and Orion;
                    (D) capabilities and technologies, including the 
                Space Launch System, Orion, a deep space habitat, and 
                other capabilities, that enable the exploration 
                objectives developed under subparagraph (A);
                    (E) a description of how cis-lunar elements, 
                objectives, and activities advance the human 
                exploration of Mars;
                    (F) an assessment of potential human health and 
                other risks, including radiation exposure; and
                    (G) mitigation plans, whenever possible, to address 
                the risks identified in subparagraph (F).
            (3) Considerations.--In developing the strategic framework, 
        the Administrator shall consider--
                    (A) using key exploration capabilities, namely the 
                Space Launch System and Orion;
                    (B) using existing commercially available 
                technologies and capabilities or those technologies and 
                capabilities being developed by industry for commercial 
                purposes;
                    (C) an organizational approach to ensure 
                collaboration and coordination among NASA's Mission 
                Directorates under section 621, when appropriate, 
                including to collect and return to Earth a sample from 
                the Martian surface;
                    (D) building upon the initial uncrewed mission, EM-
                1, and first crewed mission, EM-2, of the Space Launch 
                System and Orion to establish a sustainable cadence of 
                missions extending human exploration missions into cis-
                lunar space, including anticipated timelines and 
                milestones;
                    (E) developing the precursor missions and 
                activities that will demonstrate, test, and develop key 
                technologies and capabilities essential for achieving 
                human missions to Mars, including long-duration human 
                operations beyond low-Earth orbit, space suits, solar 
                electric propulsion, deep space habitats, environmental 
                control life support systems, Mars lander and ascent 
                vehicle, entry, descent, landing, ascent, Mars surface 
                systems, and in-situ resource utilization;
                    (F) demonstrating and testing 1 or more habitat 
                modules in cis-lunar space to prepare for Mars 
                missions;
                    (G) using public-private, firm fixed-price 
                partnerships, where practicable;
                    (H) collaborating with international, academic, and 
                industry partners, when appropriate;
                    (I) risks to human health and sensitive onboard 
                technologies, including radiation exposure;
                    (J) evaluating the risks identified through 
                research outcomes under the NASA Human Research 
                Program's Behavioral Health Element; and
                    (K) the recommendations and ideas of several 
                independently developed reports or concepts that 
                describe potential Mars architectures or concepts and 
                identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space 
                exploration, including the reports described under 
                section 432(8).
            (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As 
        part of the strategic framework, the Administrator shall 
        include a critical decision plan--
                    (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding 
                human space exploration priorities and plans that need 
                to be made before June 30, 2020, including decisions 
                that may guide human space exploration capability 
                development, precursor missions, long-term missions, 
                and activities;
                    (B) defining decisions needed to maximize 
                efficiencies and resources for reaching the near, 
                intermediate, and long-term goals and objectives of 
                human space exploration; and
                    (C) identifying and defining timelines and 
                milestones for a sustainable cadence of missions 
                beginning with EM-3 for the Space Launch System and 
                Orion to extend human exploration from cis-lunar space 
                to the surface of Mars.
            (5) Reports.--The Administrator shall submit an initial 
        strategic framework, including a critical decision plan, to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress before December 1, 2017, and 
        an updated strategic framework biennially thereafter.

SEC. 434. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT CAPABILITY.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a 
detailed plan for achieving an advanced space suit capability that 
aligns with the crew needs for exploration enabled by the Space Launch 
System and Orion, including an evaluation of the merit of delivering 
the planned suit system for use on the ISS.

SEC. 435. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT MISSION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic 
        Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no more 
        than $1,250,000,000, excluding launch and operations.
            (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision 
        Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or 
        approval for Phase B in mission formulation.
            (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated 
        that costs have grown to $1,400,000,000 excluding launch and 
        operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must 
        evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the Asteroid 
        Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within the cost cap 
        set by the Administrator.
            (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--
                    (A) issued a finding that--
                            (i) high-performance solar electric 
                        propulsion will likely be an important part of 
                        an architecture to send humans to Mars; and
                            (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not 
                        necessary to provide a valid in-space test of a 
                        new solar electric propulsion stage;
                    (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion 
                mission will contribute more directly to the goal of 
                sending humans to Mars if the mission is focused 
                entirely on development and validation of the solar 
                electric propulsion stage; and
                    (C) determined that other possible motivations for 
                acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid 
                science and planetary defense, do not have value 
                commensurate with their probable cost.
            (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for 
        resources with other critical exploration development programs, 
        including the Space Launch System, Orion, commercial crew, and 
        a habitation module.
            (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that 
        NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of 
        the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission.
            (7) NASA completed the assessment under paragraph (6) and 
        reviewed it as part of the agency's Key Decision Point-B 
        review.
            (8) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that 
        NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program 
        needed to be descoped:
                    (A) Development of high power solar electric 
                propulsion.
                    (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity 
                environment in deep space.
            (9) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory 
        Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for 
        growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices 
        would need to be made about the program's content.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid 
        Robotic Redirect Mission may not be commensurate with the cost; 
        and
            (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective 
        and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the 
        technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would 
        otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect 
        Mission.
    (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--
            (1) conduct an evaluation of--
                    (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic 
                Redirect Mission for demonstrating the technologies and 
                capabilities needed for a human mission to Mars that 
                would otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic 
                Redirect Mission;
                    (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the 
                alternatives approaches identified in subparagraph (A) 
                compared to the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission to 
                future human exploration;
                    (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative 
                approaches identified in subparagraph (A), including 
                the impact on the development of domestic solar 
                electric propulsion technology to bolster United States

     Subtitle D--Scott Kelly Human Spaceflight and Exploration Act

SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Scott Kelly Human Spaceflight 
and Exploration Act''.

SEC. 442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges 
        and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed 
        the lives of 24 National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        astronauts serving in the line of duty.
            (2) As United States government astronauts participate in 
        long-duration and exploration spaceflight missions they may 
        experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment, 
        bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance 
        risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation. 
        Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can 
        result in acute and long-term health consequences that can 
        increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have 
        potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central 
        nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and 
        vision.
            (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration 
        spaceflight missions, United States government astronaut Scott 
        Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his 
        identical twin brother, former United States government 
        astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on 
        Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, 
        microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to an 
        extended period of time in space.
            (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States 
        government astronauts during their active employment, given the 
        unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration space 
        exploration, the Administration has requested statutory 
        authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, 
        diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government 
        astronauts for psychological and medical conditions associated 
        with human space flight.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown 
        and lead the world in space exploration and scientific 
        discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration and 
        exploration spaceflight in deep space and an eventual mission 
        to Mars;
            (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become 
        increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many 
        diseases humans face on Earth;
            (3) the Administration should provide the type of 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection 
        (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to 
        the training or exposure to the spaceflight environment of 
        United States government astronauts and should not require any 
        former United States Government astronauts to participate in 
        the Administration's monitoring;
            (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not 
        replace a former United States government astronaut's private 
        health insurance;
            (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis, 
        and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the 
        requirements for new spaceflight medical hardware, and develop 
        controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in the 
        astronaut corps;
            (6) the Administration's existing radiation exposure 
        standards, which have been used for missions pertaining to the 
        Space Shuttle and the ISS, would limit missions to durations of 
        150 to 250 days and would pose significant challenges to long-
        duration or exploration spaceflight or a multiyear mission to 
        Mars; and
            (7) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the 
        ISS--
                    (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States 
                for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the 
                mission generated new insight into how the human body 
                adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and 
                the stress of long-duration space flight; and
                    (B) will help support the physical and mental well-
                being of astronauts during longer space exploration 
                missions in the future.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Mars 2020 mission, to develop a Mars rover and to 
        enable the return of samples to Earth, should remain a priority 
        for NASA; and
            (2) the Mars 2020 mission--
                    (A) should significantly increase our understanding 
                of Mars;
                    (B) should help determine whether life previously 
                existed on that planet; and
                    (C) should provide opportunities to gather 
                knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the 
                challenges of future human expeditions to Mars.

SEC. 506. EUROPA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Studies of Europa, Jupiter's moon, indicate that Europa 
        may provide a habitable environment, as it contains key 
        ingredients known to support life on Earth, including liquid 
        water, heat, chemistry, and time.
            (2) In 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA 
        scientists observed water vapor around the south polar region 
        of Europa, which provides potential evidence of water plumes in 
        that region.
            (3) For decades, the Europa mission has consistently ranked 
        as a high priority mission for the scientific community.
            (4) The Europa mission was ranked as the top priority 
        mission in the previous Planetary Science Decadal Survey and 
        ranked as the second-highest priority in the current Planetary 
        Science Decadal Survey.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Europa mission could provide another avenue in 
        which to capitalize on our Nation's current investment in the 
        Space Launch System that would significantly reduce the transit 
        time for such a deep space mission; and
            (2) a scientific, robotic exploration mission to Europa, as 
        prioritized in both Planetary Science Decadal Surveys, should 
        be supported.

SEC. 626. LEVERAGING COMMERCIAL SATELLITE SERVICING CAPABILITIES ACROSS 
              MISSION DIRECTORATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Refueling and relocating aging satellites to extend 
        their operational lifetimes is a capacity that NASA will 
        substantially benefit from and is important for lowering the 
        costs of ongoing scientific, national security, and commercial 
        satellite operations.
            (2) The technologies involved in satellite servicing, such 
        as dexterous robotic arms, propellant transfer systems, and 
        solar electric propulsion, are all critical capabilities to 
        support a human exploration mission to Mars.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) satellite servicing is a vital capability that will 
        bolster the capacity and affordability of NASA's ongoing 
        scientific and human exploration operations while 
        simultaneously enhancing the ability of domestic companies to 
        compete in the global marketplace; and
            (2) future NASA satellites and spacecraft across mission 
        directorates should be constructed in a manner that allows for 
        servicing in order to maximize operational longevity and 
        affordability.
    (c) Leveraging of Capabilities.--The Administrator shall identify 
orbital assets in both the Science Mission Directorate and the Human 
Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate that could benefit from 
satellite servicing-related technologies, and shall work across all 
NASA mission directorates to evaluate opportunities for the private 
sector to perform such services or advance technical capabilities by 
leveraging the technologies and techniques developed by NASA programs 
and other industry programs.

SEC. 627. FLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES.

    (a) Development of Payloads.--
            (1) In general.--In order to conduct necessary research, 
        the Administrator shall continue and, as the Administrator 
        considers appropriate, expand the development of technology 
        payloads for--
                    (A) scientific research; and
                    (B) investigating new or improved capabilities.
            (2) Funds.--For the purpose of carrying out paragraph (1), 
        the Administrator shall make funds available for--
                    (A) flight testing;
                    (B) payload development; and
                    (C) hardware related to subparagraphs (A) and (B).
    (b) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the 
Administrator should provide flight opportunities for payloads to 
microgravity environments and suborbital altitudes as authorized by 
section 907 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18405).

SEC. 628. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SMALL CLASS LAUNCH MISSIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Venture Class Launch Services contracts awarded under 
        the Launch Services Program will expand opportunities for 
        future dedicated launches of CubeSats and other small 
        satellites and small orbital science missions; and
            (2) principal investigator-led small orbital science 
        missions, including CubeSat class, Small Explorer (SMEX) class, 
        and Venture class, offer valuable opportunities to advance 
        science at low cost, train the next generation of scientists 
        and engineers, and enable participants to acquire skills in 
        systems engineering and systems integration that are critical 
        to maintaining the Nation's leadership in space and to 
        enhancing United States innovation and competitiveness abroad.
