    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States, in collaboration with its 
        international, academic, and industry partners, should sustain 
        and build upon our national space commitments and investments 
        across Administrations with a continuity of purpose to advance 
        recent achievements of space exploration and space science to 
        extend humanity's reach into deep space, including cis-lunar 
        space, the Moon, the surface and moons of Mars, and beyond;
            (2) NASA leaders can best leverage investments in the 
        United States space program by continuing to develop a balanced 
        portfolio for space exploration and space science, including 
        continued development of the Space Launch System, Orion, 
        Commercial Crew and Commercial Resupply Services, the James 
        Webb Space Telescope, and the ongoing operations of the 
        International Space Station;
            (3) a national, government-led space program that builds on 
        current science and exploration programs and advances human 
        knowledge and capabilities and opens the frontier beyond Earth 
        for ourselves, our international partners, commercial 
        enterprise, and science is of critical importance to our 
        national destiny and to a future guided by United States values 
        and freedoms;
            (4) continuity of purpose and effective execution of core 
        NASA programs are essential for efficient use of resources in 
        pursuit of timely and tangible accomplishments;
            (5) NASA could improve its efficiency and effectiveness by 
        working with industry to streamline existing programs and 
        requirements, procurement practices, institutional footprint, 
        and bureaucracy while preserving effective program oversight, 
        accountability, and safety;
            (6) United States Government astronauts changed the 
        trajectory of human history toward the promise of the stars, 
        and it is imperative that the United States maintain and 
        enhance its leadership in space exploration and continue to 
        expand freedom and opportunities in space for all Americans 
        that are consistent with the Constitution of the United States; 
        and
            (7) NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a

        technology, aeronautics, human space flight and exploration, 
        and education.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Challenges of the past, such as the cancellation of 
        major programs, have disrupted completion of major space 
        systems thereby--
                    (A) impeding planning and pursuit of national 
                objectives in human space exploration;
                    (B) placing the Nation's investment in space 
                exploration at risk; and
                    (C) degrading the aerospace industrial base.
            (2) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et seq.) reflects a 
        broad, bipartisan agreement on the path forward for NASA's core 
        missions in science, space technology, aeronautics, human space 
        flight and exploration, and education, which serves as the 
        foundation for the policy updates by this Act.
            (3) Sustaining the investment and maximizing utilization of 
        the ISS and ISS National Laboratory with our international and 
        industry partners is--
                    (A) consistent with the goals and objectives of the 
                United States space program; and
                    (B) imperative to continuing United States global 
                leadership in human space exploration, science, 
                research, technology development, and education 
                opportunities that contribute to development of the 
                next generation of American scientists, engineers, and 
                leaders, and to creating the opportunity for economic 
                development of low-Earth orbit.
            (4) NASA has made measurable progress in development and 
        testing of the Space Launch System and Orion exploration 
        systems with the near-term objectives of the initial integrated 
        test flight and launch in 2018, a human mission in 2021, and 
        continued missions in cis-lunar space and eventually to the 
        surface of Mars.
            (5) The Commercial Crew Program is on schedule to 
        reestablish the capability to launch United States government 
        astronauts from United States soil into orbit by the end of 
        2018.
            (6) The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, in its 2015 Annual 
        Report, urged continuity of purpose noting concerns over the 
        potential for cost overruns and schedule slips that could 
        accompany significant changes to core NASA programs.

    TITLE III--MAXIMIZING UTILIZATION OF THE ISS AND LOW-EARTH ORBIT

SEC. 301. OPERATION OF THE ISS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) after 15 years of continuous human presence in low-
        Earth orbit, the ISS continues to overcome challenges and 
        operate safely;
            (2) expansion of partnerships, scientific research, 
        commercial applications, and exploration testbed capabilities 
        of the ISS is essential to ensuring the greatest return on 
        investments made by the United States and its international 
        space partners in the development, assembly, and operations of 
        that unique facility;
            (3) stable and successful Commercial Cargo and Commercial 
        Crew programs are critical to ensuring timely provisioning of 
        the ISS and to reestablishing the capability to launch United 
        States government astronauts from United States soil into 
        orbit;
            (4) sustaining United States leadership and progress in 
        human space exploration is enabled by continuing utilization of 
        the ISS--
                    (A) to facilitate the commercialization and 
                economic development of low-Earth orbit;
                    (B) to serve as a testbed for technologies, and to 
                conduct scientific research and development; and
                    (C) as an orbital facility enabling research upon--
                            (i) the health, well-being, and performance 
                        of humans in space; and
                            (ii) the development of in-space systems 
                        enabling human space exploration beyond low-
                        Earth orbit;
            (5) the Administrator should continue to support the 
        development of the Commercial Crew Program as planned to end 
        reliance upon Russian transport of United States government 
        astronauts to the ISS which has not been possible since the 
        retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011; and
            (6) the ISS should continue to provide a platform for 
        fundamental, microgravity, discovery-based space life and 
        physical sciences research that is critical for enabling space 
        exploration, protecting humans in space, increasing pathways 
        for commercial space development that depend on advances in 
        basic research, and contribute to advancing science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics research.
    (b) Continuation of the ISS.--Congress reaffirms the policy set 
forth in section 501 of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18351) that it 
shall be the policy of the United States, in consultation with its 
international partners in the ISS program, to support full and complete 
utilization of the ISS through at least 2024.

SEC. 302. TRANSPORTATION TO ISS.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Commercial Crew and Commercial Cargo 
Programs.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) NASA should build upon the success of the Commercial 
        Orbital Transportation Services and Commercial Resupply 
        Services programs that have allowed private sector companies to 
        partner with NASA to deliver cargo and scientific experiments 
        to the ISS since 2012;
            (2) once certified to meet NASA's safety and reliability 
        requirements and fully operational to meet ISS crew transfer 
        needs, the Commercial Crew Program transportation systems 
        should serve as the primary means of transporting United States 
        government astronauts and international partner astronauts from 
        United States soil to and from the ISS;
            (3) Commercial Crew Program transportation systems should 
        have the capability of serving as ISS emergency crew rescue 
        vehicles;
            (4) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program has enabled 
        significant modernization and infrastructure improvements as 
        launch sites across the United States to support NASA's 
        Commercial Resupply Services and other civil and commercial 
        space flight missions; and
            (5) the 21st Century Launch Complex Program should be 
        continued in a manner that leverages State and private 
        investments to achieve the goals of the program.
    (b) United States Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that, to foster the competitive development, operation, improvement and 
commercial availability of space transportation services, services for 
Federal Government access to and return from the ISS, whenever 
practicable, shall be procured via fair and open competition for well-
defined, milestone-based, Federal Acquisition Regulation-based 
contracts under section 201(a) of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18311(a)).
    (c) Commercial Cargo Program.--Section 401 of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 
U.S.C. 18341) is amended by striking ``Commercial Orbital 
Transportation Services'' and inserting ``Commercial Resupply 
Services''.
    (d) Crew Safety.--The Administrator shall protect the safety of 
United States crews by ensuring commercial crew systems meet all 
applicable human rating requirements in accordance with section 
403(b)(1) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18342(b)(1)).

SEC. 303. ISS TRANSITION PLAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that NASA has been both the primary 
supplier and consumer of human space flight capabilities and services 
of the ISS and in low-Earth orbit.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an orderly 
transition is needed for United States human space flight activities in 
low-Earth orbit from the current regime, that relies heavily on NASA 
sponsorship, to a regime where NASA is one of many customers of a low-
Earth orbit commercial human space flight enterprise.
    (c) Reports.--Section 50111 of title 51, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) ISS Transition Plan.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator, in coordination with 
        the ISS management entity, ISS partners, the scientific user 
        community, and the commercial space sector shall develop a plan 
        to transition in a step-wise approach from the current regime 
        that relies heavily on NASA sponsorship to a regime where NASA 
        is one of many customers of a low-Earth orbit commercial human 
        space flight enterprise.
            ``(2) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration

         Subtitle B--Assuring Core Capabilities for Exploration

SEC. 421. SPACE LAUNCH SYSTEM AND ORION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) NASA has made steady progress in developing and testing 
        the Space Launch System and Orion exploration systems with the 
        successful Exploration Flight Test of Orion in December of 
        2014, the final qualification test firing of the 5-segment 
        Space Launch System boosters in June 2016, and a full thrust, 
        full duration test firing of the RS-25 Space Launch System core 
        stage engine in August 2016.
            (2) Through the 21st Century Launch Complex program and 
        Exploration Ground Systems (referred to in this section as 
        ``EGS'') programs, NASA has made significant progress in 
        transforming exploration ground systems infrastructure to meet 
        NASA's mission requirements for the Space Launch System and 
        Orion and to modernize NASA's launch complexes to the benefit 
        of the civil, defense, and commercial space sectors.
    (b) Sense of Congress on Space Launch System, Orion, and EGS.--It 
is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) as the United States works to send humans on a series 
        of missions on or near Mars in the 2030s, the United States 
        national space program should continue to make progress on its 
        commitment by fully developing the Space Launch System, Orion, 
        and related exploration ground systems;
            (2) using the Space Launch System and Orion for a wide 
        range of contemplated missions will facilitate the national 
        defense, science, and exploration objectives of the United 
        States; and
            (3) continuity of purpose within the Space Launch System 
        and Orion programs are imperative as NASA prepares for the 
        uncrewed mission, EM-1, planned for 2018 followed by the crewed 
        mission, EM-2, in cis-lunar space planned for 2021, and for 
        subsequent missions beginning with EM-3 extending into cis-
        lunar space and eventually to Mars.
    (c) In General.--
            (1) Exploration missions.--The Administrator shall continue 
        development of--
                    (A) an uncrewed exploration mission to demonstrate 
                the capability of both the Space Launch System and 
                Orion as an integrated system by 2018;
                    (B) a crewed exploration mission to demonstrate the 
                Space Launch System, including the Core Stage and 
                Exploration Upper Stages, and the crewed Orion by 2021;
                    (C) subsequent missions beginning with EM-3 using 
                the Space Launch System and Orion to extend into cis-
                lunar space and eventually to Mars; and
                    (D) development of a deep space habitat as the next 
                element in a deep space exploration architecture along 
                with the Space Launch System and Orion.
            (2) Other uses.--The Administrator shall assess the utility 
        of the Space Launch System for use by the science community and 
        for other Federal Government launch needs, including 
        consideration of overall cost and schedule savings from reduced 
        transit times and increased science returns enabled by the 
        unique capabilities of the Space Launch System.

                      Subtitle C--Journey to Mars

SEC. 431. SPACE TECHNOLOGY INFUSION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that advancing 
propulsion technology would improve the efficiency of trips to Mars and 
could shorten travel time to Mars and reduce astronaut health risks, 
reduce radiation exposure, consumables, and mass of materials required 
for the journey.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that the 
Administrator shall develop technologies to support the 
Administration's core missions as described in section 2(3) of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
(42 U.S.C. 18301(3)) and support sustained investments in early stage 
innovation and fundamental research, and technologies to expand the 
boundaries of the national aerospace enterprise.
    (c) Propulsion Technologies.--A goal of propulsion technologies 
developed under subsection (b), shall be to significantly reduce human 
travel time to Mars.

SEC. 432. FINDINGS ON HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 
        (124 Stat. 2813), the National Academies of Sciences, 
        Engineering, and Medicine, through its Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core 
        capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and 
        published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report 
        entitled, ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches 
        for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.
            (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders 
        from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy 
        communities.
            (3) With input from the public, the Committee on Human 
        Spaceflight concluded that many practical and aspirational 
        rationales for human space flight together constitute a 
        compelling case for continued national investment and pursuit 
        of human space exploration toward the horizon goal of Mars.
            (4) According to the Committee on Human Spaceflight, the 
        rationales include economic benefits, national security, 
        national prestige, inspiring students and other citizens, 
        scientific discovery, human survival, and a sense of shared 
        destiny.
            (5) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars 
        is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight 
        program.
            (6) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that 
        NASA define a series of sustainable steps and conduct mission 
        planning and technology development as needed to achieve the 
        long-term goal of placing humans on the surface of Mars.
            (7) Expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and 
        advancing toward human missions to Mars requires early planning 
        and timely decisions to be made in the near-term on the 
        necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve short-
        term and long-term goals and objectives.
            (8) In addition to the 2014 report described in paragraph 
        (1), there are several independently developed reports or 
        concepts that describe potential Mars architectures or concepts 
        and identify Mars as the long-term goal for human space 
        exploration, including NASA's ``The Global Exploration 
        Roadmap'' of 2013, ``NASA's Journey to Mars-Pioneering Next 
        Steps in Space Exploration'' of 2015, NASA Jet Propulsion 
        Laboratory's ``Minimal Architecture for Human Journeys to 
        Mars'' of 2015, and Explore Mars' ``The Humans to Mars Report 
        2016''.

SEC. 433. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN SPACEFLIGHT AND EXPLORATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit and 
        advancing toward human missions to Mars in the 2030s requires 
        early planning and timely decisions to be made in the near-term 
        on the necessary courses of action for commitments to achieve 
        short-term and long-term goals and objectives;
            (2) for strong and sustained United States leadership, a 
        need exists to advance a strategic framework, addressing 
        exploration objectives in collaboration with international, 
        academic, and industry partners;
            (3) an approach that incrementally advances toward a long-
        term goal is one in which nearer-term developments and 
        implementation would influence future development and 
        implementation; and
            (4) a strategic framework should begin with low-Earth 
        orbit, then address progress beyond low-Earth orbit to cis-
        lunar space in greater detail than future missions ultimately 
        aimed at human arrival and activities on or near Mars.
    (b) Strategic Framework.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall develop a 
        strategic framework, including, a critical decision plan, to 
        expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, including to cis-
        lunar space, the moons of Mars, the surface of Mars, and 
        beyond.
            (2) Scope.--The strategic framework shall include--

                space exploration program with the long-term goal of 
                human missions near to or on the surface of Mars in the 
                2030s;
                    (B) opportunities for international, academic, and 
                industry partnerships for exploration-related systems, 
                services, research, and technology if those 
                opportunities provide cost-savings, accelerate program 
                schedules, or otherwise benefit the exploration 
                objectives developed under subparagraph (A);
                    (C) precursor missions in cis-lunar space and other 
                missions or activities necessary to meet the 
                exploration objectives developed under subparagraph

                exploration, including the reports described under 
                section 432(8).
            (4) Critical decision plan on human space exploration.--As 
        part of the strategic framework, the Administrator shall 
        include a critical decision plan--
                    (A) identifying and defining key decisions guiding 
                human space exploration priorities and plans that need 
                to be made before June 30, 2020, including decisions 
                that may guide human space exploration capability 
                development, precursor missions, long-term missions, 
                and activities; and
                    (B) defining decisions needed to maximize 
                efficiencies and resources for reaching the near, 
                intermediate, and long-term goals and objectives of 
                human space exploration.
            (5) Reports.--The Administrator shall submit an initial 
        strategic framework, including a critical decision plan, to the 
        appropriate committee of Congress before December 31, 2017, and 
        an updated strategic framework biennially thereafter.

SEC. 434. ADVANCED SPACE SUIT CAPABILITY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate 
committees of Congress a detailed plan for achieving an advanced space 
suit capability that aligns with the crew needs for exploration enabled 
by the space launch system and Orion, including an evaluation of the 
merit of delivering the planned suit system for use on the ISS.
    (b) Considerations.--In developing the detailed plan under 
subsection (a), the Administrator shall consider leveraging NASA's 
existing investments and technologies.

SEC. 435. ASTEROID ROBOTIC REDIRECT MISSION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) NASA initially estimated that the Asteroid Robotic 
        Redirect Mission would launch in December 2020 and cost no more 
        than $1.25 billion, excluding launch and operations.
            (2) On July 15, 2016, NASA conducted its Key Decision 
        Point-B review of the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission or 
        approval for Phase B in mission formulation.
            (3) During the Key Decision Point-B review, NASA estimated 
        that costs have grown to $1.4 billion excluding launch and 
        operations for a launch in December 2021 and the agency must 
        evaluate whether to accept the increase or reduce the Asteroid 
        Robotic Redirect Mission's scope to stay within the cost cap 
        set by the Administrator.
            (4) In April 2015, the NASA Advisory Council--
                    (A) issued a finding that--
                            (i) high-performance solar electric 
                        propulsion will likely be an important part of 
                        an architecture to send humans to Mars; and
                            (ii) maneuvering a large test mass is not 
                        necessary to provide a valid in-space test of a 
                        new solar electric propulsion stage;
                    (B) determined that a solar electric propulsion 
                mission will contribute more directly to the goal of 
                sending humans to Mars if the mission is focused 
                entirely on development and validation of the solar 
                electric propulsion stage; and
                    (C) determined that other possible motivations for 
                acquiring and maneuvering a boulder, such as asteroid 
                science and planetary defense, do not have value 
                commensurate with their probable cost.
            (5) The Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission is competing for 
        resources with other critical exploration development programs, 
        including the Space Launch System, Orion, commercial crew, and 
        a habitation module.
            (6) In 2014, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that 
        NASA conduct an independent cost and technical assessment of 
        the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission.
            (7) NASA completed the assessment under paragraph (6) and 
        reviewed it as part of the agency's Key Decision Point-B 
        review.
            (8) In 2015, the NASA Advisory Council recommended that 
        NASA preserve the following key objectives if the program 
        needed to be descoped:
                    (A) Development of high power solar electric 
                propulsion.
                    (B) Ability to maneuver in a low gravity 
                environment in deep space.
            (9) In January 2015 and July 2015, the NASA Advisory 
        Council expressed its concern to NASA about the potential for 
        growing costs for the program and highlighted that choices 
        would need to be made about the program's content.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the technological and scientific goals of the Asteroid 
        Robotic Redirect Mission may not be commensurate with the cost; 
        and
            (2) alternative missions may provide a more cost effective 
        and scientifically beneficial means to demonstrate the 
        technologies needed for a human mission to Mars that would 
        otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect 
        Mission.
    (c) Evaluation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--
            (1) conduct an evaluation of--
                    (A) alternative approaches to the Asteroid Robotic 
                Redirect Mission for demonstrating the technologies and 
                capabilities needed for a human mission to Mars that 
                would otherwise be demonstrated by the Asteroid Robotic 
                Redirect Mission;
                    (B) the scientific and technical benefits of the 
                alternatives approaches identified in subparagraph (A) 
                compared to the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission to 
                future human exploration;
                    (C) the commercial benefits of the alternative 
                approaches identified in subparagraph (A), including 
                the impact on the development of domestic solar 
                electric propulsion technology to bolster United States 
                competitiveness in the global marketplace; and
                    (D) a comparison of the estimated costs of the 
                alternative approaches identified in subparagraph (A); 
                and
            (2) submit to the appropriate Committees of Congress a 
        report on the evaluation under paragraph (1), including any 
        recommendations.

     Subtitle D--Scott Kelly Human Spaceflight and Exploration Act

SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Scott Kelly Human Spaceflight 
and Exploration Act''.

SEC. 442. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges 
        and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed 
        the lives of 24 National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        astronauts serving in the line of duty.
            (2) As United States government astronauts participate in 
        long-duration and exploration spaceflight missions they may 
        experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment, 
        bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance 
        risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation. 
        Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can 
        result in acute and long-term health consequences that can 
        increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have 
        potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central 
        nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and 
        vision.
            (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration 
        spaceflight missions, United States government astronaut Scott 
        Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his 
        identical twin brother, former United States government 
        astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on 
        Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, 
        microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to an 
        extended period of time in space.
            (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States 
        government astronauts during their active employment, given the 
        unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration space 
        exploration, the Administration has requested statutory 
        authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, 
        diagnosis, and treatment to former crewmembers of human space 
        flights for psychological and medical conditions associated 
        with human space flight.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown 
        and lead the world in space exploration and scientific 
        discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration and 
        exploration spaceflight in deep space and an eventual mission 
        to Mars;
            (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become 
        increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many 
        diseases humans face on Earth;
            (3) the Administration should provide the type of 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection 
        (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to 
        the training or exposure to the spaceflight environment of 
        crewmembers of human space flights and should not require any 
        former crewmembers to participate in the Administration's 
        monitoring;
            (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not 
        replace a former crewmember's private health insurance;
            (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis, 
        and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the 
        requirements for new spaceflight medical hardware, and develop 
        controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in the 
        astronaut corps;
            (6) the Administration's existing radiation exposure 
        standards, which have been used for missions pertaining to the 
        Space Shuttle and the ISS, would limit missions to durations of 
        150 to 250 days and would pose significant challenges to long-
        duration or exploration spaceflight or a multiyear mission to 
        Mars; and
            (7) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the 
        ISS--
                    (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States 
                for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the 
                mission generated new insight into how the human body 
                adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and 
                the stress of long-duration space flight; and
                    (B) will help support the physical and mental well-
                being of astronauts during longer space exploration 
                missions in the future.

Congress'' and inserting ``Overall science portfolio''.

SEC. 502. PLANETARY SCIENCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Administration support for planetary science is 
        critical to enabling greater understanding of the solar system 
        and the origin of the Earth;
            (2) the United States leads the world in planetary science 
        and can augment its success in that area with appropriate 
        international, academic, and industry partnerships;
            (3) a mix of small, medium, and large planetary science 
        missions is required to sustain a steady cadence of planetary 
        exploration; and
            (4) robotic planetary exploration is a key component of 
        preparing for future human exploration.
    (b) Mission Priorities.--
            (1) In general.--In accordance with the priorities 
        established in the most recent decadal survey for planetary 
        science, the Administrator shall ensure, to the greatest extent 
        practicable, the completion of a balanced set of Discovery, New 
        Frontiers, and flagship missions.
            (2) Mission priority adjustments.--Consistent with the set 
        of missions described in paragraph (1), and while maintaining 
        the continuity of scientific data and steady development of 
        capabilities and technologies, the Administrator may seek, if 
        necessary, adjustments to mission priorities, schedule, and 
        scope in light of changing budget projections.

SEC. 503. JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the James Webb Space Telescope should significantly 
        advance our understanding of star and planet formation, improve 
        our knowledge of the early universe, and support United States 
        leadership in astrophysics; and
            (2) consistent with annual Government Accountability Office 
        reviews of the James Webb Space Telescope program, the 
        Administrator should continue robust surveillance of the 
        performance of the James Webb Space Telescope project and 
        continue to improve the reliability of cost estimates and 
        contractor performance data and other major spaceflight 
        projects in order to enhance NASA's ability to successfully 
        deliver the James Webb Space Telescope on-time and within 
        budget.

SEC. 504. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WIDE-FIELD INFRARED SURVEY TELESCOPE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (commonly 
        known as ``WFIRST'') mission has the potential to enable 
        scientific discoveries that will transform our understanding of 
        the universe; and
            (2) the Administrator, to the extent practicable, should 
        make progress on the technologies and capabilities needed to 
        position the Administration to meet the objectives, as outlined 
        in the 2010 National Academies' Astronomy and Astrophysics 
        Decadal Survey, in a way that maximizes the scientific 
        productivity of meeting those objectives for the resources 
        invested.

SEC. 505. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARS 2020 ROVER.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Mars 2020 mission, to develop a Mars rover and to 
        enable the return of samples to Earth, should remain a priority 
        for NASA; and
            (2) the Mars 2020 mission--
                    (A) should significantly increase our understanding 
                of Mars;
                    (B) should help determine whether life previously 
                existed on that planet; and
                    (C) should provide opportunities to gather 
                knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the 
                challenges of future human expeditions to Mars.

SEC. 506. EUROPA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Studies of Europa, Jupiter's moon, indicate that Europa 
        may provide a habitable environment, as it contains key 
        ingredients known to support life on Earth, including liquid 
        water, heat, chemistry, and time.
            (2) In 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope, NASA 
        scientists observed water vapor around the south polar region 
        of Europa, which provides potential evidence of water plumes in 
        that region.
            (3) For decades, the Europa mission has consistently ranked 
        as a high priority mission for the scientific community.
            (4) The Europa mission was ranked as the top priority 
        mission in the previous Planetary Science Decadal Survey and 
        ranked as the second-highest priority in the current Planetary 
        Science Decadal Survey.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Europa mission could provide another avenue in 
        which to capitalize on our Nation's current investment in the 
        Space Launch System that would significantly reduce the transit 
        time for such a deep space mission; and
            (2) a scientific, robotic exploration mission to Europa, as 
        prioritized in both Planetary Science Decadal Surveys, should 
        be supported.

SEC. 625. EDUCATION AND OUTREACH.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States competitiveness in the 21st century 
        requires engaging the science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (referred to in this section as ``STEM'') talent in 
        all States;
            (2) the Administration is uniquely positioned to educate 
        and inspire students and the broader public on STEM subjects 
        and careers;
            (3) the Administration's Education Mission Directorates, 
        along with the other mission directorates, have been effective 
        in delivering educational content because of the strong 
        engagement of Administration scientists and engineers in the 
        Administration's education and outreach activities; and
            (4) the Administration's education and outreach programs, 
        including the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive 
        Research (EPSCoR) and the Space Grant College and Fellowship 
        Program, reflect the Administration's successful commitment to 
        growing and diversifying the national science and engineering 
        workforce.
    (b) Continuation of Education and Outreach Activities and 
Programs.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall continue 
        engagement with the public and education opportunities for 
        students via all the Administration's mission directorates to 
        the maximum extent practicable.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress a report on the 
        Administration's near-term outreach plans for advancing space 
        law education.
