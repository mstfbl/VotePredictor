                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to replace the 
     current requirement for a biennial energy policy plan with a 
           Quadrennial Energy Review, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the President's Council of Advisors on Science and 
        Technology recommends that the United States develop a 
        governmentwide Federal energy policy and update the policy 
        regularly with strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews similar to 
        the reviews conducted by the Department of Defense and other 
        Federal agencies; and
            (2) the development of an energy policy resulting from a 
        Quadrennial Energy Review would--
                    (A) enhance the energy security of the United 
                States;
                    (B) create jobs; and
                    (C) mitigate environmental harm.
