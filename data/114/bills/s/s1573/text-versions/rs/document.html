                defined in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 
                1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001)) with an active meteorology

        on shift work in order to minimize stress on those employees,

        staffing during severe weather events;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) provide sufficient training to minimize

                Research Council considers necessary for public safety 
                purposes; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
