 To award grants to States for the development of innovative long-term 
                    services and supports programs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Living Independently for Extended 
Time Act'' or the ``LIFETIME Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The number of Americans over age 65 or living with a 
        disability is growing, and over 70 percent of these individuals 
        will need some form of long-term services and supports, with a 
        majority of individuals preferring home and community-based 
        care.
            (2) This is a major demographic shift and provides an 
        opportunity for innovative solutions in long-term services and 
        supports.
            (3) Developing programs to facilitate high-quality 
        independent community-based living, create and improve jobs, 
        and address and improve upon gaps in existing systems will be 
        essential to providing necessary services and supports to these 
        individuals and families.
            (4) It is imperative that Congress act to address the 
        looming long-term services and supports crisis.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this Act to establish a grant program to 
provide incentives to States for the development of solutions to the 
increased need of individuals for long-term services and supports and 
to increase State support and systems in long-term care.
