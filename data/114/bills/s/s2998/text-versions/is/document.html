    ``(e) Treatment of Breakthrough Devices Under Pay-for-Performance 
Programs.--
            ``(1) Pay-for-performance programs defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term `pay-for-performance programs' means, with 
        respect to items and services for which payment is made under 
        the applicable payment systems under this title, payment 
        initiatives designed to improve the quality, efficiency, and 
        overall value of health care furnished to individuals entitled 
        to benefits under part A or enrolled under part B through 
        financial incentives to providers of services and suppliers for 
        meeting or exceeding certain quality or performance measures or 
        through financial penalties on providers that fail to achieve 
        specified goals or cost savings, or both. Such term includes--
                    ``(A) the Medicare shared savings program under 
                established section 1899;
                    ``(B) shared savings programs tested by the Center 
                for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation under section 
                1115A, including the Pioneer ACO program;

                this title or under applicable authorities under title 
                XI.
            ``(2) Exclusion of additional costs of breakthrough 
        devices.--Insofar as the amount of payment for a breakthrough 
        device exceeds the amount of payment that the item or service 
        would otherwise receive under a pay-for-performance program for 
        which shared savings or shared losses are calculated, the 
        Secretary shall exclude from the calculation of such shared 
        savings or losses under such program for such period the amount 
        by which the payment for the breakthrough device involved 
        exceeds the payment amount for such other item or service that 
        would have been made but for the use of the breakthrough 
        device.

        breakthrough devices.--

                by a provider of services or supplier participating in 
                a pay-for-performance program of a breakthrough device 
                to an individual entitled to benefits under part A or 
                enrolled under part B and participating in such program 
                would result in such provider or supplier, with respect 
                to the condition and episode of care for which such 
                device is furnished, receiving a poor or failing score 
                for a quality measure under such program that measures 
                whether such provider or supplier gave the treatment 
                known to give the best results for most patients with a 
                particular condition (commonly known as a `clinical 
                process of care' measure), the Secretary shall exclude 
                such quality measure from any determination of whether 
                such provider or supplier met applicable quality 
                performance thresholds under such program with respect 
                to such condition and episode of care of such 
                individual.
                    ``(B) Inapplicability to clinical outcomes 
                measures.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) may be construed 
                to allow for the exclusion, with respect to a 
                breakthrough device furnished to an individual by a 
                provider or supplier under a pay-for-performance 
                program, of any quality measure designed to reflect the 
                results of care furnished to such individual by such 
                provider or supplier (commonly known as a `clinical 
                outcome' measure) from a determination described in 
                such subparagraph.''.

                not breakthrough devices for purposes of such section 
                1899C by reason of the limitation under subsection 
                (a)(2) of such section; and
                    (C) examine the impact of such limitation on access 
                to such devices for individuals entitled to benefits 
                under part A or enrolled in part B of title XVIII of 
                the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).
            (3) Report.--Not later than 6 years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a
