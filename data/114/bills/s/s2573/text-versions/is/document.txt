                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 
                taxpayers who remove lead-based hazards.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Home Lead Safety 
Tax Credit Act of 2016''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) Lead is a metal that can produce a wide range of health 
        effects in humans when ingested. Children are more vulnerable 
        to lead poisoning than adults.
            (2) Lead poisoning is a serious, entirely preventable 
        threat to a child's intelligence, behavior, and learning. In 
        severe cases, lead poisoning can result in death.
            (3) According to the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development, approximately 23 million housing units nationwide 
        have at least one lead paint hazard.
            (4) In fiscal year 2015, funding for Federal lead abatement 
        programs, such as the Lead Hazard Control Grant Program, only 
        provided for lead abatement or ``interim control measures'' for 
        18,600 homes.
            (5) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced by 
        the abatement or complete removal of all lead-based hazards. 
        Empirical studies also have shown substantial reductions in 
        lead poisoning when the affected properties have undergone 
        ``interim control measures'' that are less costly than 
        abatement.
    (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage the safe 
removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby decrease the number of 
children who suffer reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, 
behavioral problems, and other health consequences due to lead 
poisoning.

SEC. 2. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY TAX CREDIT.

    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after 
section 36B the following new section:

        for the taxable year an amount equal to 50 percent of the lead 
        hazard reduction activity cost paid or incurred by the taxpayer 
        during the taxable year for each eligible dwelling unit.
            ``(2) Election to apply costs to prior year.--For purposes 
        of this section, a taxpayer may elect to treat any lead hazard 
        reduction activity cost paid or incurred by the taxpayer during

        preceding taxable year.
    ``(b) Limitations.--
