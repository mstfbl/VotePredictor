enactment of this Act, and not less frequently than annually 
thereafter, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall provide for the 
conduct of inspections of kitchens and food service areas at each 
medical facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that 
the same standards for kitchens and food service areas at hospitals in

    (b) Agreement.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall seek to enter into an 
        agreement with the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
        Hospital Organizations under which the Joint Commission on 
        Accreditation of Hospital Organizations conducts the 
        inspections required under subsection (a).
            (2) Alternate organization.--If the Secretary is unable to 
        enter into an agreement described in paragraph (1) with the 
        Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations on 
        terms acceptable to the Secretary, the Secretary shall seek to 
        enter into such an agreement with another appropriate 
        organization that--
                    (A) is not part of the Federal Government;
                    (B) operates as a not-for-profit entity; and
                    (C) has expertise and objectivity comparable to 
                that of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of 
                Hospital Organizations.
    (c) Remediation Plan.--
            (1) Initial failure.--If a kitchen or food service area of 
        a medical facility of the Department is determined pursuant to 
        an inspection conducted under subsection (a) not to meet the 
        standards for kitchens and food service areas in hospitals in 
        the private sector, that medical facility fails the inspection 
        and the Secretary shall--
                    (A) implement a remediation plan for that medical 
                facility within 48 hours; and
                    (B) conduct a second inspection under subsection 
                (a) at that medical facility within 7 days of the 
                failed inspection.
            (2) Second failure.--If a medical facility of the 
        Department fails the second inspection conducted under 
        paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall close the kitchen or food 
        service area at that medical facility that did not meet the 
        standards for kitchens and food service areas in hospitals in 
        the private sector until remediation is completed and all 
        kitchens and food service areas at that medical facility meet 
        such standards.
            (3) Provision of food.--If a kitchen or food service area 
        is closed at a medical facility of the Department pursuant to 
        paragraph (2), the Director of the Veterans Integrated Service 
        Network in which the medical facility is located shall enter 
        into a contract with a vendor approved by the General Services 
        Administration to provide food at the medical facility.
    (d) Reports.--
            (1) Quarterly.--Not less frequently than quarterly, the

        submit to Congress a report on inspections conducted under this 
        section during that quarter at medical facilities of the 
        Department under the jurisdiction of that Director.
            (2) Subsequent period.--A Director of a Veterans Integrated 
        Service Network may submit to Congress the report described in 
        paragraph (1) not less frequently than semiannually if the 
        Director does not report any failed inspections for the one-
        year period preceding the submittal of the report.
