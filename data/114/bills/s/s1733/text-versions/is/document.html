                                 A BILL


 
     To require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a forest 
   incentives program to keep forests intact and sequester carbon on 
   private forest land of the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Forest Incentives Program Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) public and private forest land in the United States 
        plays a crucial role in sequestering carbon and otherwise 
        contributes to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions;
            (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has reported in the 
        annual greenhouse gas inventory that United States forests and 
        forest products sequester as much as 12 to 14 percent of annual 
        United States carbon emissions, which makes forests one of the 
        largest carbon sinks in the United States;
            (3) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
        carbon sequestration from forests and other land uses has grown 
        by approximately 14 percent since 1990, largely as a result of 
        afforestation and improved forest management;
            (4) the use of forests products, such as wood products, in 
        buildings and biobased products can also reduce carbon 
        emissions when used in place of other, more carbon-intensive 
        products;
            (5)(A) in addition to the significant carbon mitigation 
        benefits of using forests and forest products for carbon 
        sequestration, the economic and societal cobenefits of forest 
        carbon solutions are extraordinarily valuable; and
            (B) incentivizing forest carbon activities, including 
        through working forests, has the potential to provide timber 
        and other forest commodities, improve air quality, enhance 
        watershed function and water supply, create and sustain fish 
        and wildlife habitat, contribute to scenic and aesthetic 
        qualities, support historical and cultural resources, provide 
        hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities, and increase 
        forest resiliency, while also supporting rural jobs and local 
        economies;
            (6) despite positive recent trends in forest carbon, as 
        documented by the annual greenhouse gas inventory of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency, projections of the Forest 
        Service indicate those forest carbon and other benefits are at 
        risk in future decades due to development pressures and other 
        factors;
            (7) while the majority of the productive forest land of the 
        United States is under private ownership, private landowners 
        are facing increased pressure to convert their forest land to 
        other uses;
            (8) while some landowners are able to participate in 
        various carbon markets, the transaction costs and restrictions 
        of those programs are often prohibitive for private landowners, 
        particularly smallholders; and
            (9) creating incentives for private forest landowners to 
        adopt best practices to maintain and increase carbon benefits 
        from forest land through a streamlined program that avoids 
        excessive transaction costs will help ``keep forests as 
        forests'' and enhance forest carbon benefits by providing 
        incentive payments for a suite of eligible practices throughout 
        the lifecycle of forest management, including forest products 
        that provide long-term carbon storage benefits.
