                                 A BILL


 
    To establish a process for the consideration of temporary duty 
          suspensions and reductions, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Manufacturing 
Competitiveness Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS TARIFF BILL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes duties 
        on imported goods for which there is no domestic availability 
        or insufficient domestic availability.
            (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates 
        artificial distortions in the economy of the United States that 
        negatively affect United States manufacturers and consumers.
            (3) It is in the interests of the United States to update 
        the Harmonized Tariff Schedule every 3 years to eliminate such 
        artificial distortions by suspending or reducing duties on such 
        goods.
            (4) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States 
        around the world will be enhanced if Congress regularly and 
        predictably updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend 
        or reduce duties on such goods.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to remove 
the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and 
consumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to 
promote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress 
should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days 
after the United States International Trade Commission and the 
Department of Commerce issue reports on proposed duty suspensions and 
reductions under this Act.

SEC. 3. PROCESS FOR CONSIDERATION OF DUTY SUSPENSIONS AND REDUCTIONS.

    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to establish a 
process by the appropriate congressional committees, in conjunction 
with the Commission pursuant to its authorities under section 332 of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332), for the submission and 
consideration of proposed duty suspensions and reductions.
    (b) Establishment.--Not later than October 15, 2015, and October 
15, 2018, the appropriate congressional committees shall establish and, 
on the same day, publish on their respective publicly available 
Internet websites a process--
            (1) to provide for the submission and consideration of 
        legislation containing proposed duty suspensions and reductions 
        in a manner that, to the maximum extent practicable, is 
        consistent with the requirements described in subsection (c); 
        and
            (2) to include in a miscellaneous tariff bill those duty 
        suspensions and reductions that meet the requirements of this 
        Act.
    (c) Requirements of Commission.--
            (1) Initiation.--Not later than October 15, 2015, and

        Commission a notice requesting members of the public to submit
