    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) Congress should pursue a process of comprehensive tax 
        reform;
            (2) Congress should endeavor, as part of such tax reform 
        process, to eliminate temporary provisions from the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 by making permanent those provisions that 
        merit permanency and allowing others to expire; and
            (3) a major focus of such tax reform process should be 
        fostering economic growth and lowering tax rates by broadening 
        the tax base.
