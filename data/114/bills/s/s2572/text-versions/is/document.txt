                                 A BILL


 
To make demonstration grants to eligible local educational agencies or 
  consortia of eligible local educational agencies for the purpose of 
 increasing the numbers of school nurses in public elementary schools 
                         and secondary schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nurses for Under-Resourced Schools 
Everywhere Act'' or the ``NURSE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Association of School Nurses identifies 
        schools as primary locations to address student health issues, 
        since a school nurse is the health care provider that many 
        students see on the most regular basis.
            (2) The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the 
        crucial role of school nurses in the seamless provision of 
        comprehensive health services to children and youth, as well as 
        in the development of a coordinated school health program.
            (3) The school nurse functions as a leader and the 
        coordinator of the school health services team, facilitating 
        access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic 
        achievement.
            (4) School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention 
        to improve health outcomes for our Nation's children. In 
        addition, school nurses perform early intervention services 
        such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental 
        problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning.
            (5) The American Federation of Teachers has called for a 
        nurse in every school, as nurses are front-line workers that 
        address an array of health needs and their presence in a school 
        can help to improve student learning.
            (6) National data indicate only 45 percent of public 
        schools have a school nurse all day, every day, while another 
        30 percent of schools have a school nurse who only works part-
        time in one or more schools.
            (7) The National Association of School Nurses has reported 
        that medication administration to students is one of the most 
        common health-related activities performed in school. As more 
        chronically ill and medically unstable children enter the 
        school system each year, the medical factors that promote and 
        support their academic success increase, including the need for 
        medications that enhance overall health or stabilize chronic 
        conditions.
            (8) Statistics from the National Center for Education 
        Statistics indicate that 15 to 18 percent of the 52,000,000 
        students who currently spend their day in school have a chronic 
        health condition.
            (9) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 
        students today face increased social and emotional issues, 
        which enhance the need for preventive services and 
        interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School 
        nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental 
        health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time 
        providing mental health services, including universal and 
        targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning 
        signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis 
        planning.
            (10) In 2013, the Bureau of the Census reported 7.6 percent 
        of children under the age of 19, which equals 78,000,000 
        children under the age of 19, were without health insurance. 
        Data show that uninsured children achieve lower educational 
        outcomes than those with health coverage. Children who cannot 
        afford to see a medical provider miss more days of school, 
        experience increased severity of illness, and suffer from 
        disparities in health.
            (11) More than 1,600,000 children experience homelessness 
        each year in the United States. Homeless children develop 
        increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the 
        stress of their living situation can negatively affect their 
        development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have 
        become the primary access to health care for many children and 
        adolescents. School nurses serve on the front lines as a safety 
        net for the Nation's most vulnerable children.
            (12) Communicable and infectious diseases account for 
        millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrate that 
        when students have access to a registered nurse in school, 
        immunization rates increase.
            (13) A 2011 study showed that a school nurse in the 
        building saves principals, teachers, and clerical staff a 
        considerable amount of time that they would have spent 
        addressing health concerns of students, including saving 
        principals almost an hour a day, saving teachers almost 20 
        minutes a day, and saving clerical staff more than 45 minutes a 
        day. This would amount to a savings of about 13 hours per day 
        in the aggregate for such school personnel.
