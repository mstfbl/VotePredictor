                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title II of the Social Security Act to credit individuals 
 serving as caregivers of dependent relatives with deemed wages for up 
                     to five years of such service.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Caregiver Credit Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) Caregiving is an essential element of family life and a 
        vital service for children, the ill, the disabled, and the 
        elderly.
            (2) The establishment of a caregiver credit would bolster 
        the economic prospects of unpaid caregivers and would provide 
        them with vital retirement security.
            (3) The 2015 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the 
        Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability 
        Insurance Trust Funds concluded that the combined Trust Funds 
        will be able to pay scheduled benefits in full until 2034.
            (4) While there is no immediate crisis, policy options 
        should be considered to extend OASDI solvency, including by 
        eradicating the gender wage gap, increasing overall employment, 
        or increasing the minimum wage.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that the United 
States Congress must address the unfair exclusion of professional and 
hardworking home care providers who are not eligible to receive Social 
Security or Medicare because they provide paid care to a family member 
with a disability under programs operated at the State and local level 
for general health and welfare protection.

SEC. 3. DEEMED WAGES FOR CAREGIVERS OF DEPENDENT RELATIVES.

    (a) In General.--Title II of the Social Security Act is amended by 
adding after section 234 (42 U.S.C. 434) the following new section:
