distribution in commerce, and uses of, and exposures to, asbestos.
    ``(b) Exposure Elimination.--
            ``(1) In general.--As soon as practicable, but not later 
        than 18 months after the date of enactment of the Alan 
        Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act of 2016, the Administrator shall

        conditions, including prohibitions on the manufacture, 
        processing, use, distribution in commerce, and disposal of 
        asbestos and mixtures and articles containing asbestos, that 
        the Administrator determines to be necessary to eliminate human 
        or environmental exposure to asbestos.
            ``(2) Selection of conditions.--In imposing prohibitions 
        and other conditions under paragraph (1), the Administrator 
        shall select requirements that permanently eliminate the

        granted by the President under subsection (d), beginning on the 
        date that is 1 year after the date on which the Administrator 
        issues the rule described in subsection (b)(1), no person shall 
        manufacture, process, use, distribute in commerce, or dispose 
        of any form of asbestos or any mixture or article containing 
        any form of asbestos for any use or under any condition other 
        than a use or condition described in that rule.
            ``(2) Effective date.--In any rule issued under this title, 
        the Administrator shall specify the date on which any 
        prohibition, restriction, or other condition shall take effect, 
        and that date shall be as soon as practicable, but not later 
        than 1 year, after the date of promulgation of the rule.

                the national security interests of the United States;
                    ``(B) no reasonable alternative to the asbestos use 
                exists for the intended purpose; and
                    ``(C) the use of asbestos will not result in an 
                unreasonable risk to health or the environment (without 
                consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors), 
                including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed 
                or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by 
                the Administrator under the conditions of use.
            ``(2) Terms and conditions.--An exemption under paragraph 
        (1) shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the 
        President may prescribe.

                under paragraph (1) shall not exceed a period of 3 
                years.
                    ``(B) Additional exemption.--The President may 
                grant an additional exemption under paragraph (1), for 
                a period of not to exceed 3 years, by making a new 
                determination under that paragraph.''.
