                                 A BILL


 
 To reduce the risks associated with genetically altered salmon in the 
                 United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Salmon Risk 
Reduction Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) minimize the risk that genetically engineered salmon 
        will be introduced into the marine environment off the coasts 
        of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California; and
            (2) ensure that consumers in the United States can make 
        informed decisions when purchasing salmon.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.

    (a) Labeling Requirement.--Section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(z) If it contains genetically engineered salmon unless the food 
bears a label stating that fact.''.
    (b) Requirement for Environmental Impact Statement.--Section 512 
(21 U.S.C. 360b) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(q)(1) Prior to the approval of any application filed under this 
section for genetically engineered salmon intended for human 
consumption, the Secretary, in consultation with the Under Secretary 
for Oceans and Atmosphere of the Department of Commerce, shall prepare 
an environmental impact statement (focused on the coast of the United 
States from California to Alaska) in accordance with section 102(2)(C) 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that includes--
                    ``(A) an environmental risk analysis that assesses 
                the potential direct and indirect impacts from 
                escapement of covered fish on wild and cultured fish 
                stocks and environments that may be exposed to such 
                covered fish;
                    ``(B) a failure mode and effects analysis that 
                quantitatively assesses the best- and worst-case 
                probabilities of failure of each applicable confinement 
                technique;
                    ``(C) an assessment of the costs of control or 
                eradication of escaped covered fish; and
                    ``(D) an assessment of the potential economic 
                damage in terms of loss of production and sales to 
                relevant wild and cultured fish stocks and environments 
                from the escapement of covered fish.
            ``(2) In this subsection, the term ``covered fish'' means a 
        salmon or other anadromous or marine fish, live or dead, 
        including the gametes, fertilized eggs, offspring, and 
        descendants thereof, that is modified or produced using DNA 
        from an organism's own genome or that of another species, which 
        overcome natural physiological reproductive barriers and which 
        are not techniques used in traditional breeding and 
        selection.''.
                                 <all>
