                                 A BILL


 
  To support evidence-based social and emotional learning programming.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jesse Lewis Empowering Educators 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) To succeed in school, students need to be engaged. They 
        need to know how to maintain focus and effort in the face of 
        setbacks, work effectively with others, and be good 
        communicators and problem-solvers.
            (2) Social and emotional skills form a foundation for young 
        people's success not just in school, but as healthy and caring 
        adults, productive workers, and engaged citizens.
            (3) Not only can these skills be taught, they can be taught 
        in schools of every type to students of every background by 
        regular classroom teachers who receive adequate training on 
        methods for developing their own social and emotional learning 
        skills and integrating social and emotional learning into the 
        standard curriculum.
            (4) Academic outcomes resulting from social and emotional 
        learning include greater motivation to learn and commitment to 
        school, increased time devoted to schoolwork and mastery of 
        subject matter, and improved attendance, graduation rates, 
        grades, and test scores.
            (5) These positive outcomes increase in students who are 
        involved in social and emotional learning programming by an 
        average of 11 percentile points over students who are not 
        involved in such programming.
            (6) Social and emotional learning programming also results 
        in reduced problem behavior, improved health outcomes, a lower 
        rate of violent delinquency, and a lower rate of heavy alcohol 
        use.
