                                 A BILL


 
  To prevent governmental discrimination against providers of health 
 services who decline involvement in abortion, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Conscience Protection Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Thomas Jefferson stated a conviction common to our 
        Nation's founders when he declared in 1809 that ``[n]o 
        provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man than 
        that which protects the rights of conscience against the 
        enterprises of the civil authority''.
            (2) In 1973, the Supreme Court concluded that the 
        government must leave the abortion decision ``to the medical 
        judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician'', 
        recognizing that a physician may choose not to participate in 
        abortion. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 164 (1973). The Court 
        cited with approval a policy that ``neither physician, 
        hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform 
        any act violative of personally-held moral principles'', 410 
        U.S. at 143 n. 38, and cited State laws upholding this 
        principle. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 197-8 (1973).
            (3) Congress' enactments to protect this right of 
        conscience in health care include the Church amendment of 1973 
        (42 U.S.C. 300a-7), the Coats/Snowe amendment of 1996 (42 
        U.S.C. 238n), and the Hyde/Weldon amendment approved by 
        Congresses and Presidents of both parties every year since 
        2004.
            (4) None of these laws explicitly provides a ``private 
        right of action'' so victims of discrimination can defend their 
        conscience rights in court, and administrative enforcement by 
        the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil 
        Rights has been lax, at times allowing cases to languish for 
        years without resolution.
            (5) Defying the Federal Hyde/Weldon amendment, California's 
        Department of Managed Health Care has mandated coverage for all 
        elective abortions in all health plans under its jurisdiction. 
        Other States such as New York and Washington have taken or 
        considered similar action, and some States may go further to 
        require all physicians and hospitals to provide or facilitate 
        abortions.
            (6) Members of Congress have repeatedly questioned U.S. 
        Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell about 
        California's ongoing violation which began in August 2014. The 
        Department of Health and Human Services has acknowledged 
        California's violations and indicated that the Department was 
        taking them ``seriously'' and that the matter would be resolved 
        ``expeditiously''. Despite numerous complaints and calls for 
        prompt enforcement of the Hyde/Weldon amendment in California, 
        however, the Department has failed to resolve the matter.
            (7) The vast majority of medical professionals do not 
        perform abortions, with 86 percent of ob/gyns unwilling to 
        provide them in a recent study (Obstetrics & Gynecology, Sept. 
        2011) and the great majority of hospitals choosing to do so in 
        rare cases or not at all. Therefore, a policy requiring all 
        health care providers to be involved in abortion could 
        seriously disrupt the health care system, reducing the number 
        and diversity of providers available to serve the basic health 
        needs of American women and men.
            (8) A health care provider's decision not to participate in 
        an abortion, like Congress' decision not to fund most 
        abortions, erects no new barrier to those seeking to perform or 
        undergo abortions but leaves each party free to act as he or 
        she wishes.
            (9) Such protection poses no conflict with other Federal 
        laws, such as the law requiring emergency stabilizing treatment 
        for a pregnant woman and her unborn child when either is in 
        distress (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act). As 
        the Obama administration has said, these areas of law have 
        operated side by side for many years and both should be fully 
        enforced (76 Fed. Reg. 9968-77 (2011) at 9973).
            (10) Reaffirming longstanding Federal policy on conscience 
        rights and providing a right of action in cases where it is 
        violated allows longstanding and widely supported Federal laws 
        to work as intended.

SEC. 3. GOVERNMENTAL DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PROVIDERS OF HEALTH 
              SERVICES THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED IN ABORTION.
