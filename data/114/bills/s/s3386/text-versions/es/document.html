 To amend title 36, United States Code, to designate May 1 as ``Silver

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Silver Star Service Banner Day 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress has always honored the sacrifices made by the 
        wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces.
            (2) The Silver Star Service Banner has come to represent 
        the members of the Armed Forces and veterans who were wounded 
        or became ill in combat in the wars fought by the United 
        States.
            (3) The Silver Star Families of America was formed to help 
        the people of the United States remember the sacrifices made by 
        the wounded and ill members of the Armed Forces by designing 
        and manufacturing Silver Star Service Banners and Silver Star 
        Flags for that purpose.
            (4) The sole mission of the Silver Star Families of America 
        is to evoke memories of the sacrifices of members of the Armed 
        Forces and veterans on behalf of the United States through the 
        presence of a Silver Star Service Banner in a window or a 
        Silver Star Flag flying.
            (5) The sacrifices of members of the Armed Forces and 
        veterans on behalf of the United States should never be 
        forgotten.
            (6) May 1 is an appropriate date to designate as ``Silver 
        Star Service Banner Day''.
