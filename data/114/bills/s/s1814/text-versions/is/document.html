            (1) to violate section 642 of the Illegal Immigration 
        Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 
        1373); or
            (2) to fail to comply with a detainer that has been 
        lawfully issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 
        accordance with section 236 and 287 of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) and section 287.7 of 
        title 8, Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Ineligibility for Grants.--
            (1) In general.--Any State or political subdivision of a 
        State that violates subsection (a) shall not be eligible to 
        receive funds from the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program 
        under section 241(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1231(i)).
            (2) Chronic offenders.--Any State or political subdivision 
        of a State that does not come into compliance with the 
        requirements under subsection (a) within 180 days of receiving 
        notification from the Secretary of Homeland Security of its 
        noncompliance with that subsection is not eligible to receive a 
        grant under the Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program 
        established pursuant to subpart I of part E of title I of the 
        Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
        3750 et seq.).
            (3) Enforcement.--No funding may be withheld pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) until the Secretary of Homeland Security--
                    (A) has notified the noncompliant State or 
                subdivision of its noncompliance with subsection (a); 
                and
                    (B) has determined, not later than 60 days after 
                such notification, that compliance cannot be secured by 
                voluntary means.
    (c) Reports.--Not later than 5 days after deciding to terminate a 
grant or to refuse to award a grant pursuant to this section, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a written report to the 
Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives that fully describes the 
circumstances and grounds for such action. No such action shall become

accordance with sections 236 and 287 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) and section 287.7 of title 8, Code of 
Federal Regulations, solely because the State or political subdivision 
is holding an alien in compliance with such detainer.
    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
to require law enforcement officials of a State or a political
