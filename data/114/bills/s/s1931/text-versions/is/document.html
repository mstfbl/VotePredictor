SECTION 1. RATIFICATION OF EXISTING TRUST LAND.

    (a) In General.--Any land taken into trust by the United States 
prior to the date of enactment of this Act for an Indian tribe that was 
federally recognized on the date the land was taken into trust is 
reaffirmed as trust land, and any action of the Secretary of the 
Interior in acquiring and taking into trust land under the Act of June 
18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (25 
U.S.C. 461 et seq.), is ratified and confirmed as fully and to all 
intents and purposes as if the action had, by prior Act of Congress, 
been specifically authorized and directed.
    (b) Indian Country.--Any land taken into trust that has been 
ratified and confirmed by this Act shall remain Indian country in 
accordance with section 1151 of title 18, United States Code.
    (c) Additional Land.--Nothing in this Act alters or diminishes the 
right of any federally recognized Indian tribe or the authority of the 
Secretary of the Interior with respect to taking additional land into 
trust for the benefit of the Indian tribe.
    (d) Application.--This Act shall apply to all claims, including 
claims challenging the validity of title or the effectiveness of any 
action of the Secretary of the Interior acquiring and taking into trust 
land, that are--
            (1) pending on the date of enactment of this Act; or
            (2) filed on or after that date.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
