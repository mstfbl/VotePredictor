SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Construction 
Consensus Procurement Improvement Act of 2015''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Congressional findings.
Sec. 3. Design-build construction process improvement.
Sec. 4. Prohibition on the use of a reverse auction for the award of a

Sec. 6. SBA surety bond guarantee program.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The acquisition procedures that are often used 
        effectively to procure products and other forms of services are 
        not always appropriate for procurement of design and 
        construction services.
            (2) Federal procurement officials often adopt contracting 
        techniques from the private sector and have used those 
        techniques effectively to procure products and services.
            (3) Design-build is a procurement technique Federal 
        officials have adopted from the private sector that has worked 
        well for procurement of design and construction services.
            (4) The current statutory framework for design-build could 
        benefit from legislative refinement.
            (5) Reverse auctions are another procurement technique 
        Federal officials have adopted from the private sector and used 
        successfully to award contracts for the purchase of products 
        that are commercially equivalent to commodities.
            (6) Despite their success in other contexts, reverse 
        auctions are generally inappropriate for procurement of design 
        and construction services, given the unique nature of each such 
        project.
            (7) To ensure payment protection for contractors, 
        subcontractors, and suppliers working on Federal construction 
        projects, bonds backed by individual sureties must be placed in 
        the care and custody of the Federal Government and be supported 
        by assets that are real, sufficient, verifiable, and readily 
        convertible into cash.
