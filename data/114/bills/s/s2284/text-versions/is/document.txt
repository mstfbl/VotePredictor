                date of receipt of the certification described in

                joint resolution and the joint resolution shall be

                sixth day after Congress receives the certification 
                described in subsection (a), to move to proceed to 
                consider the joint resolution in the House. All points 
                of order against the motion are waived. Such a motion 
                shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a 
                motion to proceed on the joint resolution. The previous 
                question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
                to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion 
                shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote

                intervening motion except two hours of debate equally 
                divided and controlled by the proponent and an 
                opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of 
                the joint resolution shall not be in order.
            (4) Fast track consideration in senate.--
                    (A) Reconvening.--Upon receipt of a certification 
                described in subsection (a), if the Senate has 
                adjourned or recessed for more than 2 days, the 
                majority leader of the Senate, after consultation with 
                the minority leader of the Senate, shall notify the 
                Members of the Senate that, pursuant to this 
                subsection, the Senate shall convene not later than the

                            (i) In general.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII 
                        of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in 
                        order at any time during the period beginning 
                        on the 4th day after the date on which Congress 
                        receives a certification described in 
                        subsection (a) and ending on the 6th day after 
                        the date on which Congress receives a 
                        certification described in subsection (a) (even 
                        though a previous motion to the same effect has 
                        been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
                        consideration of the joint resolution, and all 
                        points of order against the joint resolution 
                        (and against consideration of the joint 
                        resolution) are waived. The motion to proceed 
                        is not debatable. The motion is not subject to 
                        a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider 
                        the vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
                        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion 
                        to proceed to the consideration of the 
                        resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution 
                        shall remain the unfinished business until 
                        disposed of.
                    (D) Debate.--Debate on the joint resolution, and on 
                all debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, 
                which shall be divided equally between the majority and 
                minority leaders or their designees. A motion further 
                to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An 
                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
                motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in 
                order.
                    (E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall 
                occur immediately following the conclusion of the 
                debate on a joint resolution, and a single quorum call 
                at the conclusion of the debate if requested in 
                accordance with the rules of the Senate.
                    (F) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may 
                be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution 
                shall be decided without debate.
            (5) Rules relating to senate and house of 
        representatives.--
                    (A) Coordination with action by other house.--If, 
                before the passage by one House of a joint resolution 
                of that House, that House receives from the other House 
                a joint resolution, then the following procedures shall 
                apply:
                            (i) The joint resolution of the other House 
                        shall not be referred to a committee.
                            (ii) With respect to a joint resolution of 
                        the House receiving the resolution--
                                    (I) the procedure in that House 
                                shall be the same as if no joint 
                                resolution had been received from the 
                                other House; but
                                    (II) the vote on passage shall be 
                                on the joint resolution of the other 
                                House.
                    (B) Treatment of joint resolution of other house.--
                If one House fails to introduce or consider a joint 
                resolution under this subsection, the joint resolution 
                of the other House shall be entitled to expedited floor 
                procedures under this subsection.
                    (C) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following 
                passage of the joint resolution in the Senate, the 
                Senate then receives the companion measure from the 
                House of Representatives, the companion measure shall 
                not be debatable.
                    (D) Veto debate and duration.--If the President 
                vetoes the joint resolution, debate on a veto message 
                in the Senate under this subsection shall be 1 hour 
                equally divided between the majority and minority 
                leaders or their designees.
            (6) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This 
        paragraph and paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) are enacted by 
        Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the 
                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a 
                joint resolution, and it supersedes other rules only to 
                the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
                case of any other rule of that House.
                                 <all>
