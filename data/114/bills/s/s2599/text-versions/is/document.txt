                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising of hotel room rates, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Hotel Advertising Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As of the day before the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, hotel rooms are often advertised at a rate and later in 
        the buying process mandatory fees are disclosed that were not 
        included in the advertised room rate.
            (2) The mandatory fees described in paragraph (1) are 
        sometimes called by names such as ``resort fees'' or ``facility 
        fees'' and they are all mandatory and charged by the hotel in 
        addition to advertised room rates.
            (3) The number of hotels that charged a mandatory resort 
        fees is growing as of the day before the date of the enactment 
        of this Act.
            (4) Advertising that does not reflect the true mandatory 
        cost of a hotel stay is deceptive.
            (5) The Federal Trade Commission has authority under 
        section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to 
        regulate and prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in 
        or affecting commerce.
            (6) In 2012, the Federal Trade Commission exercised its 
        authority under section 5 to issue warning letters to 22 hotel 
        operators. In that letter, the Commission cautioned hotel 
        operators that mandatory resort fees could confuse consumers in 
        violation of section 5(a)(2) of the Federal Trade Commission 
        Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(2)).

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING OF HOTEL ROOM 
              RATES.

    (a) Prohibition.--No person with respect to whom the Federal Trade 
Commission is empowered under section 5(a)(2) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(2)) may advertise in interstate 
commerce a rate for a hotel room that does not include all required 
fees other than taxes and fees imposed by a government.
    (b) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        subsection (a) by a person subject to such subsection shall be 
        treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or 
        deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) 
        of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).
            (2) Powers of commission.--
                    (A) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall 
                enforce this section in the same manner, by the same 
                means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and 
                duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of 
                the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) 
                were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.
                    (B) Privileges and immunities.--Any person who 
                violates this section shall be subject to the penalties 
                and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided 
                in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et 
                seq.).
                    (C) Rulemaking.--
                            (i) In general.--The Commission may 
                        promulgate such rules as the Commission 
                        considers appropriate to enforce this section.
                            (ii) Procedures.--The Commission shall 
                        carry out any rulemaking under clause (i) in

        (a) in a practice that violates such subsection, the attorney 
        general of the State may, as parens patriae, bring a civil

                        action under paragraph (1) before initiating
