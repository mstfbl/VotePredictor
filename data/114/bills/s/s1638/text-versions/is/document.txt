enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in coordination with the 
Administrator, shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress 
information on the implementation of the enhanced plan for the 
Department headquarters consolidation project within the National

included in the budget of the President for fiscal year 2016 (as 
submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States 
Code), that includes the following:
            (1) A proposed occupancy plan for the consolidation project 
        that includes specific information about which Department-wide 
        operations, component operations, and support offices will be 
        located at the site, the aggregate number of full time 
        equivalent employees projected to occupy the site, the seat-to-
        staff ratio at the site, and schedule estimates for migrating 
        operations to the site.
            (2) A comprehensive assessment of the difference between 
        the current real property and facilities needed by the 
        Department in the National Capital Region in order to carry out 
        the mission of the Department and the future needs of the 
        Department.
            (3) A current plan for construction of the headquarters 
        consolidation at the St. Elizabeths campus that includes--
                    (A) the estimated costs and schedule for the 
                current plan, which shall conform to relevant Federal 
                guidance for cost and schedule estimates, consistent 
                with the recommendation of the Government 
                Accountability Office in the September 2014 report 
                entitled ``Federal Real Property: DHS and GSA Need to 
                Strengthen the Management of DHS Headquarters 
                Consolidation'' (GAO-14-648); and
                    (B) any estimated cost savings associated with 
                reducing the scope of the consolidation project and 
                increasing the use of existing capacity developed under 
                the project.
            (4) A current plan for the leased portfolio of the 
        Department in the National Capital Region that includes--
                    (A) an end-state vision that identifies which 
                Department-wide operations, component operations, and 
                support offices do not migrate to the St. Elizabeths 
                campus and continue to operate at a property in the 
                leased portfolio;
                    (B) for each year until the consolidation project 
                is completed, the number of full-time equivalent 
                employees who are expected to operate at each property, 
                component, or office;
                    (C) the anticipated total rentable square feet 
                leased per year during the period beginning on the date 
                of enactment of this Act and ending on the date on 
                which the consolidation project is completed; and
                    (D) timing and anticipated lease terms for leased 
                space under the plan referred to in paragraph (3).
            (5) An analysis that identifies the costs and benefits of 
        leasing and construction alternatives for the remainder of the 
        consolidation project that includes--
                    (A) a comparison of the long-term cost that would 
                result from leasing as compared to consolidating 
                functions on Government-owned space; and
                    (B) the identification of any cost impacts in terms 
                of premiums for short-term lease extensions or 
                holdovers due to the uncertainty of funding for, or 
                delays in, completing construction required for the 
                consolidation.
    (b) Comptroller General Review.--
