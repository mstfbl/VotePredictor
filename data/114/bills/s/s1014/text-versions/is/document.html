        a qualitatively and quantitatively set composition.
            ``(2) Cosmetic product.--The term `cosmetic product' means

        a cosmetic product. Such term does not include--
                    ``(A) beauty shops and salons that do not otherwise

        means--
                    ``(A) the brand owner who is the domestic or

        reasonable certainty among competent scientists that the

        conditions of use or customary or usual use, or that a non-
        functional constituent is not harmful under the recommended or 
        suggested tolerance levels or the level at which it is 
        customarily or usually present. The Food and Drug 
        Administration may not consider an ingredient or non-functional 
        constituent harmful solely because it can cause minor adverse 
        health reactions, such as minor transient allergic reactions or 
        minor transient skin irritations, in some users.
            ``(2) Factors.--In assessing the safety of an ingredient or 
        non-functional constituent, the Food and Drug Administration 
        shall consider, among other relevant factors, the following:
                    ``(A) The probable human exposure to the ingredient 
                or non-functional constituent from expected use in 
                cosmetics.

                in humans of relevant exposure to the ingredient or 
                non-functional constituent or to any chemically or 
                pharmacologically related substances from use in 
                cosmetics or other products with similar routes of 
                exposure under recommended or suggested conditions of 
                use or their customary use, to the extent adequate data 
                is available for analysis. In appropriate cases, the 
                Food and Drug Administration may consider available 
                information on the total exposure to an ingredient or 
                non-functional constituent from all sources.

provide the responsible party subject to an order under subsection (b) 
with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held as soon as 
possible, but not later than 2 days after the issuance of the order, on 
the actions required by the order and on why the cosmetic that is the 
subject of the order should not be recalled.

the following:

``SEC. 617. PREEMPTION.

    ``(a) Registration, Good Manufacturing Practices, Recalls, Adverse 
Event Reporting.--Except for a State requirement that is in full effect 
and implemented on the date of enactment of the Personal Care Products 
Safety Act, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish 
or continue in effect any requirement for cosmetics with respect to 
registration, good manufacturing practices, mandatory recalls, or 
adverse event reporting.
    ``(b) Safety of Cosmetic Ingredients and Non-Functional 
Constituents.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except for a State requirement that is 
        more restrictive than a final order issued under section 
        608(d)(3) and that is in full effect and implemented on the 
        date of enactment of the Personal Care Products Safety Act, no 
        State or political subdivision of a State may establish or 
        continue in effect any requirement with respect to the safety 
        of a cosmetic ingredient or non-functional constituent that is 
        the subject of a final order under section 608(d)(3) that is 
        different from, or in addition to, a final order issued under 
        section 608(d)(3).
            ``(2) Delayed effect of new state requirements.--From the 
        date that the Food and Drug Administration has made public the 
        final selection of a cosmetic ingredient or non-functional 
        constituent to be reviewed in the coming year under section 
        608(a)(3)(B), and opened the public comment period under 
        section 608(a)(2), until the date that is one year after the 
        Food and Drug Administration has made public such selection, no 
        State or political subdivision of a State may establish any new 
        requirement related to such cosmetic ingredient or non-
        functional constituent.
            ``(3) Scope.--This subsection shall not be construed to 
        modify or affect the authority of a State or political 
        subdivision of a State with respect to such safety requirements 
        unrelated to the scope of the safety assessment under section 
        608.
            ``(4) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        a State or political subdivision that regulates the safety of 
        cosmetics with respect to the health of humans beyond the scope 
        of section 608 should utilize the safety assessment criteria 
        described in section 608(h).
    ``(c) State Requirement That Is in Full Effect and Implemented.--
For purposes of this section:
            ``(1) State requirement.--A State requirement includes a 
        State requirement that is adopted by a State public initiative 
        or referendum.
            ``(2) Full effect and implemented.--The term `full effect 
        and implemented' includes requirements of States that are 
        implemented after the date of enactment of the Personal Care 
        Products Safety Act, if such requirements are under a law that 
        was in effect, or a lawful program that was established and 
        functioning, prior to the date of enactment of the Personal 
        Care Products Safety Act.
    ``(d) Rule of Construction Regarding Product Liability.--
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no provision of this 
chapter relating to a cosmetic shall be construed to modify or 
otherwise affect any action or the liability of any person under State 
or Federal common law.
    ``(e) Limitation.--The Personal Care Products Safety Act, including 
the amendments made by such Act, shall not be construed to preempt any 
State statute, public initiative, referendum, or common law, except as 
expressly provided in this section.''.
