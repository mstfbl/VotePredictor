    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this Act 
as the ``Secretary'')--
            (1) shall collaborate with the heads of other Federal 
        agencies to improve the conceptual development of energy 
        security; and
            (2) may consult with allies and key trading partners of the 
        United States with respect to energy security issues resulting 
        from changes in the energy marketplace.
    (b) Considerations.--At a minimum, the Secretary shall ensure that, 
as part of the collaboration required under subsection (a)(1), the 
following are considered:
            (1) The development of flexible, transparent, and 
        competitive energy markets, including natural gas and oil 
        markets;
            (2) The diversification of energy fuels, sources, and 
        routes; and
            (3) The encouragement of indigenous sources of energy 
        supply.

SEC. 3. SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE.

    The Secretary shall lead an interagency effort to improve and

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Energy Information

collaborate with the appropriate officials in Canada and Mexico, as

        data through reconciliation of data on energy trade flows among 
        the United States, Canada, and Mexico;
            (2) the extension of energy mapping capabilities in the 
        United States, Canada, and Mexico; and

Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives 
regarding--
            (1) the extent to which energy data is being shared under 
        subsection (a); and
            (2) whether forward-looking projections for regional energy 
        flows are improving in accuracy as a result of the energy data 
        sharing under that subsection.
