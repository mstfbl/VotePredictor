        land-based missile fields using alternative helicopters, or 
        making a change in security posture, until the acquisition 
        process for a helicopter to replace the UH-1N helicopter has 
        concluded;
            (2) not later than 5 days after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, submit to Congress a report on the decision 
        relating to a request for forces required by paragraph (1); and
