                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Export Administration Act of 1979 to include in the 
 prohibitions on boycotts against allies of the United States boycotts 
fostered by international governmental organizations against Israel and 
    to direct the Export-Import Bank of the United States to oppose 
            boycotts against Israel, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Israel Against Economic 
Discrimination Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United Nations Human Rights Council (in this 
        section referred to as the ``UNHRC'') has long targeted Israel 
        with systematic, politically motivated, assaults on its 
        legitimacy designed to stigmatize and isolate Israel 
        internationally.
            (2) The UNHRC maintains a permanent agenda item known as 
        ``Item 7'' to ensure that Israel will be criticized at every 
        gathering of the UNHRC.
            (3) At its 31st session on March 24, 2016, the UNHRC 
        targeted Israel with a commercial boycott, calling for the 
        establishment of a database, such as a ``blacklist'', of 
        companies that operate, or have business relations with 
        entities that operate, beyond Israel's 1949 Armistice lines, 
        including East Jerusalem.
            (4) For a half century, Congress has combated anti-Israel 
        boycotts and other discriminatory activity under the Export 
        Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) (as 
        continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic 
        Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)), under part VI of title X 
        of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-455; 90 Stat. 
        1649) (commonly referred to as the ``Ribicoff Amendment''), in 
        free trade agreements with Bahrain and Oman, and in Saudi 
        Arabia's accession negotiations to the World Trade 
        Organization.
            (5) The recent action of the UNHRC is reminiscent of the 
        Arab League Boycott, which also called for the establishment of 
        a ``blacklist'' and promoted a primary, as well as a secondary 
        and tertiary, boycott against Israel, targeting United States 
        and other companies that trade or invest with or in Israel, and 
        designed to harm Israel, any business operating in, or doing 
        business, with Israel, or companies that do business with 
        companies operating in Israel.
            (6) Congress recently passed anti-boycott, divestment, and 
        sanctions measures in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade 
        Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (title I of Public 
        Law 114-26; 19 U.S.C. 4201 et seq.) and section 909 of the 
        Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (19 U.S.C. 
        4452), which establish, among other things--
                    (A) the opposition of the United States to boycott, 
                divestment, and sanctions activity targeting Israel;
                    (B) requirements that the United States utilize 
                trade negotiations to combat state-led or international 
                governmental organization-led boycott, divestment, and 
                sanctions activity targeting Israel; and
                    (C) reporting requirements regarding the actions of 
                foreign countries or international organizations that 
                establish barriers to trade or investment for United 
                States companies in or with Israel.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    Congress--
            (1) opposes the United Nations Human Rights Council 
        resolution of March 24, 2016, which urges countries to pressure 
        companies subject to their jurisdiction to divest from, or 
        break contracts with, Israel, and calls for the creation of a 
        ``blacklist'' of companies that either operate, or have 
        business relations with entities that operate, beyond Israel's 
        1949 Armistice lines, including East Jerusalem; and
            (2) views such policies as a boycott of, divestment from, 
        and sanctions against Israel.

SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    This Act is intended to address and counter only acts of boycotts, 
divestment, and sanctions against Israel. Nothing in this Act shall be 
construed to alter the established policy of the United States 
concerning final status issues associated with the Arab-Israel 
conflict, including border delineation that can only be resolved 
through direct negotiations between the parties.

        organizations that are politically motivated and are intended
