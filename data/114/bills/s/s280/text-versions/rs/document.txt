        cooperating agencies and at the discretion of the lead agency, 
        the preferred alternative for a project, after being 
        identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than 
        other alternatives to facilitate the development of mitigation 
        measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if 
        the lead agency determines that the development of the higher 
        level of detail will not prevent--
                    (A) the lead agency from making an impartial 
                decision as to whether to accept another alternative 
                that is being considered in the environmental review; 
                and
                    (B) the public from commenting on the preferred and 
                other alternatives.

        period of not less than 45 days and not more than 60 days after 
        the date on which a notice announcing availability of the 
        environmental impact statement is published in the Federal 
        Register, unless--
                    (A) the lead agency, the project sponsor, and any 
                cooperating agency agree to a longer deadline; or
                    (B) the lead agency extends the deadline for good 
                cause.
            (2) Other review and comment periods.--For all other review

        Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), the lead agency 
        shall establish a comment period of not more than 45 days after 
        the date on which the materials on which comment is requested 
        are made available, unless--
                    (A) the lead agency, the project sponsor, and any 
                cooperating agency agree to a longer deadline; or
                    (B) the lead agency extends the deadline for good

        required for the project under applicable law or result in the 
        denial of any approval under applicable law.
            (2) Lead agency responsibilities.--
                    (A) In general.--The lead agency shall make 
                information available to each cooperating and 
                participating agency and project sponsor as early as

        and
            (2) not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of

SEC. 8. LITIGATION, JUDICIAL REVIEW, AND SAVINGS PROVISION.

    (a) Limitations on Claims.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, a claim arising under Federal law seeking judicial review 
        of any authorization issued by a Federal agency for a covered 
        project shall be barred unless--
                    (A) the action is filed not later than 2 years 
                after the date of publication in the Federal Register 
                of the final record of decision or approval or denial 
                of a permit, unless a shorter time is specified in the 
                Federal law under which judicial review is allowed; and
                    (B) in the case of an action pertaining to an 
                environmental review conducted under NEPA--
                            (i) the action is filed by a party that 
                        submitted a comment during the environmental 
                        review or a party that lacked a reasonable 
                        opportunity to submit a comment; and
                            (ii) a party filed a sufficiently detailed 
                        comment so as to put the lead agency on notice 
                        of the issue on which the party seeks judicial 
                        review.
            (2) New information.--
                    (A) In general.--The head of a lead agency or 
                participating agency shall consider new information 
                received after the close of a comment period if the 
                information satisfies the requirements under 
                regulations implementing NEPA.
                    (B) Separate action.--If Federal law requires the 
                preparation of a supplemental environmental impact 
                statement or other supplemental environmental document, 
                the preparation of such document shall be considered a 
                separate final agency action and the deadline for 
                filing a claim for judicial review of the agency action 
                shall be 2 years after the date on which a notice 
                announcing the final agency action is published in the 
                Federal Register, unless a shorter time is specified in 
                the Federal law under which judicial review is allowed.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        creates a right to judicial review or places any limit on 
        filing a claim that a person has violated the terms of an 
        authorization.
    (b) Preliminary Injunctive Relief.--In addition to considering any 
other applicable equitable factors, in any action seeking a temporary 
restraining order or preliminary injunction against an agency or a 
project sponsor in connection with review or authorization of a covered 
project, the court shall--
            (1) consider the effects on public health, safety, and the 
        environment, the potential for significant job losses, and 
        other economic harm resulting from an order or injunction; and
            (2) not presume that the harms described in paragraph (1) 
        are reparable.
    (c) Judicial Review.--Except as provided in subsection (a), nothing 
in this Act affects the reviewability of any final Federal agency 
action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (d) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this Act--
            (1) supersedes, amends, or modifies any Federal statute or 
        affects the responsibility of any Federal officer to comply 
        with or enforce any statute; or
            (2) creates a presumption that a covered project will be 
        approved or favorably reviewed by any agency.

interferes with--
            (1) any practice of seeking, considering, or responding to 
        public comment; or
            (2) any power, jurisdiction, responsibility, or authority 
        that a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, 
        metropolitan planning organization, Indian tribe, or project 
        sponsor has with respect to carrying out a project or any other 
        provisions of law applicable to any project, plan, or program.

(a) shall--
            (1) be developed in consultation with affected project 
        proponents, industries, and other stakeholders;
            (2) exclude parties for which the fee would impose an undue 
        financial burden or is otherwise determined to be 
        inappropriate; and
            (3) be established in a manner that ensures that the 
        aggregate amount of fees collected for a fiscal year is 
        estimated not to exceed 20 percent of the total estimated costs 
        for the fiscal year for the resources allocated for the conduct 
        of the environmental reviews and authorizations covered by this 
        Act, as determined by the Director of the Office of Management

        ``Fund'').
            (2) Availability.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available 
        to the Executive Director, without appropriation or fiscal year 
        limitation, solely for the purposes of administering, 
        implementing, and enforcing this Act, including the expenses of 
        the Council.
            (3) Transfer.--The Executive Director, with the approval of 
        the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may 
        transfer amounts in the Fund to other agencies to facilitate

        for proposed covered projects.
    (e) Effect on Permitting.--The regulations adopted pursuant to 
subsection (a) shall ensure that the use of funds accepted under

to environmental reviews or authorizations, either substantively or 
procedurally.
    (f) Transfer of Appropriated Funds.--The heads of agencies listed 
in section 3(b)(2)(B) shall have the authority to transfer funds 
appropriated to those agencies and not otherwise obligated for the 
development of infrastructure projects, or the environmental review and 
authorization of infrastructure projects, among affected Federal
