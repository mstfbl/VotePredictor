_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
          To enhance airport security, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Airport Security 
Enhancement and Oversight Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) A number of recent airport security breaches 
        in the United States have involved the use of Secure 
        Identification Display Area (referred to in this section as 
        ``SIDA'') badges, the credentials used by airport and airline 
        workers to access the secure areas of an airport.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at 
        Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged 
        with using his SIDA badge to bypass airport security 
        checkpoints and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling 
        operation over a number of months via commercial 
        aircraft.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation 
        Safety Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used 
        his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and 
        transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation 
        found that over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
        International Airport were lost or missing.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, 
        Transportation Security Administration (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Administration'') contractors were indicted 
        for participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed 
        through the secure area of the San Francisco International 
        Airport.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) The Administration has indicated that it does 
        not maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead 
        relies on airport operators to track airport worker 
        credentials.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement 
        authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain 
        threshold of missing SIDA badges.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory 
        Committee issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport 
        access control.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Homeland Security reported that the 
        Administration did not have all relevant information regarding 
        73 airport workers who had records in United States 
        intelligence-related databases because the Administration was 
        not authorized to receive all terrorism-related information 
        under current interagency watchlisting policy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) The Inspector General also found that the 
        Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to 
        reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment 
        investigations, including criminal history record checks and 
        work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight 
        over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to 
        perform criminal history and work authorization checks for 
        airport workers.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) There is growing concern about the potential 
        insider threat at airports in light of recent terrorist 
        activities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) increased fines and advanced oversight 
                for airport operators that report missing more than 5 
                percent of credentials for unescorted access to any 
                SIDA of an airport;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) best practices for Category X airport 
                operators that report missing more than 3 percent of 
                credentials for unescorted access to any SIDA of an 
                airport;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) additional audits and status checks

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) increased fines and direct enforcement 
                requirements for both airport workers and their 
                employers that fail to report within 24 hours an 
                employment termination or a missing credential for 
                unescorted access to any SIDA of an airport;

        for that crime and released from incarceration within 5 years 
        before the date of the individual's application.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Certifications.--The Administrator shall 
        require an airport or aircraft operator, as applicable, to 
        certify for each individual who receives unescorted access to

after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in 
consultation with the ASAC, shall develop a model and best practices 
for unescorted access security that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Airport Security Enhancement and 
Oversight Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the 
        United States have involved the use of Secure Identification 
        Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') badges, 
        the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access 
        the secure areas of an airport.
            (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield-
        Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using 
        his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and 
        facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number 
        of months via commercial aircraft.
            (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety 
        Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his SIDA 
        badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a 
        firearm in his carry-on luggage.
            (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that 
        over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
        International Airport were lost or missing.
            (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation 
        Security Administration (referred to in this section as the 
        ``Administration'') contractors were indicted for participating 
        in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed through the 
        secure area of the San Francisco International Airport.
            (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not 
        maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead 
        relies on airport operators to track airport worker 
        credentials.
            (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement 
        authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain 
        threshold of missing SIDA badges.
            (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee 
        issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access 
        control.
            (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department 
        of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not 
        have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who 
        had records in United States intelligence-related databases 
        because the Administration was not authorized to receive all 
        terrorism-related information under current interagency 
        watchlisting policy.
            (10) The Inspector General also found that the 
        Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to 
        reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment 
        investigations, including criminal history record checks and 
        work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight 
        over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to 
        perform criminal history and work authorization checks for 
        airport workers.
            (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider 
        threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities.

                    (E) increased fines and direct enforcement 
                requirements for both airport workers and their 
                employers that fail to report within 24 hours an 
                employment termination or a missing credential for 
                unescorted access to any SIDA of an airport; and
                    (F) a method for termination by the employer of any 
                airport worker that fails to report in a timely manner 
                missing credentials for unescorted access to any SIDA 
                of an airport.
    (b) Temporary Credentials.--The Administrator may encourage the 
issuance by airport and aircraft operators of free one-time, 24-hour
