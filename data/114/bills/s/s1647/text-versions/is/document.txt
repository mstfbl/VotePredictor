                    (C) not be transferable.
    (c) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers 
                continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- 
                and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
                federally assisted surface transportation markets 
                across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.

        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under title I of this Act and 
        section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if the individual 
        or entity is prevented, in whole or in part, from complying 
        with paragraph (2) because a Federal court issues a final order 
        in which the court finds that a requirement or the 
        implementation of paragraph (2) is unconstitutional.

            (2) Exception.--Obligation authority made available under

                    (A) remain available for a period of 4 fiscal 
                years; and

                imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and 
                highway safety construction programs for future fiscal 
                years.

            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        distribution of obligation authority under subsection (c) for

        for the program under section 202 of title 23, United States 
        Code) that--
                    (A) are authorized to be appropriated for the 
                fiscal year for Federal-aid highway programs; and
                    (B) the Secretary determines will not be allocated 
                to the States (or will not be apportioned to the States 
                under section 204 of title 23, United States Code), and 
                will not be available for obligation, for the fiscal 
                year because of the imposition of any obligation 
                limitation for the fiscal year.
            (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 
        in the same proportion as the distribution of obligation

        paragraph (1) shall be available for any purpose described in

engineering costs incurred by a recipient or subrecipient under 
subsection (b)--
            (1) if the costs meet all applicable requirements under

        project other than the reimbursement of preliminary engineering 
        costs incurred prior to an authorization to proceed in 
        accordance with this section; or
            (3) guarantees Federal funding of the project or the

SEC. 2003. FUTURE INTERSTATE STUDY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) a well-developed system of transportation 
        infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, health, 
        and welfare of the people of the United States;
            (2) the 47,000-mile national Interstate System is the 
        backbone to that transportation infrastructure system; and
            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act--
                    (A) many segments of the approximately 60-year-old 
                Interstate System are well beyond the 50-year design 
                life of the System and yet these aging facilities are 
                central to the transportation infrastructure system, 
                carrying 25 percent of the vehicle traffic of the 
                United States on just 1 percent of the total public 
                roadway mileage;
                    (B) the need for ongoing maintenance, preservation, 
                and reconstruction of the Interstate System has grown 
                due to increasing and changing travel demands; and
                    (C) simple maintenance of the current condition and 
                configuration of the Interstate System is insufficient 
                for the System to fully serve the transportation needs 
                of the United States for the next 50 years.
    (b) Future Interstate System Study.--Not later than 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into an 
agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National 
Academies to conduct a study on the actions needed to upgrade and 
restore the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and 
Defense Highways to its role as a premier system network that meets the 
growing and shifting demands of the 21st century and for the next 50 
years (referred to in this section as the ``study'').
    (c) Methodologies.--In conducting the study, the Transportation 
Research Board shall build on the methodologies examined and 
recommended in the report prepared for the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials entitled ``National 
Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 20-24(79): Specifications 
for a National Study of the Future 3R, 4R, and Capacity Needs of the 
Interstate System'' and dated December 2013.
    (d) Recommendations.--The study--
            (1) shall include specific recommendations regarding the 
        features, standards, capacity needs, application of 
        technologies, and intergovernmental roles to upgrade the 
        Interstate System, including any revisions to law (including 
        regulations) that the Transportation Research Board determines 
        appropriate to achieve the goals; and
            (2) is encouraged to build on the robust institutional 
        knowledge in the highway industry in applying the techniques 
        involved in implementing the study.
    (e) Considerations.--In carrying out the study, the Transportation 
Research Board shall determine the need for reconstruction and 
improvement of the Interstate System by considering--
            (1) future demands on transportation infrastructure 
        determined for national planning purposes, including commercial 
        and private traffic flows to serve future economic activity and 
        growth;
            (2) the expected condition of the current Interstate System 
        over the next 50 years, including long-term deterioration and 
        reconstruction needs;
            (3) those National Highway System routes that should be 
        added to the existing Interstate System to more efficiently 
        serve national traffic flows;
            (4) features that would take advantage of technological 
        capabilities to address modern standards of construction, 
        maintenance, and operations, for purposes of safety, and system 
        management, taking into further consideration system 
        performance and cost; and
            (5) the resources necessary to maintain and improve the 
        Interstate System, including the resources required to upgrade 
        those National Highway System routes identified in paragraph 
        (3) to Interstate standards.
    (f) Consultation.--In carrying out the study, the Transportation 
Research Board--
            (1) shall convene and consult with a panel of national 
        experts including current and future owners, operators, and 
        users of the Interstate System and private sector stakeholders; 
        and
            (2) is encouraged to consult with--
                    (A) the Federal Highway Administration;
