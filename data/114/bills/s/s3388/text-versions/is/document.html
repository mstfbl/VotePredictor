or an event that does not trigger a major disaster declaration, have

                under paragraph (1) not later than 1 year after the 
                date of enactment of this section.

major disaster, a State has in effect an individual assistance program 
that meets the criteria published under subsection (b), the President 
may increase to 100 percent, with respect to the major disaster, the 
maximum percentage described in section 408(g)(2)(A).''.

SEC. 3. COMMUNITY SHELTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Title III of the McKinney-Vento Homeless

SEC. 5. EMERGENCY WATERSHED PROTECTION PROGRAM WILDFIRE PILOT.

        recovery challenges due to the unpredictable size, location, 
        and duration of wildfires; and
            (2)(A) disproportionately impact rural areas; and
            (B) inflict long-term damage on the agricultural systems 
        rural areas economically rely on.
