    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Salmon 
Labeling Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) ensure that consumers in the United States can make 
        informed decisions when purchasing salmon; and
            (2) authorize an independent scientific review of--
                    (A) the possible effects of genetically engineered 
                salmon on wild salmon stocks; and
                    (B) the Food and Drug Administration's approval of 
                genetically engineered salmon for human consumption.

SEC. 3. MARKET NAME FOR GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SALMON.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for 
purposes of applying the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the acceptable market name of any salmon that is 
genetically engineered shall include the words ``Genetically 
Engineered'' or ``GE'' prior to the existing acceptable market name.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, salmon is 
genetically engineered if it has been modified by recombinant DNA 
(rDNA) techniques, including the entire lineage of salmon that contain 
the rDNA modification.

SEC. 4. THIRD-PARTY REVIEW OF CERTAIN SALMON APPROVAL.

    (a) Review.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
ensure that an independent scientific organization conducts a review of 
and submits a report on the environmental assessment that was carried 
out by the Food and Drug Administration in support of an approval of a 
new animal drug application related to AquAdvantage Salmon, dated 
November 12, 2015. In arranging for the review, the Secretary shall 
ensure that the independent scientific organization will conduct its 
own assessment of the environmental impacts of approving the 
application, taking into account the impact of AquAdvantage Salmon on 
wild stocks of salmon and related wild ecosystems.
    (b) Second Environmental Assessment.--On receipt of the report 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall require the Food and Drug 
Administration to conduct a second environmental assessment with 
respect to approval of the application described in subsection (a). The 
Administration shall take into account the findings in the report in 
conducting the second environmental assessment.
