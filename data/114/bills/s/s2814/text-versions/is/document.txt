    ``(2) An additional option, the TRICARE-for-Life option, is

        in areas in which a facility of the uniformed services (other 
        than a facility limited to members of the armed forces) is 
        located the TRICARE Select Option, to provide reduced cost-
        sharing amounts for enrolled beneficiaries whose care is 
        provided by or managed by a designated primary care manager and 
        network providers. TRICARE Select is the managed care option.

                member beneficiary category (as described in paragraph

                eligible to enroll in the Managed Care Option in 
                selected locations to the extent a facility of the 
                uniformed services in the location has, in the judgment 
                of the Secretary, a significant number of uniformed 
                health care providers, including specialty providers, 
                and sufficient capability to support efficient 
                operation of the TRICARE Select Option in the area for 
                the projected enrollees.
                    ``(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), a 
                beneficiary under sections 1076d, 1076e, 1078a, or 
                1086(d)(2) is not eligible to enroll in TRICARE Select.
            ``(3) Referral required.--A TRICARE Select Option enrollee 
        shall, subject to such regulations as the Secretary of Defense 
        may establish, be required to obtain care or a referral for 
        care from a designated primary care manager (or other care 
        coordinator) prior to obtaining care under the TRICARE program. 
        In the case of an unexcused failure to obtain such referral, 
        the cost-sharing requirement for such care (referred to as 
        point-of-service charges) shall be equal to the amount that is 
        50 percent of the allowed charge for such care.
    ``(d) TRICARE Choice Option.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish 
        in all areas a TRICARE Choice Option under which eligible 
        beneficiaries will generally not have restrictions on their 
        freedom of choice of health care providers. TRICARE Choice is a 
        self-managed option.
            ``(2) Eligibility.--A beneficiary in the active duty family 
        member beneficiary category or the retired beneficiary category 
        is eligible to enroll in the TRICARE Choice Option.
    ``(e) Cost-Sharing Requirements Under the TRICARE Select Option and 
the TRICARE Choice Option.--This subsection establishes cost-sharing 
requirements under the TRICARE Select Option and the TRICARE Choice 
Option.
            ``(1) Enrollment fee.--Both options have an annual 
        enrollment fee as a pre-condition for benefits under that 
        option.
            ``(2) Deductible amount.--Neither option has a deductible 
        for health care services received from network providers. Both 
        options have a deductible amount for health care services 
        received from non-network providers. The deductible amount 
        refers to the initial cost incurred by an individual or family 
        unit during a calendar year for services provided by a non-
        network provider before costs may be paid under the plan 
        option.
            ``(3) Copayments.--Under both options, copayments are 
        generally required for services provided outside of facilities 
        of the uniformed services and generally not required for 
        services inside such facilities.
            ``(4) Catastrophic cap.--Under both options, there is an 
        annual limitation on the amount of cost sharing that a family 
        may be required to pay. Upon reaching the applicable limit, 
        certain further cost-sharing requirements are waived. 
        Enrollment fees and point-of-service charges do not count 
        against the catastrophic cap.
    ``(f) Cost-Sharing Amounts.--
            ``(1) Amounts in calendar year 2018.--Beneficiaries (other 
        than active duty members) enrolled in the TRICARE Select Option 
        and the TRICARE Choice Option shall be subject to cost-sharing 
        requirements in accordance with the amounts and percentages 
        under the following table during calendar year 2018 and as such

include penalties or any assessment permitted under 2752(a) of this 
title greater than the amount of the claim determined by the 
responsible official to violate such section.
    ``(d) Procedures for Resolving Claims.--(1) Upon receiving approval 
under subsection (b) to initiate an action under this section, the 
responsible official shall mail, by registered or certified mail, or

person alleged to be liable under section 2752 of this title. Such 
notice shall specify the allegations of liability against such person, 
specify the total amount of penalties and assessments sought by the 
United States, advise the person of the opportunity to submit facts and 
arguments in opposition to the allegations set forth in the notice, 
advise the person of the opportunity to submit offers of settlement or

        writing, or through a representative, facts and arguments in 
        opposition to the allegations set forth in the notice, 
        including any additional information that raises a genuine 
        dispute of material fact.
            ``(3) If the respondent fails to respond within 30 days, or 
        any additional time granted by the responsible official, the 
        responsible official may issue a written decision disposing of 
        the matters raised in the notice. Such decision shall be based 
        on the record before the responsible official. If the 
        responsible official concludes that the respondent is liable 
        under section 2752 of this title, the decision shall include 
        the findings of fact and conclusions of law which the 
        responsible official relied upon in determining that the 
        respondent is liable, and the amount of any penalty or 
        assessment or both the responsible official has determined to 
        be imposed on the respondent. Any such determination shall be 
        based on a preponderance of the evidence. The responsible 
        official shall promptly send to the respondent a copy of the 
        decision by registered or certified mail, or other similar 
        commercial means, or shall hand deliver a copy of the decision.

        response to the first notice, and the responsible official 
        determines that the respondent has not raised any genuine 
        dispute of material fact, the responsible official may issue a 
        written decision disposing of the matters raised in the notice. 
        Such decision shall be based on the record before the 
        responsible official. If the responsible official concludes 
        that the respondent is liable under section 2752 of this title, 
        the decision shall include the findings of fact and conclusions 
        of law which the responsible official relied upon in 
        determining that the respondent is liable, and the amount of 
        any penalty or assessment the responsible official has 
        determined to be imposed on the respondent. Any such 
        determination shall be based on a preponderance of the 
        evidence. The responsible official shall promptly send to the 
        respondent a copy of the decision by registered or certified 
        mail, or other similar commercial means, or shall hand deliver 
        a copy of the decision.
            ``(5) If the respondent makes a timely submission in 
        response to the first notice, and the responsible official 
        determines that the respondent has raised a genuine dispute of 
        material fact, the responsible official shall commence a 
        hearing to resolve the genuinely disputed material facts by 
        mailing by registered or certified mail, or other similar 
        commercial means, or by hand delivery of, a notice informing 
        the respondent of--

        compromise or settle an action at any time. Any compromise or 
        settlement must be in writing.

              COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS.

    (a) Jurisdiction.--Paragraph (1) of section 1491(b) of title 28, 
United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``Both the'' and all 
        that follows through ``shall have'' and inserting ``The United 
        States Court of Federal Claims shall have''; and
            (2) in the second sentence--

                through ``shall have'' and inserting ``The United 
                States Court of Federal Claims shall have''; and
                    (B) by striking ``is awarded.'' and inserting ``is 
                awarded, but such jurisdiction is subject to time 
                limits as follows:
                    ``(A) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in 
                a solicitation that are apparent before bid opening or 
                the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be 
                filed before bid opening or the time set for receipt of 
                initial proposals. In the case of a procurement where 
                proposals are requested, alleged improprieties that do 
                not exist in the initial solicitation but that are 
                subsequently incorporated into the solicitation shall 
                be protested not later than the next closing time for 
                receipt of proposals following the incorporation. A 
                protest that meets these time limitations that was 
                previously filed with the Comptroller General may not 
                be reviewed.
                    ``(B) A protest other than one covered by 
                subparagraph (A) shall be filed not later than 10 days 
                after the basis of the protest is known or should have 
                been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception 
                of a protest challenging a procurement conducted on the 
                basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing 
                is requested and, when requested, is required. In such 
                a case, with respect to any protest the basis of which 
                is known or should have been known either before or as 
                a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall 
                not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the 
                protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days 
                after the date on which the debriefing is held.
                    ``(C) If a timely agency-level protest was 
                previously filed, any subsequent protest to the United 
                States Court of Federal Claims that is filed within 10 
                days of actual or constructive knowledge of initial 
                adverse agency action shall be considered, if the 
                agency-level protest was filed in accordance with 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B), unless the contracting 
                agency imposes a more stringent time for filing the 
                protest, in which case the agency's time for filing 
                shall control. In a case where an alleged impropriety 
                in a solicitation is timely protested to a contracting 
                agency, any subsequent protest to the United States 
                Court of Federal Claims shall be considered timely if 
                filed within the 10-day period provided by this 
                subparagraph, even if filed after bid opening or the 
                closing time for receipt of proposals.
                    ``(D) A protest untimely on its face shall be 
                dismissed. A protester shall include in its protest all 
                information establishing the timeliness of the protest; 
                a protester shall not be permitted to introduce for the 
                first time in a motion for reconsideration information 
                necessary to establish that the protest was timely. 
                Under no circumstances may the United States Court of 
                Federal Claims consider a protest that is untimely 
                because it was first filed with the Government 
                Accountability Office.''.
    (b) Available Relief.--Paragraph (2) of such section is amended by 
inserting ``monetary relief shall not be available if injunctive relief 
is or has been granted, and'' after ``except that''.
    (c) Agency Decisions Overriding Stay of Contract Award or 
Performance.--Such section is further amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as paragraphs 
        (6) and (7), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new 
        paragraph (5):
            ``(5) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have 
        jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested 
        party challenging an agency's decision to override a stay of 
        contract award or contract performance that would otherwise be 
        required by section 3553 of title 31.''.
    (d) Conforming Amendments.--
            (1) In general.--Section 3556 of title 31, United States 
        Code, is amended--
                    (A) by inserting ``instead of with the Comptroller 
                General'' before the period at the end of the first 
                sentence; and
                    (B) by striking the second sentence.
            (2) Section heading amendment.--The heading of such section 
        is amended by striking ``; matter included in agency record''.
    (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to any cause of action filed 180 days or more after the date of 
the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 811. CLOSEOUT OF OLD CONTRACTS.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of 
the Navy may close out contracts described in subsection (b) through 
the issuance of one or more modifications to existing Department of the 
Navy contracts without completing further reconciliation audits or 
corrective actions other than those described in this section. To 
accomplish close out of such contracts--
            (1) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        in other contract line items within a contract regardless of 
        the year or type of appropriation previously or currently 
        obligated to fund each contract line item and regardless of 
        whether either appropriation has closed; and
            (2) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        on other contracts regardless of the year or type of 
        appropriation previously or currently obligated to fund each 
        contract and regardless of whether either appropriation has 
        closed.
    (b) The contracts covered by this section are contracts to design, 
construct, repair, or support the construction or repair of Navy 
submarines that--
            (1) were entered into between fiscal years 1974 and 1998; 
        and
            (2) have no further supply or services deliverables due 
        under the terms and conditions of the contract;
            (3) The Secretary of the Navy has established the total 
        final contract value for each contract; and
            (4) The Secretary of the Navy has determined the final 
        allowable cost for each contract that may have a negative or 
        positive unliquidated obligation balance for which it would be 
        difficult to determine the year or type of appropriation 
        because--
                    (A) the records have been destroyed or lost; or
                    (B) the records are available but the Contracting 
                Officer in collaboration with the Certifying Official 
                has determined that a discrepancy is of a de minimis 
                value such that the time and effort required to 
                determine the cause of an out-of-balance condition is 
                disproportionate to the amount of the discrepancy.
    (c) The contracts identified in subsection (b) may be closed out--
            (1) upon receipt of $581,803 from the contractor to be 
        deposited into the Treasury as Miscellaneous Receipts and 
        without seeking further amounts from the contractor; or
            (2) without payment to the contractor of any amounts that 
        may be due under any such contracts.
    (d) In any case where this authority is exercised, the cognizant 
payment or accounting offices may adjust and close any open finance and 
accounting records.
    (e) No liability will attach to any accounting, certifying, or 
payment official or contracting officer for any adjustments or close 
out made pursuant to this authority.

SEC. 812. CONTRACT CLOSEOUT AUTHORITY.

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation, the 
Secretary of Defense may close out a contract or group of contracts as 
described in subsection (b) through the issuance of one or more 
modifications to existing Department of Defense contracts without 
completing a reconciliation audit or other corrective action as more 
specifically described in subsection (c) and the regulations 
promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (f). To accomplish 
closeout of such contracts--
            (1) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        in other contract line items within a contract regardless of 
        the year or type of appropriation previously or currently 
        obligated to fund each contract line item and regardless of 
        whether either appropriation has closed; and
            (2) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        on other contracts regardless of the year or type of 
        appropriation previously or currently obligated to fund each 
        contract and regardless of whether either appropriation has 
        closed;
    (b) Contracts covered by this section are contracts or a group of 
contracts between the Department of Defense and a defense contractor 
that--
            (1) were entered into prior to fiscal year 2000;
            (2) have no further supplies or services deliverables due 
        under the terms and conditions of the contract; and
            (3) are determined by the Secretary of Defense to be not 
        otherwise reconcilable because--
                    (A) the records have been destroyed or lost; or
                    (B) the records are available but the Secretary of 
                Defense has determined that the time or effort required 
                to determine the exact amount owed to the government or 
                amount owed to the contractor is disproportionate to 
                the amount at issue.
    (c) Any contract or contracts covered by this section may be closed 
out through a negotiated settlement with the contractor.
    (d) In any case where this authority is exercised, the cognizant 
payment or accounting offices may adjust and close any open finance and 
accounting records.
    (e) No liability will attach to any accounting, certifying, or 
payment official or contracting officer for any adjustments or closeout 
made pursuant to this authority.
    (f) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the 
administration of the authority under this section.

              COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES.

    (a) Optimization Strategy.--Section 2481(c) of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following paragraph:
            ``(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall develop and 
        implement a comprehensive strategy to optimize management 
        practices across the defense commissary system and the exchange 
        system that reduce reliance of those systems on appropriated 
        funding without reducing benefits to the patrons of those 
        systems or the revenue generated by nonappropriated fund 
        entities or instrumentalities of the Department of Defense for 
        the morale, welfare, and recreation of members of the armed 
        forces.
            ``(B) The Secretary shall ensure that savings generated due 
        to such optimization practices are shared by the defense 
        commissary system and the exchange system through contracts or 
        agreements that appropriately reflect the participation of the 
        systems in the development and implementation of such 
        practices.''.
    (b) Authorization To Supplement Appropriations Through Business 
Optimization.--Section 2483(c) of such title is amended by adding at 
the end the following new sentence: ``Such appropriated amounts may 
also be supplemented with additional funds derived from improved 
management practices implemented pursuant to sections 2481(c)(3) and 
2487(c) of this title and the alternative pricing program implemented 
pursuant to section 2484(i) of this title.''.
    (c) Alternative Pricing Pilot Program.--Section 2484 of such title 
is amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(i) Alternative Pricing Program.--(1) The Secretary is authorized 
to establish an alternative pricing program pursuant to which prices 
may be established in response to market conditions and customer 
demand, in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. 
Notwithstanding the amount of the uniform surcharge assessed in 
subsection (d), the Secretary may provide for an alternative surcharge 
of not more than 5 percent of sales proceeds under such alternative 
pricing program to be made available for the purposes specified in 
subsection (h).
    ``(2) Before establishing an alternative pricing program under this 
subsection, the Secretary shall establish the following:
            ``(A) Specific, measurable benchmarks for success in the 
        provision of high quality grocery merchandise, discount savings 
        to patrons, and levels of customer satisfaction while achieving 
        savings for the Department of Defense.
            ``(B) A baseline of overall savings to patrons achieved by 
        commissary stores prior to the initiation of the alternative 
        pricing program, based on a comparison of prices charged by 
        those stores on a regional basis with prices charged by 
        relevant local competitors for a representative market basket 
        of goods.
    ``(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the defense commissary system 
implements the alternative pricing program by conducting price 
comparisons using the methodology established for paragraph (2)(B) and 
adjusting pricing as necessary to ensure that pricing in the 
alternative pricing program achieves overall savings to patrons that 
are reasonably consistent with the baseline savings established for the 
relevant region pursuant to such paragraph.
    ``(j) Conversion to Nonappropriated Fund Entity or 
Instrumentality.--(1) If the Secretary determines that the alternative 
pricing program has met the benchmarks for success established pursuant 
to subsection (i)(2)(A) and the savings requirements established 
pursuant to subsection (i)(3) over a period of at least six months, the 
Secretary may convert the defense commissary system to a 
nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality, with operating expenses 
financed in whole or in part by receipts from the sale of products and 
the sale of services. Upon such conversion, appropriated funds shall be 
transferred to the defense commissary system only in accordance with 
paragraph (2) or section 2491 of this title. The requirements of 
section 2483 shall not apply to the defense commissary system operating 
as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality.
    ``(2) If the Secretary determines that the defense commissary 
system operating as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality is 
likely to incur a loss in any fiscal year as a result of compliance 
with the savings requirement established in subsection (i), the 
Secretary shall authorize a transfer of appropriated funds available 
for such purpose to the commissary system in an amount sufficient to 
offset the anticipated loss. Any funds so transferred shall be 
considered to be nonappropriated funds for such purpose.
    ``(3) The Secretary of Defense may identify positions of employees 
in the defense commissary system who are paid with appropriated funds 
whose status may be converted to the status of an employee of a 
nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality. The status and 
conversion of such employees shall be addressed as provided in section 
2491(c) for employees in morale, welfare, and recreation programs. No 
individual who is an employee of the defense commissary system as of 
the date of the enactment of this subsection shall suffer any loss of 
or decrease in pay as a result of the conversion.''.
    (d) Establishment of Common Business Practices.--Section 2487 of 
such title is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection (c):

(a) and (b), the Secretary of Defense may establish common business 
processes, practices, and systems--
            ``(A) to exploit synergies between the operations of the 
        defense commissary system and the exchange system; and
            ``(B) to optimize the operations of the defense retail 
        systems as a whole and the benefits provided by the 
        commissaries and exchanges.
    ``(2) The Secretary may authorize the defense commissary system and 
the exchange system to enter into contracts or other agreements--
            ``(A) for products and services that are shared by the 
        defense commissary system and the exchange system; and
            ``(B) for the acquisition of supplies, resale goods, and 
        services on behalf of both the defense commissary system and 
        the exchange system.
    ``(3) For the purpose of a contract or agreement authorized under 
paragraph (2), the Secretary may--
            ``(A) use funds appropriated pursuant to section 2483 of 
        this title to reimburse a nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality for the portion of the cost of a contract or 
        agreement entered by the nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality that is attributable to the defense commissary 
        system; and
            ``(B) authorize the defense commissary system to accept 
        reimbursement from a nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality for the portion of the cost of a contract or 
        agreement entered by the defense commissary system that is 
        attributable to the nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality.''.

Section 2481(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new sentence: ``Any reference in this chapter 
to `the exchange system' shall be treated as referring to each separate 
administrative entity within the Department of Defense through which 
the Secretary of Defense has implemented the requirement under this 
subsection for a world-wide system of exchange stores.''.
    (f) Operation of Defense Commissary System as a Nonappropriated 
Fund Entity.--In the event that the defense commissary system is 
converted to a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality as 
authorized by section 2484(j)(1) of title 10, United States Code, as 
added by subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary may--
            (1) provide for the transfer of commissary assets, 
        including inventory and available funds, to the nonappropriated 
        fund entity or instrumentality; and
            (2) ensure that revenues accruing to the defense commissary 
        system are appropriately credited to the nonappropriated fund 
        entity or instrumentality.

            ``(2) Appointment of attorney to represent defendant in

                    ``(A) If in an action covered by this section it 
                appears that the defendant is in military service, the 
                court may not enter a judgment until after the court 
                appoints an attorney to represent the defendant. The 
                court may not appoint an attorney to represent a 
                defendant who is selected by or affiliated with the 
                plaintiff, an attorney representing the plaintiff, or 
                an employee of an entity affiliated with an attorney 
                representing the plaintiff.
                    ``(B) The court-appointed attorney shall act only 
                in the best interests of the defendant. The court-
                appointed attorney, when appropriate to represent the 
                best interests of the defendant, shall request a stay 
                of proceedings under this Act.
                    ``(C) The court-appointed attorney shall use due 
                diligence to locate and contact the defendant. The 
                plaintiff must provide to the court-appointed attorney 
                all contact information it has for the defendant. A 
                court-appointed attorney unable to make contact with 
                the defendant shall report to the court on all of the 
                attorney's efforts to make contact.
                    ``(D) Upon making contact with the defendant, the 
                court-appointed attorney shall advise the defendant of 
                the nature of the lawsuit and the defendant's rights 
                provided by the Act, including rights to obtain a stay 
                and to request the court to adjust an obligation.

                appointed attorney shall assert such rights on behalf 
                of defendant, provided that there is an adequate basis 
                in law and fact, unless the defendant provides informed 
                consent to not assert such rights.
                    ``(E) The court shall require the court-appointed 
                attorney to perform duties faithfully and, upon failure 
                to do so, shall discharge the attorney and appoint 
                another.
                    ``(F) If an attorney appointed under this section 
                to represent a defendant in military service cannot 
                locate the defendant, actions by the attorney in the 
                case shall not waive any defense of the servicemember 
                or otherwise bind the servicemember.
                    ``(G) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed 
                to prohibit a court from assessing court-appointed 
                attorney fees and costs against the plaintiff.''.

        court a copy of such status report.
            ``(6) Duties of court-appointed attorney.--An attorney 
        appointed to represent a defendant under paragraph (2) shall 
        provide to the court--

        availability of information.--If the Department of Defense 
        discontinues the availability of active duty status information 
        through the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center or a 
        successor or other related entity, paragraphs (5) and (6)(A) 
        shall cease to apply until such time as the Department resumes

Inadequate Representation.--Paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of such 
section is amended to read as follows:

              REALIGNMENTS.

    (a) Force-Structure Plan and Infrastructure Inventory.--
            (1) Preparation and submission.--As part of the budget 
        justification documents submitted to Congress in support of the 
        budget for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2019, the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress the following:
                    (A) A force-structure plan for the Armed Forces 
                based on an assessment by the Secretary of the probable 
                threats to the national security during the 20-year 
                period beginning with that fiscal year, the probable 
                end-strength levels and major military force units 
                (including land force divisions, carrier and other 
                major combatant vessels, air wings, and other 
                comparable units) needed to meet these threats, and the 
                anticipated levels of funding that will be available 
                for national defense purposes during such period.
                    (B) A comprehensive inventory of military 
                installations world-wide for each military department, 
                with specifications of the number and type of 
                facilities in the active and reserve forces of each 
                military department.
            (2) Relationship of plan and inventory.--Using the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall prepare (and include as part 
        of the submission of such plan and inventory) the following:
                    (A) A description of the infrastructure necessary 
                to support the force structure described in the force-
                structure plan.
                    (B) A discussion of categories of excess 
                infrastructure and infrastructure capacity.
                    (C) An economic analysis of the effect of the 
                closure or realignment of military installations to 
                reduce excess infrastructure.
            (3) Special considerations.--In determining the level of 
        necessary versus excess infrastructure under paragraph (2), the 
        Secretary shall consider the following:
                    (A) The anticipated continuing need for and 
                availability of military installations outside the 
                United States, taking into account current restrictions 
                on the use of military installations outside the United 
                States and the potential for future prohibitions or 
                restrictions on the use of such military installations.
                    (B) Any efficiencies that may be gained from joint 
                tenancy by more than one branch of the Armed Forces at 
                a military installation.
            (4) Revision.--The Secretary may revise the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory. If the Secretary makes such 
        a revision, the Secretary shall submit the revised plan or 
        inventory to Congress not later than February 15th of the year 
        following the year in which such plan was first submitted. For 
        purposes of selecting military installations for closure or 
        realignment under this title in the year in which a revision is 
        submitted, no revision of the force-structure plan or 
        infrastructure inventory is authorized after that date.
    (b) Certification of Need for Further Closures and Realignments.--
            (1) Certification required.--On the basis of the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        subsection (a) and the descriptions and economic analysis 
        prepared under such subsection, the Secretary shall include as 
        part of the submission of the plan and inventory--
                    (A) a certification regarding whether the need 
                exists for the closure or realignment of additional 
                military installations;
                    (B) if such need exists, a certification that the 
                additional round of closures and realignments would 
                result in annual net savings for each of the military 
                departments beginning not later than six years 
                following the commencement of such closures and 
                realignments; and
                    (C) a certification that the additional round of 
                closures and realignments will have the primary 
                objective of eliminating excess infrastructure capacity 
                within the Department of Defense and reconfiguring the 
                Department's infrastructure to maximize efficiency and 
                reduce costs.
            (2) Effect of failure to certify.--If the Secretary does 
        not include the certifications referred to in paragraph (1), 
        the President may not commence a round for the selection of 
        military installations for closure and realignment under this 
        title in the year following submission of the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory.
    (c) Comptroller General Evaluation.--
            (1) Evaluation required.--If the certification is provided 
        under subsection (b), the Comptroller General shall prepare an 
        evaluation of the following:
                    (A) The force-structure plan and infrastructure 
                inventory prepared under subsection (a) and the final 
                selection criteria specified in paragraph (d), 
                including an evaluation of the accuracy and analytical 
                sufficiency of such plan, inventory, and criteria.
                    (B) The need for the closure or realignment of 
                additional military installations.
            (2) Submission.--The Comptroller General shall submit the 
        evaluation to Congress not later than 60 days after the date on 
        which the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory are 
        submitted to Congress.
    (d) Final Selection Criteria.--
            (1) In general.--The final criteria to be used by the 
        Secretary in making recommendations for the closure or 
        realignment of military installations inside the United States 
        under this title in 2019 shall be the military value and 
        additional criteria specified in paragraphs (2) and (3).
            (2) Military value criteria.--The military value criteria 
        are as follows:
                    (A) The current and future mission capabilities and

        States under this title in 2019 are as follows:
                    (A) The extent and timing of potential costs and 
                savings, including the number of years, beginning with 
                the date of completion of the closure or realignment, 
                for the savings to exceed the costs.
                    (B) The economic impact on existing communities in 
                the vicinity of military installations.
                    (C) The ability of the infrastructure of both the 
                existing and potential receiving communities to support 
                forces, missions, and personnel.
                    (D) The environmental impact, including the impact 
                of costs related to potential environmental 
                restoration, waste management, and environmental 
                compliance activities.
    (e) Priority Given to Military Value.--The Secretary shall give 
priority consideration to the military value criteria specified in 
subsection (d)(2) in the making of recommendations for the closure or 
realignment of military installations.
    (f) Determining Costs.--When determining the costs associated with 
a closure or realignment, the Secretary shall consider the costs 
associated with military construction, information technology, 
termination of public-private contracts, guarantees, the costs of any 
other activity of the Department of Defense or any other Federal agency 
that may be required to assume responsibility for activities at the 
military installations, and such other factors as the Secretary 
determines as contributing to the cost of a closure or realignment.
    (g) Emphasis Given to Savings.--Subject to subsection (e) the 
Secretary shall emphasize those recommendations that yield net savings 
within 5 years of completing such closure or realignment. The Secretary 
shall not consider any recommendation that does not yield net savings

        facilities of the installation after the anticipated closure or 
        realignment.
    (D) In making recommendations to the Commission, the Secretary 
shall consider any notice received from a local government in the

of the closure or realignment of the installation.
    (E) Notwithstanding the requirement in subparagraph (D), the 
Secretary shall make the recommendations referred to in that 
subparagraph based on the force-structure plan, infrastructure 
inventory, and final selection criteria otherwise applicable to such 
recommendations.
    (F) The recommendations shall include a statement of the result of 
the consideration of any notice described in subparagraph (D) that is

        equipment for nonmilitary purposes.
    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the Secretary may not 
transfer items of personal property located at an installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title to another installation, or

            (ii) is uniquely military in character, and is likely to 
        have no civilian use (other than use for its material content 
        or as a source of commonly used components);
            (iii) is not required for the reutilization or 
        redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the 
        Secretary and the redevelopment authority);
            (iv) is stored at the installation for purposes of 
        distribution (including spare parts or stock items); or
            (v)(I) meets known requirements of an authorized program of 
        another Federal department or agency for which expenditures for 
        similar property would be necessary; and
            (II) is the subject of a written request by the head of the 
        department or agency.
    (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (C)(i) and (D), the Secretary may

the Secretary determines that the carrying out of such activity is in 
the national security interest of the United States.
    (4)(A) The Secretary may transfer real property and personal 
property located at a military installation to be closed or realigned

installation for purposes of job generation on the installation.
    (B) The transfer of property located at a military installation 
under subparagraph (A) may be for consideration at or below the 
estimated fair market value or without consideration. The determination 
of such consideration may account for the economic conditions of the 
local affected community and the estimated costs to redevelop the 
property. The Secretary may accept, as consideration, a share of the 
revenues that the redevelopment authority receives from third-party 
buyers or lessees from sales and long-term leases of the conveyed 
property, consideration in kind (including goods and services), real 
property and improvements, or such other consideration as the Secretary 
considers appropriate. The transfer of property located at a military 
installation under subparagraph (A) may be made for consideration below 
the estimated fair market value or without consideration only if the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation--
            (i) agrees that the proceeds from any sale or lease of the 
        property (or any portion thereof) received by the redevelopment 
        authority during at least the first seven years after the date 
        of the initial transfer of property under subparagraph (A) 
        shall be used to support the economic redevelopment of, or 
        related to, the installation; and
            (ii) executes the agreement for transfer of the property 
        and accepts control of the property within a reasonable time 
        after the date of the property disposal record of decision or 
        finding of no significant impact under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the use of proceeds from a 
sale or lease described in such subparagraph to pay for, or offset the 
costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any 
of the following purposes shall be considered a use to support the 
economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation:
            (i) Road construction.
            (ii) Transportation management facilities.
            (iii) Storm and sanitary sewer construction.

        demolition.
            (xi) Landscaping, grading, and other site or public 
        improvements.
            (xii) Planning for or the marketing of the development and 
        reuse of the installation.
    (D) The Secretary may recoup from a redevelopment authority such 
portion of the proceeds from a sale or lease described in subparagraph 
(B) as the Secretary determines appropriate if the redevelopment 
authority does not use the proceeds to support economic redevelopment 
of, or related to, the installation for the period specified in 
subparagraph (B).
    (E)(i) The Secretary may transfer real property at an installation 
approved for closure or realignment under this title (including 
property at an installation approved for realignment which will be 
retained by the Department of Defense or another Federal agency after 
realignment) to the redevelopment authority for the installation if the 
redevelopment authority agrees to lease, directly upon transfer, one or 
more portions of the property transferred under this subparagraph to 
the Secretary or to the head of another department or agency of the 
Federal Government. Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer under 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) A lease under clause (i) shall be for a term of not to exceed 
50 years, but may provide for options for renewal or extension of the 
term by the department or agency concerned.
    (iii) A lease under clause (i) may not require rental payments by 
the United States.
    (iv) A lease under clause (i) shall include a provision specifying 
that if the department or agency concerned ceases requiring the use of 
the leased property before the expiration of the term of the lease, the 
remainder of the lease term may be satisfied by the same or another 
department or agency of the Federal Government using the property for a 
use similar to the use under the lease. Exercise of the authority 
provided by this clause shall be made in consultation with the 
redevelopment authority concerned.
    (v) Notwithstanding clause (iii), if a lease under clause (i) 
involves a substantial portion of the installation, the department or 
agency concerned may obtain facility services for the leased property 
and common area maintenance from the redevelopment authority or the 
redevelopment authority's assignee as a provision of the lease. The 
facility services and common area maintenance shall be provided at a 
rate no higher than the rate charged to non-Federal tenants of the 
transferred property. Facility services and common area maintenance 
covered by the lease shall not include--
            (I) municipal services that a State or local government is 
        required by law to provide to all landowners in its 
        jurisdiction without direct charge; or
            (II) firefighting or security-guard functions.
    (F) The transfer of personal property under subparagraph (A) shall 
not be subject to the provisions of subchapters II and III of chapter 5 
of title 40, United States Code, if the Secretary determines that the 
transfer of such property is necessary for the effective implementation 
of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation at which such 
property is located.
    (G) The provisions of section 120(h) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 
U.S.C. 9620(h)) shall apply to any transfer of real property under this 
paragraph.
    (H) The Secretary may require any additional terms and conditions 
in connection with a transfer under this paragraph as such Secretary 
considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.
    (5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the 
Secretary shall take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary 
to ensure that final determinations under paragraph (1) regarding 
whether another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
identified a use for any portion of a military installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title, or will accept transfer of any 
portion of such installation, are made not later than 6 months after 
the date of approval of closure or realignment of that installation.
    (B) The Secretary may, in consultation with the redevelopment 
authority with respect to an installation, postpone making the final 
determinations referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to the 
installation for such period as the Secretary determines appropriate if 
the Secretary determines that such postponement is in the best 
interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment of 
the installation.
    (C)(i) Before acquiring non-Federal real property as the location 
for a new or replacement Federal facility of any type, the head of the 
Federal agency acquiring the property shall consult with the Secretary 
regarding the feasibility and cost advantages of using Federal property 
or facilities at a military installation closed or realigned or to be 
closed or realigned under this title as the location for the new or 
replacement facility. In considering the availability and suitability 
of a specific military installation, the Secretary and the head of the 
Federal agency involved shall obtain the concurrence of the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation and comply 
with the redevelopment plan for the installation.
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after acquiring non-Federal real 
property as the location for a new or replacement Federal facility, the 
head of the Federal agency acquiring the property shall submit to 
Congress a report containing the results of the consultation under 
clause (i) and the reasons why military installations referred to in 
such clause that are located within the area to be served by the new or 
replacement Federal facility or within a 200-mile radius of the new or 
replacement facility, whichever area is greater, were considered to be 
unsuitable or unavailable for the site of the new or replacement 
facility.
    (6)(A) The disposal of buildings and property located at 
installations approved for closure or realignment under this title 
shall be carried out in accordance with this paragraph.
    (B)(i) Not later than the date on which the Secretary of Defense 
completes the final determinations referred to in paragraph (5)

        for which the Department of Defense has a use, for which 
        another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
        identified a use, or of which another department or agency will 
        accept a transfer;
            (II) take such actions as are necessary to identify any 
        building or property at the installation not identified under 
        subclause (I) that is excess property or surplus property;
            (III) submit to the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development and to the redevelopment authority for the 
        installation (or the chief executive officer of the State in 
        which the installation is located if there is no redevelopment 
        authority for the installation at the completion of the 
        determination described in the stem of this sentence) 
        information on any building or property that is identified 
        under subclause (II); and
            (IV) publish in the Federal Register and in a newspaper of

the buildings or property, or any portion thereof, at the installation 
that are identified under subparagraph (B)(i)(II). A notice of interest 
under this clause shall describe the need of the government, 
representative, or party concerned for the buildings or property 
covered by the notice.
    (ii) The redevelopment authority for an installation shall assist 
the governments, representatives, and parties referred to in clause (i) 
in evaluating buildings and property at the installation for purposes 
of this subparagraph.
    (iii) In providing assistance under clause (ii), a redevelopment 
authority shall--

        vicinity of the installation under subparagraph (B)(i)(IV); and
            (II) in the case of an installation for which a 
        redevelopment authority is not recognized as of such date, not

subparagraph, take into consideration and be receptive to the 
predominant views on the plan of the communities in the vicinity of the 
installation covered by the plan.
    (iii) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may engage in 
negotiations and consultations with a redevelopment authority before or 
during the course of a review under clause (i) with a view toward

        and
            (II) submit the revised plan to the Secretary of Defense 
        and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

determine the eligibility of the applicant and use proposed in the 
request for the public benefit conveyance. The determination of such 
eligibility should be made before submission of the redevelopment plan 
concerned under subparagraph (G).
    (L)(i) If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines

        homeless;
            (III) request that each such representative submit to that 
        Secretary the items described in clause (ii); and
            (IV) based on the actions of that Secretary under

        purpose will assist the homeless.
            (III) Such information as that Secretary requires in order 
        to determine the financial capacity of the representative to

of the homeless, and other interested parties) as part of the proposed 
Federal action for the installation. The Secretary of Defense shall 
incorporate the notification of the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development under clause (iii)(I) as part of the proposed Federal 
action for the installation only to the extent, if any, that the 
Secretary of Defense considers such incorporation to be appropriate and 
consistent with the best and highest use of the installation as a 
whole, taking into consideration the redevelopment plan submitted by 
the redevelopment authority.
    (III) The Secretary of Defense shall dispose of buildings and 
property under subclause (I) in accordance with the record of decision

United States Code, the sponsoring Federal agency shall use the 
eligibility criteria set forth in such section or subchapter II of 
chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code (as the case may be) to 
determine the eligibility of the applicant and use proposed in the 
request for the public benefit conveyance. The determination of such 
eligibility should be made before submission of the redevelopment plan 
concerned under subparagraph (G).
    (M)(i) In the event of the disposal of buildings and property of an 
installation pursuant to subparagraph (K) or (L), the redevelopment 
authority for the installation shall be responsible for the 
implementation of and compliance with agreements under the 
redevelopment plan described in that subparagraph for the installation.
    (ii) If a building or property reverts to a redevelopment authority 
under such an agreement, the redevelopment authority shall take 
appropriate actions to secure, to the maximum extent practicable, the 
utilization of the building or property by other homeless 
representatives to assist the homeless. A redevelopment authority may 
not be required to utilize the building or property to assist the 
homeless.
    (N) The Secretary of Defense may postpone or extend any deadline 
provided for under this paragraph in the case of an installation 
covered by this paragraph for such period as the Secretary considers 
appropriate if the Secretary determines that such postponement is in 
the interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment 
of the installation. The Secretary shall make such determinations in 
consultation with the redevelopment authority concerned and, in the 
case of deadlines provided for under this paragraph with respect to the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
    (O) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``communities in the

eligible for the conveyance of property of the installation under 
section 550 of title 40, United States Code, or sections 47151 through 
47153 of title 49, United States Code, whether or not the parties 
assist the homeless.
    (7)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary may enter into 
agreements (including contracts, cooperative agreements, or other 
arrangements for reimbursement) with local governments for the 
provision of police or security services, fire protection services, 
airfield operation services, or other community services by such 
governments at military installations to be closed under this title, or

relocated.
    (B) In applying the provisions of the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 to the processes referred to in subparagraph (A), the 
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the military departments 
concerned shall not have to consider--
            (i) the need for closing or realigning the military 
        installation which has been recommended for closure or

Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)), the 
Secretary may enter into an agreement to transfer by deed real property 
or facilities referred to in subparagraph (B) with any person who 
agrees to perform all environmental restoration, waste management, and 
environmental compliance activities that are required for the property 
or facilities under Federal and State laws, administrative decisions,

title that are available exclusively for the use, or expression of an 
interest in a use, of a redevelopment authority under subsection 
(b)(6)(F) during the period provided for that use, or expression of 
interest in use, under that subsection. The real property and

            (A) the costs of all environmental restoration, waste 
        management, and environmental compliance activities otherwise 
        to be paid by the Secretary with respect to the property or 
        facilities are equal to or greater than the fair market value 
        of the property or facilities to be transferred, as determined 
        by the Secretary; or
            (B) if such costs are lower than the fair market value of 
        the property or facilities, the recipient of the property or 
        facilities agrees to pay the difference between the fair market 
        value and such costs.
    (3) In the case of property or facilities covered by a 
certification under paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary may pay the 
recipient of such property or facilities an amount equal to the lesser 
of--
            (A) the amount by which the costs incurred by the recipient 
        of such property or facilities for all environmental 
        restoration, waste, management, and environmental compliance

        the fair market value of such property or facilities as 
        specified in such certification; or
            (B) the amount by which the costs (as determined by the 
        Secretary) that would otherwise have been incurred by the 
        Secretary for such restoration, management, and activities with

        value of such property or facilities as so specified.
    (4) As part of an agreement under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
shall disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities will be 
transferred any information of the Secretary regarding the 
environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental 
compliance activities described in paragraph (1) that relate to the 
property or facilities. The Secretary shall provide such information 
before entering into the agreement.
    (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify, alter, 
or amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) or the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).

Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) shall not 
apply to any transfer under this subsection to persons or entities 
described in subsection (a)(2) of such section 330, except in the case
