                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            February 9, 2015

 Ms. Mikulski introduced the following bill; which was read twice and 
  referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to 
  encourage and support parent, family, and community involvement in 
   schools, to provide needed integrated services and comprehensive 
  supports to children for the ultimate goal of assisting students to 
  stay in school, become successful learners, improve their academic 
                  achievement, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Schools Utilizing Comprehensive and 
Community Engagement for Success Act'' or the ``Success Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Research studies consistently show a positive 
        relationship between family engagement and student achievement. 
        This relationship holds across families of all economic, racial 
        and ethnic, and educational backgrounds and for students of all 
        ages.
            (2) Educators recognize, on the basis of social science and 
        common experience, that effective family and community 
        engagement is a critical element in children's academic, 
        social, and emotional development. Poverty, limited English 
        proficiency, and varying cultural expectations are among the 
        biggest barriers to effective family engagement.
            (3) Schools with effective family and community engagement 
        strategies provide bridges between families, community-based 
        organizations, and schools to improve communication, 
        information sharing, services, and comprehensive supports for 
        children and families.
            (4) Educational research suggests that student achievement 
        improves in environments where learning is a community value, 
        and where schools have the ability to address a broad range of 
        needs, both academic and otherwise, for all students, such as 
        in full-service community schools.
            (5) Cross-sector community engagement of businesses, 
        institutions of higher education, philanthropic organizations, 
        school boards, child care organizations, family advocates, 
        neighborhood and service organizations, after-school providers, 
        and community-based organizations, is essential if schools are 
        to ensure that all children meet college and work-ready 
        standards.
            (6) More than 1,000,000 of the students who enter grade 9 
        do not receive a high school diploma 4 years later and 
        approximately 7,000 students drop out of school each day, 
        including a significant percentage of students with the 
        potential of high academic achievement.
            (7) Integrated services and comprehensive supports, such as 
        before school, after school, and summer activities, family 
        engagement, health and mental services, and other services and 
        supports, are necessary components of effective, school-based 
        efforts to dramatically affect dropout prevention rates, 
        increase graduation rates, and improve student achievement. In 
        one national study, 98 percent of students receiving such 
        services and supports stayed in school, 89 percent had fewer 
        suspensions, and 85 percent of such students who were eligible 
        high-school seniors graduated.
            (8) Through the Judith P. Hoyer Centers, or ``Judy 
        Centers'', the State of Maryland has operated an integrated 
        services and comprehensive supports model geared towards young 
        children, and their families, and have seen remarkable 
        increases in school readiness among children who enter 
        kindergarten having attended a Judy Center.

              1965.
