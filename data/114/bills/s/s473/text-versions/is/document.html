SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Too many children still live in poverty. Not all 
        children in need are benefitting from existing quality 
        programs. This compromises their ability to be healthy, to do 
        well in school, and to raise healthy families themselves.
            (2) Poverty is a vicious cycle, but it can be broken.
            (3) Many factors contribute to poverty and poor economic, 
        health, and educational outcomes, including unaffordable 
        housing, an unlivable wage, and unsafe housing and communities. 
        Education and good health are keys for economic and social 
        success.
            (4) Economically, poverty predicts most of the poor 
        educational and health outcomes, while poor health and low 
        educational outcomes tend to predict poverty.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that the 
programs most critical to improving child well-being should be fully 
funded, including--
            (1) the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social 
        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.);
            (2) the State Children's Health Insurance Program 
        established under title XXI of the Social Security Program (42 
        U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.);
            (3) the supplemental nutrition assistance program 
        established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 
        2011 et seq.);
            (4) the special supplemental nutrition program for women, 
        infants, and children established by section 17 of the Child 
        Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786);
            (5) the child and adult care food program established under 
        section 17 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 1766);
            (6) the emergency food assistance program established under 
        the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 7501 et 
        seq.);
            (7) the temporary assistance for needy families program 
        established under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);
            (8) the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting 
        program under section 511 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        711);
            (9) the Early Head Start and Head Start programs under the 
        Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.);
            (10) the Family and Child Education program;
            (11) school-based health centers programs;
            (12) programs under the Child Care and Development Block 
        Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.);
            (13) programs under the Individuals with Disabilities 
        Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);
            (14) programs under title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.);
            (15) school meal programs; and
            (16) housing assistance programs.

                as failing to comply with the requirements of such

        Administration, shall establish a coordinated grant program to 
        award grants to States, territories, and Native American 
        tribes, to enable such States, territories, and tribes to

        services and the resulting impact on the ability of States to 
        provide adequate services to children in foster care; and

        eligibility requirements for purposes of foster care 
        maintenance payments under section 472 of the Social Security 
        Act in a manner that is budget neutral, or at a limited cost to
