To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to ensure the continued 
 access of Medicare beneficiaries to diagnostic imaging services, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Diagnostic Imaging Services Access 
Protection Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Significant reimbursement cuts to the Medicare 
        physician fee schedule should be based on detailed empirical 
        analysis data.
            (2) On multiple occasions since 2011, Congress has 
        requested the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to 
        provide the data used to establish its 2012 multiple procedure 
        payment reduction to the professional component of imaging 
        services.
            (3) CMS never provided the requested data to Congress.
            (4) Enactment of section 220(i) of Public Law 113-93 on 
        April 1, 2014, mandates the disclosure of CMS data used to 
        determine its 2012 multiple procedure payment reduction to the 
        professional component of imaging services.
            (5) CMS acknowledged its responsibility to disclose this 
        data in the Calendar Year 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule 
        Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) released on July 11, 
        2014, as well as in a letter from the Administrator on August 
        18, 2014.
            (6) To date, CMS has not complied with the statutory 
        mandate provided for in section 220(i) of Public Law 113-93.

SEC. 3. MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR IMAGING SERVICES.
