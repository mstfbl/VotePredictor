                                 A BILL


 
  To designate the Gulf of Mexico Alliance as a Regional Coordination 
Partnership of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gulf States Protection and 
Restoration Coordination Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS, SENSE OF CONGRESS, AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Gulf of Mexico is a valuable resource of national 
        and international importance, continuously serving the people 
        of the United States and other countries as an important source 
        of food, economic productivity, recreation, beauty, and 
        enjoyment.
            (2) Over many years, the resource productivity and water 
        quality of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed have been 
        diminished by point and nonpoint source pollution, increasing 
        population demands, economic development, and natural and man-
        made hazard events.
            (3) The protection of the Gulf of Mexico regional ecosystem 
        has been traditionally underserved and overlooked compared to 
        other great water bodies of the United States, even though the 
        region accounts for 17 percent of United States gross domestic 
        product and would rank as the 7th largest economy in the world.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should seek to attain coordination of the protection and 
restoration efforts of the Gulf of Mexico in order to reduce 
duplication of efforts and maximize efficiencies through a 
collaborative regional effort by the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, in 
consultation with Federal agencies and State and local authorities.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To expand and strengthen cooperative voluntary efforts 
        to protect and restore the Gulf of Mexico.
            (2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, management, 
        and restoration activities in the Gulf of Mexico and its 
        watershed.
            (3) To commit the United States to a comprehensive 
        cooperative program to achieve improved water quality in, and 
        improvements in the productivity of living resources of, the 
        Gulf of Mexico.
            (4) To establish a Gulf of Mexico Alliance to coordinate 
        Federal and State authorities with other voluntary efforts for 
        the collaborative management of the large marine ecosystem, 
        thereby reducing duplication of efforts and maximizing 
        opportunities to leverage restoration support in the Gulf of 
        Mexico region.
