limitation on amendments or debate in either the Senate or the House of 
Representatives (other than under rule XXII of the Standing Rules of

        that country pay adequate wages and maintain sustainable

        subtitle B of title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
        1673 et seq.) shall be modified as provided under subsection 
        (b).
    (b) Adjustment of Normal Value To Include the Cost of Paying

        (a)(1)(B) of section 773 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
        1677b) for purposes of determining the normal value of the 
        covered merchandise under that section, the administering 
        authority shall increase the price by the difference, if any, 
        between--
                    (A) the actual cost of producing the covered 
                merchandise; and
                    (B) the estimated cost of producing the covered 
                merchandise if the producer paid its employees adequate 
                wages and maintained sustainable production methods.
            (2) Demonstration of injury.--An interested party described 
        in subparagraph (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) of section 771(9) of

        1673a(b)(1)) with respect to covered merchandise that relies on 
        calculations of normal value made under this subsection shall 
        be presumed to demonstrate that the party is materially injured 
        or threatened with material injury by reason of imports of the

                is exported is covered by a precertification issued 
                under paragraph (3)(A)(ii); or
                    (B) the estimated cost of producing the covered 
                merchandise under paragraph (1)(B) is equal to or 
                greater than the cost of producing the merchandise in 
                the country in which the interested party is located.

                        satisfaction of the administering authority 
                        that all such merchandise, including 
                        significant components or ingredients of the 
                        covered merchandise, was or will be produced 
                        under conditions under which all employees 
                        receive adequate wages or sustainable 
                        production methods are maintained, the 
                        administering authority shall issue to that 
                        exporter or producer, upon request, a 
                        precertification with respect to wages, 
                        production methods, or both, that covers all

                        precertification for all covered merchandise 
                        imported from a country if the government of 
                        that country maintains and enforces laws 
                        requiring all producers of such merchandise in 
                        that country to pay its employees adequate 
                        wages and to maintain sustainable production 
                        methods.

                        the precertification applies shall not be 
                        subject to an antidumping duty solely because a 
                        petition filed under section 732(b)(1) of the 
                        Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673a(b)(1)) with

                        conditions under which all employees receive 
                        adequate wages and sustainable production

                        to covered merchandise covered by a 
                        precertification issued under subparagraph (A)

                        under which all employees receive adequate 
                        wages, sustainable production methods are
