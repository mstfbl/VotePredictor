        disasters.--In entering into an agreement for debris removal or 
        demolition services in connection with natural disaster 
        reconstruction efforts, the head of an executive agency shall 
        give a preference in the source selection process to each 
        offeror who certifies that any work that is to be performed 
        under the contract by subcontractors will be performed by local 
        subcontractors.
    (c) Applicability.--The requirements under subsection (b) shall 
apply to agreements entered into on or after the date of enactment of
