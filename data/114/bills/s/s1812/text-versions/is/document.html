        alien who--
                    (A) was arrested, charged, or convicted of an 
                offense described in section 101(a)(43) of the 
                Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43));

            (2) Sanctuary jurisdiction.--The term ``sanctuary 
        jurisdiction'' means a State or a political subdivision of a 
        State that has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that 
        prohibits law enforcement officers of the State, or of the 
        political subdivision, from assisting or cooperating with 
        Federal immigration law enforcement in the course of carrying 
        out the officers' routine law enforcement duties.

SEC. 3. LIMITS ON FEDERAL FUNDING FOR STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

    (a) In General.--A jurisdiction may not receive any of the funding 
described in subsection (b) if the jurisdiction does not cooperate with

deemed to be a priority for removal by the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, including by refusing--
            (1) to detain or transfer custody of such aliens pursuant 
        to detainers placed upon such aliens; or
            (2) to notify a Federal law enforcement agency, upon 
        request, of the release of such aliens.
    (b) Restricted Funding.--The funding described in this subsection 
consists of--
            (1) any of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to 
        the State or political subdivision under section 241(i) of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i));
            (2) any grant funding authorized under the Second Chance 
        Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-199); and
            (3) any other law enforcement related grants or contracts 
        awarded by the Department of Homeland Security or Department of 
        Justice, which may be designated by the relevant Secretary or 
        the Attorney General.
    (c) Termination of Ineligibility.--A jurisdiction shall become 
eligible to receive funds, grants, or contracts described in subsection 
(b) after the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the 
Attorney General, certifies that--
            (1) the jurisdiction no longer fails to cooperate with 
        Federal officials regarding detentions, transfers, and 
        notifications described in subsection (a); and
            (2) the statute, policy, or practice of that State or 
        political subdivision prohibiting law enforcement officers from 
        assisting or cooperating with Federal immigration law 
        enforcement with respect to criminal aliens has been repealed, 
        rescinded, or terminated.
    (d) Reallocation.--Any funds that are withheld from a jurisdiction 
pursuant to this section shall be reallocated by the Secretary of 
Homeland Security or by the Attorney General, in consultation with each 
other, equally among--
            (1) States and political subdivisions of States, which--
                    (A) cooperate with Federal officials regarding the 
                detentions, transfers, and notifications described 
                subsection (a); and
                    (B) submit an application to the appropriate 
                Department for such unobligated funds; and
            (2) any statutorily authorized Federal grant program 
        designed to protect victims of violence.

SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

    (a) Annual Publication.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security and the Attorney General shall jointly publish, on 
the websites of their respective departments--
            (1) a list of sanctuary jurisdictions; and

1326(a)) is amended, in the undesignated matter following paragraph 
(2)(B), by striking ``shall be fined under title 18, United States

under title 18, United States Code''.

SEC. 6. SAVINGS PROVISIONS.

    Nothing in this Act may be construed--
            (1) to require law enforcement officials of a State or a 
        political subdivision of a State to report or arrest victims or 
        witnesses of a criminal offense; or
            (2) to limit the ability of State and local law enforcement 
        to cooperate with Federal immigration law enforcement with 
        regard to aliens who are not criminal aliens.
