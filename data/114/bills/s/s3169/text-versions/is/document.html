                                 A BILL


 
To support basic energy research and eliminate the wind production tax 
                                credit.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) wind energy is a mature technology;
            (2) the wind production tax credit has been in effect for 
        24 years and has been extended 10 times;
            (3) wind subsidies can distort the electricity market and 
        make other sources of electric power less cost competitive;
            (4) between 2008 and 2014, the wind production tax credit 
        cost taxpayers $7,300,000,000;
            (5) for wind turbine construction started in 2017, 2018, 
        and 2019, the wind production tax credit would cost taxpayers 
        $8,100,000,000 over 10 years; and
            (6) doubling the amount of funds available for basic energy 
        research activities would--
                    (A) increase innovation in energy technologies; and
                    (B) produce clean, reliable, and affordable energy.

SEC. 2. INCREASED FUNDING AUTHORIZATION FOR THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE OF 
              THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

    Section 971(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 
16311(b)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (7), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting a semicolon; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) $8,524,000,000 for fiscal year 2017;
            ``(9) $8,936,000,000 for fiscal year 2018; and
            ``(10) $9,377,000,000 for fiscal year 2019.''.
