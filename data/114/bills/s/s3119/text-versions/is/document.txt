        original rule.

            (1) Determination.--On the date that is 61 days after the 
        date on which the debt limit is increased or a suspension of 
        the debt limit takes effect, the Director of the Office of

        Federal regulation during the 10-fiscal-year period described

        of Federal regulation during the 10-fiscal-year period 
        described in subsection (b)(1) by not less than 15 percent of 
        the amount of the increase in the debt limit, effective on the 
        date of the determination, the limitation in section 3101(b) of

        face amount of obligations issued under chapter 31 of title 31, 
        United States Code, and the face amount of obligations whose 
        principal and interest are guaranteed by the United States 
        Government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary 
        of the Treasury) outstanding on the date of the determination.
