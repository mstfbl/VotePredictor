                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for the issuance of a ``Gold Star Families Forever Stamp'' 
to honor the sacrifices of families who have lost a loved one who was a 
                 member of the Armed Forces in combat.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Families Forever Stamp 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) Gold Star mothers and fathers and families are true 
        national heroes, who deserve our deepest gratitude and respect; 
        and
            (2) the extraordinary contribution of Gold Star mothers and 
        fathers and families is beyond measure, not merely for their 
        loss, but the comfort they selflessly provide others and their 
        model of service and sacrifice.

SEC. 3. GOLD STAR FAMILIES FOREVER STAMP.

    (a) In General.--In order to continue to honor the sacrifices of 
families who have lost a loved one who was a member of the Armed Forces 
in combat, the Postmaster General shall provide for the issuance of a 
forever stamp suitable for that purpose.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``forever 
stamp'' means a definitive stamp which meets the postage required for 
first-class mail up to one ounce in weight, and which retains full 
validity for that purpose even if the rate of that postage is later 
increased.
    (c) Effective Date.--The stamp described in subsection (a) shall be 
issued beginning as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of 
this Act and shall not thereafter be discontinued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
