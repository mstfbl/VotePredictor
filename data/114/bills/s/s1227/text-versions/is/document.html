                                 A BILL


 
    To require the Secretary of Energy to develop an implementation 
 strategy to promote the development of hybrid micro-grid systems for 
                         isolated communities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. HYBRID MICRO-GRID SYSTEMS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Hybrid micro-grid system.--The term ``hybrid micro-grid 
        system'' means a stand-alone electrical system that is 
        comprised of conventional generation and at least 1 alternative 
        energy resource.
            (2) Isolated community.--The term ``isolated community'' 
        means a community that is powered by a stand-alone electric 
        generation and distribution system without the economic and 
        reliability benefits of connection to a regional electric grid.
            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Energy.
            (4) Strategy.--The term ``strategy'' means the strategy 
        developed pursuant to subsection (b).
    (b) Strategy.--The Secretary shall develop an implementation 
strategy to promote the development of hybrid micro-grid systems for 
isolated communities, particularly for those communities exposed to 
extreme weather conditions and high costs of energy, including 
electricity, space heating and cooling, and transportation.
    (c) Requirements.--In developing the strategy, the Secretary shall 
consider--
            (1) establishing future targets for the economic 
        displacement of conventional generation using hybrid micro-grid 
        systems, including displacement of conventional generation used 
        for electric power generation, heating and cooling, and 
        transportation;
            (2) the potential for renewable resources, including wind, 
        solar, and hydropower, to be integrated into a hybrid micro-
        grid system;
            (3) opportunities for improving the efficiency of existing 
        hybrid micro-grid systems;
            (4) the capacity of the local workforce to operate, 
        maintain, and repair a hybrid micro-grid system;
            (5) opportunities to develop the capacity of the local 
        workforce to operate, maintain, and repair a hybrid micro-grid 
        system;
            (6) leveraging existing capacity within local or regional 
        research organizations, such as organizations based at 
        institutions of higher education, to support development of 
        hybrid micro-grid systems, including by testing novel 
        components and systems prior to field deployment;
            (7) the need for basic infrastructure to develop, deploy, 
        and sustain a hybrid micro-grid system;
            (8) input of traditional knowledge from local leaders of 
        isolated communities in the development of a hybrid micro-grid 
        system;
            (9) the impact of hybrid micro-grid systems on defense, 
        homeland security, economic development, and environmental 
        interests;
            (10) opportunities to leverage existing interagency 
        coordination efforts and recommendations for new interagency 
        coordination efforts to minimize unnecessary overhead, 
        mobilization, and other project costs; and
            (11) any other criteria the Secretary determines 
        appropriate.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a 
report on the status of the strategy and efforts to implement the 
strategy.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
