To amend the Pilot's Bill of Rights to facilitate appeals and to apply 
to other certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, to 
     require the revision of the third class medical certification 
  regulations issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Pilot's Bill of Rights 
2''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. MEDICAL CERTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SMALL AIRCRAFT 
              PILOTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue or revise medical certification regulations 
to ensure that an individual may operate as pilot in command of a 
covered aircraft without regard to any medical certification or proof 
of health requirement otherwise applicable under Federal law if--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the individual possesses a valid State 
        driver's license and complies with any medical requirement 
        associated with that license;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the individual is transporting not more than 5 
        passengers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the individual is operating under visual 
        flight rules or instrument flight rules; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the relevant flight, including each portion 
        thereof, is not carried out--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) for compensation, including that no 
                passenger or property on the flight is being carried 
                for compensation;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) at an altitude that is more than 
                14,000 feet above mean sea level;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) outside the United States, unless 
                authorized by the country in which the flight is 
                conducted; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) at an indicated air speed exceeding 
                250 knots.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Covered Aircraft Defined.--In this section, the term 
``covered aircraft'' means an aircraft that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) is not authorized under Federal law to carry 
        more than 6 occupants; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 
        not more than 6,000 pounds.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Report Required.--Not later than 5 years after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to 
Congress a report that describes the effect of the regulations issued 
or revised under subsection (a) and includes statistics with respect to 
changes in small aircraft activity and safety incidents.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Prohibition on Enforcement Actions.--On and after the 
date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator may not take an enforcement action for not holding a 
valid third-class medical certificate against a pilot of a covered 
aircraft for a flight if the pilot and the flight meet the applicable 
requirements under paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) unless 
the Administrator has published final regulations in the Federal 
Register under subsection (a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        affected by the decision may, at the person's election, file an

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings and Purpose.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Findings.--Congress finds the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Many volunteer pilot nonprofit 
                organizations fly for public benefit and provide 
                valuable services to communities and 
                individuals.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) In each calendar year, volunteer pilot 
                nonprofit organizations provide long-distance, no-cost 
                transportation for tens of thousands of people during 
                times of special need.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) Such nonprofit organizations are no 
                longer able to purchase liability insurance for 
                aircraft they do not own to provide liability 
                protection at a reasonable price, and therefore face a 
                highly detrimental liability risk.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Such nonprofit organizations have 
                supported the homeland security of the United States by 
                providing volunteer pilot services during times of 
                national emergency.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to 
        promote the activities of volunteer pilot nonprofit 
        organizations that fly for public benefit and to sustain the 
        availability of the services that such nonprofit organizations 
        provide, including the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Transportation at no cost to 
                financially needy medical patients for medical 
                treatment, evaluation, and diagnosis.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Flights for humanitarian and 
                charitable purposes.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) Other flights of compassion.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Liability Protection for Volunteer Pilot Nonprofit 
Organizations That Fly for Public Benefit and to Pilots and Staff of 
Such Nonprofit Organizations.--Section 4 of the Volunteer Protection 
Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 14503) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in subsection (a)(4)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and 
                (B) as clauses (i) and (ii), respectively;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) by striking ``the harm'' and inserting 
                ``(A) except in the case of subparagraph (B), the 
                harm'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as 
                redesignated by this paragraph, by striking the period 
                at the end and inserting ``; and''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) by adding at the end the 
                following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) the volunteer--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(i) was operating an aircraft in 
                        furtherance of the purpose of a volunteer pilot 
                        nonprofit organization that flies for public 
                        benefit; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(ii) was properly licensed and 
                        insured for the operation of such aircraft.''; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in subsection (c)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) by striking ``Nothing in this 
                section'' and inserting the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (2), nothing in this section''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) by adding at the end the 
                following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2) Exception.--A volunteer pilot nonprofit 
        organization that flies for public benefit, the staff, mission 
        coordinators, officers, and directors (whether volunteer or 
        otherwise) of that nonprofit organization, and a referring 
        agency of that nonprofit organization shall not be liable for 
        harm caused to any person by a volunteer of the nonprofit 
        organization while the volunteer--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) is operating an aircraft in 
                furtherance of the purpose of the nonprofit 
                organization;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) is properly licensed for the 
                operation of the aircraft; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) has certified to the nonprofit 
                organization that the volunteer has insurance covering
