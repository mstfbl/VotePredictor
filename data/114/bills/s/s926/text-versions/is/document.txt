                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the patent law to promote basic research, to stimulate 
  publication of scientific documents, to encourage collaboration in 
  scientific endeavors, to improve the transfer of technology to the 
                private sector, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Grace Period Restoration Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Language in the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (Public 
        Law 112-29; 125 Stat. 284) and regulations and examination 
        guidelines issued by the United States Patent and Trademark 
        Office implementing provisions of that Act have created 
        uncertainty regarding the scope of the 1-year grace period 
        during which an inventor who discloses an invention to the 
        public may decide whether to file a patent application for the 
        invention (referred to in this Act as the ``grace period'').
            (2) The regulatory reading of the Leahy-Smith America 
        Invents Act does not comport with the intent of the sponsors of 
        that Act.
            (3) In performing more than 50 percent of all basic 
        research in the United States and pursuing the transfer of 
        research results to the private sector for the benefit of the 
        public under the auspices of chapter 18 of title 35, United 
        States Code (commonly known as the ``Bayh-Dole Act''), 
        institutions of higher education and government laboratories 
        face a difficult and expensive challenge in gaining and 
        utilizing the full scope of patent rights.
            (4) The uncertainty relating to the grace period created by 
        the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act adds to the challenge faced 
        by institutions of higher education and government laboratories 
        in gaining and utilizing the full scope of patent rights.
            (5) Job growth and the creation of start-up companies and 
        small businesses are thwarted by uncertainty as to the scope of 
        the grace period and by the difficulty and expense of gaining 
        and utilizing patent rights, which hinders the economy of the 
        United States and the technological leadership of the United 
        States in a competitive global economy.
            (6) Ambiguity and uncertainty in statutory text and 
        government regulations breed abusive and expensive patent 
        litigation.
            (7) Discouragement of scientific research publication--
                    (A) delays the disclosure of scientific advances to 
                the public;
                    (B) thwarts scientific advances;
                    (C) chills collaborative research activities; and
                    (D) delays, if not denies, the opportunity for the 
                public to realize the benefits of research results.
            (8) Misappropriation by third parties of disclosed 
        inventions is likely to increase, especially in countries that 
        take advantage of the technological prowess of the United 
        States without appropriately compensating inventors.
            (9) Secrecy is anathema to--
                    (A) the maintenance of a viable United States 
                patent system;
                    (B) the constitutional purpose of the United States 
                patent system; and
                    (C) the goal of the United States patent system of 
                promoting scientific progress.
            (10) In the words of David J. Kappos, who served as the 
        Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and 
        Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
        during the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 
        the grace period before the enactment of the Leahy-Smith 
        America Invents Act was ``the gold standard of best 
        practices''.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to correct the drafting problem in the Leahy-Smith 
        America Invents Act relating to the grace period; and
            (2) to maintain the position of leadership of the United 
        States in educational, technological, and scientific progress.
