                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 to 
provide for the development of methane hydrate as a commercially viable 
                           source of energy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Methane Hydrate Research and 
Development Amendments Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE METHANE HYDRATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT 
              OF 2000.

    (a) Findings.--Section 2 of the Methane Hydrate Research and 
Development Act of 2000 (30 U.S.C. 2001) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (4), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (5), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting a semicolon; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(6) methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that may be 
        exchanged between terrestrial methane hydrate reservoirs and 
        the atmosphere by natural or anthropogenic processes; and
            ``(7) the short- and long-term release of methane from 
        arctic or marine reservoirs may have significant environmental 
        effects, including global climate change.''.
    (b) Methane Hydrate Research and Development Program.--
            (1) In general.--Section 4 of the Methane Hydrate Research 
        and Development Act of 2000 (30 U.S.C. 2003) is amended by

                Mexico or the Atlantic Ocean Basin by the date that is 
                4 years after the date of enactment of the Methane 
                Hydrate Research and Development Amendments Act of
