SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) With a value that may be as high as $10,000,000,000 per 
        year, the illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products is 
        one of the most lucrative criminal activities globally, 
        dominated by sophisticated transnational criminal networks that 
        connect poachers to high-end markets for illegal wildlife 
        products and that are linked to other transnational organized 
        criminal activities, including trafficking in narcotics, 
        weapons, and humans.
            (2) The poaching of and illegal trade in wildlife, 
        including elephants and rhinoceroses, is rapidly escalating in 
        scale, sophistication, and violence, and there is evidence that 
        illegal trade in high-value wildlife parts, including elephant 
        ivory, is being used as a source of financing for criminal 
        organizations and armed groups that pose a threat to United 
        States economic and security interests in Africa and elsewhere, 
        including terrorist organizations and militias.
            (3) Increasing consumer demand for rhinoceros horn and 
        elephant ivory, in Asia and elsewhere, has caused the prices of 
        both to escalate, with the price of rhinoceros horn rivaling 
        that of gold or heroin by weight, further driving the poaching 
        and trafficking of rhinoceroses and elephants.
            (4) In 2014, 1,215 rhinoceroses were illegally killed in 
        South Africa, which represents an increase of more than 9,000 
        percent since 2007.
            (5) Two subspecies of African rhinoceroses and 1 subspecies 
        of Asian rhinoceros have gone extinct since 2005, and 2 of 3 
        Asian rhinoceros species have fallen to critically low 
        population numbers.
            (6) Data from the Monitoring the Illegal Killing of 
        Elephants program established under the Convention on 
        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
        Flora, done at Washington March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; TIAS 
        8249) (commonly referred to as ``CITES'') and academic studies 
        indicated that 100,000 elephants were killed illegally across 
        the whole of Africa between 2010 and 2012.
            (7) From 2000 to 2011, 54 large-scale ivory seizures world-
        wide captured more than 110,000 kilograms of ivory. More than 
        half of those large-scale seizures occurred between 2008 and 
        2011, indicating an increasing demand for ivory and expanding 
        participation by organized crime in the illegal trade in ivory.
            (8) Wildlife crime threatens elephants, rhinoceros, and 
        tigers greatly, but also has a devastating impact on a number 
        of other species, including sharks, pangolins, great apes, and 
        turtles.
            (9) In addition to threatening the survival of imperiled 
        species, wildlife poachers and traffickers frequently kill park 
        rangers devoted to protecting their countries' wildlife, 
        destabilize communities through violence and corruption of 
        local law enforcement officials and others, and threaten 
        wildlife tourism industries, which contribute significantly to 
        the local and national economies of many countries.
            (10) Where wildlife is well-managed by communities or in 
        partnership with others, it can provide a significant and 
        sustainable source of economic activity, particularly in 
        impoverished rural areas, and when communities share in the 
        revenues generated by wildlife-based economic development, it 
        can greatly reduce incentives to engage in poaching activities 
        while greatly increasing incentives to protect wildlife.
            (11) At the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties 
        to CITES, held in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 2013, all parties 
        to CITES agreed to work to help eradicate poaching of 
        rhinoceroses, elephants, sharks, and other species, and the 
        illegal trade in their parts.
            (12) The United States can play a pivotal role in ensuring 
        that countries meet their international obligations under CITES 
        and take additional positive steps to address the wildlife 
        trafficking crisis and the global illegal trade in elephants, 
        rhinoceroses, and other species, including through sustained 
        diplomatic engagement.
