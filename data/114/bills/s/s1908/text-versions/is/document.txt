                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Higher Education Opportunity Act to restrict institutions 
     of higher education from using revenues derived from Federal 
educational assistance funds for advertising, marketing, or recruiting 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting 
Financial Aid for Students and Taxpayers Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 1998 to 2013, enrollment in for-profit 
        institutions of higher education increased by 314 percent, from 
        498,176 students to 2,064,920 students.
            (2) In the 2012-2013 academic year, students who enrolled 
        at for-profit institutions of higher education received 
        $26,469,028,523 in Federal Pell Grants and student loans.
            (3) Eight out of the 10 top recipients of Post- 9/11 
        Educational Assistance funds are for-profit institutions of 
        higher education. These 8 companies have received 
        $2,900,000,000 in taxpayer funds to enroll veterans from 2009 
        to 2013.
            (4) An analysis of 15 publicly traded companies that 
        operate institutions of higher education shows that, on 
        average, such companies spend 28 percent of expenditures on 
        advertising, marketing, and recruiting.

SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR RECRUITING AND MARKETING 
              ACTIVITIES.

    Section 119 of the Higher Education Opportunity Act (20 U.S.C.

        through (c)'' and inserting ``subsections (a), (b), (c), and 
        (e)'';
            (3) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and
            (4) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:
