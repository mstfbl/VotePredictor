                Prevention for safely prescribing opioids for the 
                treatment of chronic, non-cancer pain in outpatient 
                settings upon the release of such guidelines by the 
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
                    (B) Enhanced guidance with respect to absolute 
                contraindications for opioid therapy, including 
                guidance with respect to the following:
                            (i) The coadministration of drugs that are 
                        capable of inducing a life-limiting drug-drug 
                        interaction, including benzodiazepines.
                            (ii) The treatment of patients with current 
                        acute psychiatric instability or substance use 
                        disorder or patients at risk of suicide.
                            (iii) The use of opioid therapy to treat 
                        patients without any pain, including to treat 
                        mental health disorders other than opioid use 
                        disorder.
                    (C) Enhanced guidance with respect to the treatment 
                of patients with behaviors or comorbidities, such as 
                post-traumatic stress disorder, psychiatric disorders, 
                or a history of substance abuse or addiction, that 
                require consultation or comanagement of opioid therapy 
                with one or more specialists in pain management, mental 
                health, or addictions.
                    (D) Enhanced guidance with respect to the conduct 
                by health care providers of an effectiveness assessment 
                for patients receiving opioid therapy, including 
                patients on long-term opioid therapy, to determine--
                            (i) whether opioid therapy is meeting the 
                        expected goals of the patient and health care 
                        provider of relieving pain and improving 
                        function; and
                            (ii) whether opioid therapy should be 
                        continued.

                Therapy Risk Report tool of the Department, including 
                by accessing the most recent patient information from 
                the prescription drug monitoring program of each State, 
                as required to be included in such tool under section 
                422(d)(1), to assess the risk for adverse outcomes of 
                opioid therapy for the patient, including the 
                concurrent use of controlled substances such as 
                benzodiazepines, as part of the comprehensive 
                assessment conducted by the health care provider.
                    (F) Guidelines to govern the methodologies used by 
                health care providers of the Department of Veterans 
                Affairs and the Department of Defense to safely titrate

                            (ii) use of opioids only for a limited 
                        period of time; and
                            (iii) augmentation of opioid therapy with 
                        other pain management therapies and modalities.
                    (G) Guidelines with respect to appropriate case 
                management for patients receiving opioid therapy who 
                transition between inpatient and outpatient health care 
                settings, which may include the use of care transition 
                plans.
                    (H) Enhanced recommendations with respect to the 
                use of routine and random urine drug tests for all 
                patients before and during opioid therapy to help 
                prevent substance abuse, dependence, and diversion, 
                including requirements--
                            (i) that such tests occur not less 
                        frequently than once each year; and
                            (ii) that health care providers 
                        appropriately interpret and respond to the 
                        results from such tests to tailor pain therapy, 
                        safeguards, and risk management strategies to 
                        each patient.
                    (I) Guidance that health care providers discuss 
                with patients, before initiating opioid therapy, 
                options for pain management therapies without the use 
                of opioids and options to augment opioid therapy with 
                other clinical and complementary and integrative health
