        maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska Native 
        peoples in the planning and the management of Alaska Native 
        education programs and to support efforts developed by and 
        undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve 
        educational opportunity for all students.

        challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to 
        successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native 
        students in rural, village, and urban settings is challenging. 
        Significant disparities between academic achievement of Alaska 
        Native students and non-Native students continues, including 
        lower graduation rates, increased school dropout rates, and 
        lower achievement scores on standardized tests.

        Alaska Native students, and local, place-based, and culture-
        based programming are critical to the attainment of educational 
        success and the long-term well-being of Alaska Native students.

        developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community 
        to improve educational opportunity for Alaska Native students. 
        In 1983, pursuant to Public Law 98-63, Alaska ceased to receive 
        educational funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 
        Bureau of Indian Education does not operate any schools in

SEC. 10205. POSTHUMOUS PARDON.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, 
        and controversial figure in the history of the United States 
        who challenged racial biases.
            (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to 
        parents who were former slaves.
            (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled 
        throughout the United States, fighting White and African-
        American heavyweights.
            (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the 
        opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson 
        was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight 
        the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.
            (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first 
        African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of 
        the World.
            (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a 
        search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a 
        recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great 
        white hope''.
            (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries 
        left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.
            (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed 
        the ``Battle of the Century''.
            (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to 
        rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the 
        racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the 
        United States.
            (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women 
        compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.
            (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were 
        lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White 
        women.
            (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 
        (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the 
        ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the 
        transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce ``for 
        the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other 
        immoral purpose''.
            (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a 
        White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship and 
        sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming that 
        Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.
            (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on 
        October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State lines 
        for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann Act.
            (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped 
        when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, 
        and then married Jack Johnson.
            (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White 
        woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson 
        had transported her across States lines for the purpose of 
        ``prostitution and debauchery''.
            (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the 
        Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.
            (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and 
        various European and South American countries.
            (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title 
        to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.
            (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July 
        1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in 
        the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.
            (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, 
        but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.
            (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War 
        II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating 
        in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.
            (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.
            (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing 
        Hall of Fame.
            (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, 
        agreed to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th 
        Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon 
        for his racially-motivated 1913 conviction.
    (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that Jack 
Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--
            (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the 
        prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the 
        annals of criminal justice in the United States; and
            (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural 
        contributions of Jack Johnson to society.
