    Native community to improve educational opportunity for all 
    students.
        ``(2) Many Alaska Native children enter and exit school with 
    serious educational disadvantages.
        ``(3) Overcoming the magnitude of the geographic challenges, 
    historical inequities, and other barriers to successfully improving 
    educational outcomes for Alaska Native students in rural, village, 
    and urban settings is challenging. Significant disparities between 
    academic achievement of Alaska Native students and non-Native

    increases access to employment opportunities.
        ``(6) The Federal Government should lend support to efforts

    improve educational opportunity for Alaska Native students. In 
    1983, pursuant to Public Law 98-63, Alaska ceased to receive 
    educational funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau 
    of Indian Education does not operate any schools in Alaska, nor 
    operate or fund Alaska Native education programs. The program under 
    this part supports the Federal trust responsibility of the United 
    States to Alaska Natives.''.

                   PART B--MISCELLANEOUS; OTHER LAWS

SEC. 9201. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) There are significant anecdotal reports that some schools 
    and local educational agencies have failed to properly report 
    allegations of sexual misconduct by employees, contractors, or 
    agents.
        (2) Instead of reporting alleged sexual misconduct to the 
    appropriate authorities, such as the police or child welfare 
    services, reports suggest that some schools or local educational 
    agencies have kept information on allegations of sexual misconduct 
    private or have entered into confidentiality agreements with the 
    suspected employee, contractor, or agent who agrees to terminate 
    employment with or discontinue work for the school or local 
    educational agency.
        (3) The practice of withholding information on allegations of 
    sexual misconduct can facilitate the exposure of other students in 
    other jurisdictions to sexual misconduct.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) confidentiality agreements between local educational 
    agencies or schools and child predators should be prohibited;
        (2) local educational agencies or schools should not facilitate 
    the transfer of child predators to other local educational agencies 
    or schools; and
        (3) States should require local educational agencies and 
    schools to report any and all information regarding allegations of 
    sexual misconduct to law enforcement and other appropriate 
    authorities.
SEC. 9202. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
    It is the sense of Congress that a student, teacher, school 
administrator, or other school employee of an elementary school or 
secondary school retains the individual's rights under the First 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States during the school 
day or while on the grounds of an elementary school or secondary 
school.
SEC. 9203. PREVENTING IMPROPER USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS.

    the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 
    et seq.) display, in a public place, the hotline contact 
    information of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of 
    Education so that any individual who observes, detects, or suspects 
    improper use of taxpayer funds can easily report such improper use;
        (2) annually notify employees of the Department of Education of 
    their responsibility to report fraud; and
        (3) require any applicant--
            (A) for a grant under such Act to provide an assurance to 
        the Secretary that any information submitted when applying for 
        such grant and responding to monitoring and compliance reviews 
        is truthful and accurate; and
            (B) for a subgrant under such Act to provide the assurance 
        described in subparagraph (A) to the entity awarding the 
        subgrant.
SEC. 9204. ACCOUNTABILITY TO TAXPAYERS THROUGH MONITORING AND 
OVERSIGHT.
    To improve monitoring and oversight of taxpayer funds authorized 
for appropriation under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), and to deter and prohibit waste, fraud, 
and abuse with respect to such funds, the Secretary of Education 
shall--
        (1) notify each recipient of a grant under such Act (and, if 
    applicable, require the grantee to inform each subgrantee) of its 
    responsibility to--
            (A) comply with all monitoring requirements under the 
        applicable program or programs; and
            (B) monitor properly any subgrantee under the applicable 
        program or programs;
        (2) review and analyze the results of monitoring and compliance 
    reviews--
            (A) to understand trends and identify common issues; and
            (B) to issue guidance to help grantees address such issues 
        before the loss or misuse of taxpayer funding occurs;
        (3) publicly report the work undertaken by the Secretary to 
    prevent fraud, waste, and abuse with respect to such taxpayer 
    funds; and
        (4) work with the Office of Inspector General of the Department 
    of Education, as needed, to help ensure that employees of the 
    Department understand how to adequately monitor grantees and to 
    help grantees adequately monitor any subgrantees.
SEC. 9205. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR 
GENERAL REPORTS.
    (a) In General.--Not later than 6 months after the date of

SEC. 9206. POSTHUMOUS PARDON.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, and 
    controversial figure in the history of the United States who 
    challenged racial biases.
        (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to 
    parents who were former slaves.
        (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled 
    throughout the United States, fighting White and African-American 
    heavyweights.
        (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the 
    opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson was 
    granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight the 
    reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.
        (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first 
    African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of the 
    World.
        (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a 
    search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a recruitment 
    effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great white hope''.
        (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries left 
    retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.
        (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed the 
    ``Battle of the Century''.
        (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to rioting, 
    aggression against African-Americans, and the racially-motivated 
    murder of African-Americans throughout the United States.
        (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women 
    compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.
        (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were lynched, 
    some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White women.
        (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 
    (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the ``Mann 
    Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the transportation 
    of women in interstate or foreign commerce ``for the purpose of 
    prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose''.
        (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a White 
    woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship and sought 
    action from the Department of Justice, claiming that Jack Johnson 
    had abducted her daughter.
        (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on October 
    18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State lines for an 
    ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann Act.
        (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped 
    when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, and 
    then married Jack Johnson.
        (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White woman 
    named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson had 
    transported her across State lines for the purpose of 
    ``prostitution and debauchery''.
        (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the Mann 
    Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.
        (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and various 
    European and South American countries.
        (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title to 
    Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.
        (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July 1920, 
    surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in the Federal 
    penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.
        (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, but 
    never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.
        (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War II 
    by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating in 
    exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.
        (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.
        (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing Hall of 
    Fame.
        (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, agreed to 
    July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th Congress that Jack 
    Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon for his racially-
    motivated 1913 conviction.
    (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that Jack 
Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--
        (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the prosecutorial 
    authority of the Federal Government from the annals of criminal 
    justice in the United States; and
        (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural contributions 
    of Jack Johnson to society.

SEC. 9211. STUDY ON THE TITLE I FORMULA.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
    Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) provides funding to local 
    educational agencies through four separate formulas that have been 
    added to the law over time, and which have ``distinct allocation 
    patterns, providing varying shares of allocated funds to different 
    types of local educational agencies or States,'' according to a 
    2015 report from the Congressional Research Service.
        (2) Minimal effort has been made by the Federal Government to 
    determine if the four formulas are adequately delivering funds to 
    local educational agencies with the highest districtwide poverty 
    averages.
        (3) The formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and Education 
    Finance Incentive grants use two weighting systems, one based on 
    the percentage of children included in the determination of grants 
    to local educational agencies (percentage weighting), and another 
    based on the absolute number of such children (number weighting). 
    Both weighting systems have five quintiles with a roughly equal 
    number of children in each quintile. Whichever of these weighting 
    systems results in the highest total weighted formula child count 
    for a local educational agency is the weighting system used for 
    that agency in the final allocation of Targeted and Education 
    Finance Incentive Grant funds.
        (4) The Congressional Research Service has also said the number 
    weighting alternative is generally more favorable to large local 
    educational agencies with much larger geographic boundaries and 
    larger counts of eligible children than smaller local educational 
    agencies with smaller counts, but potentially higher percentages, 
    of eligible children, because large local educational agencies have 
    many more children in the higher weighted quintiles.
        (5) In local educational agencies that are classified by the 
    National Center for Education Statistics as ``Large City'', 47 
    percent of all students attend schools with 75 percent or higher 
    poverty.
    (b) Study.--
        (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
    enactment of this Act, the Director of the Institute of Education 
    Sciences shall complete a study on the effectiveness of the four 
    part A of title I formulas, described in subsection (a), to deliver 
    funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities.
        (2) Contents.--The study described in paragraph (1) shall 
    include--
            (A) an analysis of the distribution of part A of title I 
        funds under the four formulas;
            (B) an analysis of how part A of title I funds are 
        distributed among local educational agencies in each of the 12 
        locale types classified by the National Center on Education 
        Statistics.
            (C) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or 
        unduly disadvantage any of the local educational agencies 
        described in subparagraph (B);
            (D) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or 
        unduly disadvantage high-poverty eligible school attendance 
        areas in the local educational agencies described in 
        subparagraph (B);
            (E) the extent to which the four formulas unduly benefit or 
        unduly disadvantage lower population local educational agencies 
        with relatively high percentages of districtwide poverty;
            (F) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting 
        in the formulas for distributing Targeted Grants and Education 
        Finance Incentive Grants on each of the local educational 
        agencies described in subparagraph (B);
            (G) the impact of number weighting and percentage weighting 
        on targeting part A of title I funds to eligible school 
        attendance areas with the highest concentrations of poverty in 
        local educational agencies described in subparagraph (B), and 
        local educational agencies described in subparagraph (B) with 
        higher percentages of districtwide poverty;
            (H) an analysis of other studies and reports produced by 
        public and non-public entities examining the distribution of 
        part A of title I funds under the four formulas; and
            (I) recommendations, as appropriate, for amending or 
        consolidating the formulas to better target part A of title I 
        funds to the most economically disadvantaged communities and 
        most economically disadvantaged eligible school attendance 
        areas.
        (3) Public dissemination.--The Director of the Institute of 
    Education Sciences shall widely disseminate the findings of the 
    study conducted under this section--
            (A) in a timely fashion;
            (B) to--
                (i) the public; and
                (ii) the Committee on Education and the Workforce of 
            the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
            Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate; and
            (C) through electronic transfer and other means, such as 
        posting to the website of the Institute of Education Sciences 
        or the Department of Education.
