            (2) by redesignating section 1004 as section 1003; and
            (3) in section 1003, as redesignated by paragraph (2), by 
        adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Technical Assistance and Support.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each State may reserve not more than 4 
        percent of the amount the State receives under subpart 2 of 
        part A for a fiscal year to carry out paragraph (2) and to 
        carry out the State educational agency's responsibilities under 
        section 1114(a), including carrying out the State educational 
        agency's statewide system of technical assistance and support 
        for local educational agencies.

        any fiscal year, the State educational agency--
                    ``(A) shall use not less than 95 percent of such 
                amount by allocating such sums directly to local 
                educational agencies for activities required under 
                section 1114; or
                    ``(B) may, with the approval of the local

                service agencies, or other nonprofit or for-profit 
                organizations that use evidence-based strategies to 
                improve student achievement, teaching, and schools.
            ``(3) Priority.--The State educational agency, in 
        allocating funds to local educational agencies under this 
        subsection, shall give priority to local educational agencies 
        that--

                performing schools to improve student achievement and 
                student outcomes.
            ``(4) Unused funds.--If, after consultation with local 
        educational agencies in the State, the State educational agency 
        determines that the amount of funds reserved to carry out this 
        subsection for a fiscal year is greater than the amount needed 
        to provide the assistance described in this subsection, the 
        State educational agency shall allocate the excess amount to 
        local educational agencies in accordance with--
                    ``(A) the relative allocations the State 
                educational agency made to those agencies for that 
                fiscal year under subpart 2 of part A; or

        this subsection, the amount of funds reserved by the State 
        educational agency under this subsection in any fiscal year 
        shall not decrease the amount of funds each local educational 
        agency receives under subpart 2 of part A below the amount 
        received by such local educational agency under such subpart 
        for the preceding fiscal year.
            ``(6) Reporting.--Each State educational agency shall make 
        publicly available a list of those schools that have received 
        funds or services pursuant to this subsection and the 
        percentage of students from each such school from families with 
        incomes below the poverty line.''.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report that--
            (1) describes any barriers to coordination between local 
        educational agencies and child welfare agencies, including in 
        Federal law or regulation, such as the Fostering Connections to 
        Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-
        351; 122 Stat. 3949);
            (2) describes the benefits and challenges of keeping a 
        foster care child in the school of origin when such child moves 
        to a new school attendance area as a result of being placed in 
        foster care, changing foster care placements, or leaving foster 
        care, including--
                    (A) the academic impact of increased stability as a 
                result of such child remaining in the school of origin;
                    (B) challenges for local educational agencies and 
                child welfare agencies as a result of such child 
                remaining in the school of origin, including challenges 
                associated with transportation;
                    (C) estimates of transportation costs if such child 
                stays in the school of origin; and
                    (D) an analysis of the most appropriate entity to 
                pay transportation costs for a foster care child who is 
                changing or leaving placements and remaining in the 
                school of origin;
            (3) examines barriers to credit transfer, including 
        awarding partial credit for coursework, for a child in foster 
        care who is changing schools;
            (4) examines the impact on local educational agencies of a 
        local educational agency designating an individual as a point 
        of contact for a child welfare agency, including--
                    (A) the entity most suited to having the 
                responsibility for outreach on behalf of the education 
                of a child in foster care enrolled in a school; and
                    (B) the benefits and limitations of designating the 
                local educational agency liaison under section 
                722(g)(1)(J)(ii) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless 
                Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11432(g)(1)(J)(ii)) as the 
                same point of contact at the local educational agency 
                for children in foster care;
            (5) describes the impact of removing children who are 
        awaiting foster care placement from coverage under subtitle B 
        of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 
        U.S.C. 11431 et seq.); and
            (6) examines the extent to which the child welfare system 
        takes into account a child's educational stability when 
        determining such child's foster care placement.

Secretary's determination under subsection (i) is in error for 
statistical or other substantive reasons, the local educational agency 
may provide supporting evidence to the Secretary, and the Secretary 
shall consider that evidence before making a final termination 
determination.

section, consistent with section 9601 and specifically on improving the 
equitable distribution of State and local funding and increasing 
student achievement.
    ``(l) Renewal of Local Flexibility Demonstration Agreement.--The 
Secretary may renew for additional 3-year terms a local flexibility 
demonstration agreement under this section if--

        under subsections (d)(2) and (e) and agrees to and has a high 
        likelihood of continuing to meet such requirements; and

`high-poverty school' means a school that is in the highest 2 quartiles 
of schools served by a local educational agency, based on the 
percentage of enrolled students from low-income families.''.

SEC. 7003. ALASKA NATIVE EDUCATION.

        maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska Native 
        peoples in the planning and the management of Alaska Native 
        education programs and to support efforts developed by and 
        undertaken within the Alaska Native community to improve 
        educational opportunity for all students.

        challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to 
        successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native 
        students in rural, village, and urban settings is challenging. 
        Significant disparities between academic achievement of Alaska 
        Native students and non-Native students continues, including 
        lower graduation rates, increased school dropout rates, and 
        lower achievement scores on standardized tests.

        developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native community 
        to improve educational opportunity for Alaska Native students. 
        In 1983, pursuant to Public Law 98-63, Alaska ceased to receive 
        educational funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 
        Bureau of Indian Education does not operate any schools in
