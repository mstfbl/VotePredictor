           TITLE I--TRADE FACILITATION AND TRADE ENFORCEMENT

SEC. 101. IMPROVING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--In order to advance the security, trade 
enforcement, and trade facilitation missions of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, the Commissioner shall ensure that partnership programs of 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection established before the date of the 
enactment of this Act, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against 
Terrorism established under subtitle B of title II of the Security and 
Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 961 et seq.), and 
partnership programs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection established 
after such date of enactment, provide trade benefits to private sector 
entities that meet the requirements for participation in those programs 
established by the Commissioner under this section.
    (b) Elements.--In developing and operating partnership programs 
under subsection (a), the Commissioner shall--
            (1) consult with private sector entities, the public, and 
        other Federal agencies when appropriate, to ensure that 
        participants in those programs receive commercially significant 
        and measurable trade benefits, including providing preclearance 
        of merchandise for qualified persons that demonstrate the 
        highest levels of compliance with the customs and trade laws of 
        the United States, regulations of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection, and other requirements the Commissioner determines 
        to be necessary;
            (2) ensure an integrated and transparent system of trade 
        benefits and compliance requirements for all partnership 
        programs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
            (3) consider consolidating partnership programs in 
        situations in which doing so would support the objectives of 
        such programs, increase participation in such programs, enhance 
        the trade benefits provided to participants in such programs, 
        and enhance the allocation of the resources of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection;
            (4) coordinate with the Director of U.S. Immigration and 
        Customs Enforcement, and other Federal agencies with authority

                Trade Data System;
                    (B) to ensure that the partnership programs of 
                those agencies are compatible with the partnership 
                programs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
                    (C) to develop criteria for authorizing the 
                release, on an expedited basis, of merchandise for 
                which documentation is required from one or more of 
                those agencies to clear or license the merchandise for 
                entry into the United States; and
                    (D) to create pathways, within and among the 
                appropriate Federal agencies, for qualified persons 
                that demonstrate the highest levels of compliance to 
                receive immediate clearance absent information that a 
                transaction may pose a national security or compliance 
                threat; and
            (5) ensure that trade benefits are provided to participants 
        in partnership programs.

                or to initiate or participate in negotiations with 
                respect to a bilateral or regional trade agreement with 
                that country, the extent to which that country has 
                failed to adopt appropriate policies to correct the 
                undervaluation and surpluses described in subsection 
                (b)(1)(A).
            (2) Exception.--The President may not apply a prohibition

                of Management and Budget to determine whether such

                appropriate committees of Congress with respect to any

TITLE VIII--PROCESS FOR CONSIDERATION OF TEMPORARY DUTY SUSPENSIONS AND 
                               REDUCTIONS

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``American Manufacturing 
Competitiveness Act of 2015''.

SEC. 802. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A MISCELLANEOUS TARIFF 
              BILL.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States imposes duties 
        on imported goods for which there is no domestic availability 
        or insufficient domestic availability.
            (2) The imposition of duties on such goods creates 
        artificial distortions in the economy of the United States that 
        negatively affect United States manufacturers and consumers.
            (3) It is in the interests of the United States to update 
        the Harmonized Tariff Schedule every 3 years to eliminate such 
        artificial distortions by suspending or reducing duties on such 
        goods.
            (4) The manufacturing competitiveness of the United States 
        around the world will be enhanced if Congress regularly and 
        predictably updates the Harmonized Tariff Schedule to suspend 
        or reduce duties on such goods.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to remove 
the competitive disadvantage to United States manufactures and 
consumers resulting from an outdated Harmonized Tariff Schedule and to 
promote the competitiveness of United States manufacturers, Congress 
should consider a miscellaneous tariff bill not later than 180 days 
after the United States International Trade Commission and the 
Department of Commerce issue reports on proposed duty suspensions and 
reductions under this title.

SEC. 803. PROCESS FOR CONSIDERATION OF DUTY SUSPENSIONS AND REDUCTIONS.

    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to establish a 
process by the appropriate congressional committees, in conjunction 
with the Commission pursuant to its authorities under section 332 of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332), for the submission and 
consideration of proposed duty suspensions and reductions.
    (b) Establishment.--Not later than October 15, 2015, and October 
15, 2018, the appropriate congressional committees shall establish and, 
on the same day, publish on their respective publicly available 
Internet websites a process--
            (1) to provide for the submission and consideration of 
        legislation containing proposed duty suspensions and reductions 
        in a manner that, to the maximum extent practicable, is 
        consistent with the requirements described in subsection (c); 
        and
            (2) to include in a miscellaneous tariff bill those duty 
        suspensions and reductions that meet the requirements of this 
        title.
    (c) Requirements of Commission.--
            (1) Initiation.--Not later than October 15, 2015, and 
        October 15, 2018, the Commission shall publish in the Federal 
        Register and on a publicly available Internet website of the 
        Commission a notice requesting members of the public to submit 
        to the Commission during the 60-day period beginning on the 
        date of such publication--
                    (A) proposed duty suspensions and reductions; and
                    (B) Commission disclosure forms with respect to 
                such duty suspensions and reductions.
            (2) Review.--
