date on which the regulations required under section 113A(b) of the 
Financial Stability Act of 2010, as added by section 201(b) of this 
Act, are issued.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this title shall be construed 
to prohibit the Financial Stability Oversight Council established under 
section 111 of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5321) or 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System from complying 
with any of the requirements of section 113A of that Act, as added by

        and ``bank holding company'' have the meanings given those

        U.S.C. 1813).
            (2) Nonbank financial company.--The term ``nonbank 
        financial company'' has the meaning given that term in section 
        102(a) of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5311).
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
appropriate Federal banking agencies should seek to properly tailor 
prudential regulations and, in doing so, differentiate among bank 
holding companies and among nonbank financial companies supervised by 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System based on their 
capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities 
(including the financial activities of their subsidiaries), size, and 
other risk-related factors, using existing authorities, including 
waiver authorities provided in statute or regulation.

SEC. 205. PRESERVATION OF AUTHORITY.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the supervisory, 
regulatory, or enforcement authority of a Federal banking agency (as 
defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1813)) to further the safe and sound operation of an institution that 
the Federal banking agency supervises, except as specifically provided 
in this Act.

SEC. 706. MANDATORY RISK SHARING.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) at the direction of the Agency, the enterprises have 
        executed a series of transactions in which the enterprises 
        share credit risk with the private sector;
            (2) in the risk-sharing transactions to date, the 
        enterprises have shared credit risk on pools of residential 
        mortgage loans that back securities on which an enterprise 
        either already guarantees or does not yet guarantee the timely 
        payment of principal and interest;
            (3) the risk that the enterprises have shared has been 
        either any loss suffered on the loans in the pool or any loss 
        in excess of some minimal level on loans in the pool;
            (4) to date, the vast majority of risk-sharing transactions 
        have involved either back-end risk sharing or the transfer of 
        the second loss position; and
            (5) the Agency should direct the enterprises to--
                    (A) engage in more front-end risk sharing in which 
                the first loss position is transferred; and
                    (B) retain data that can help inform policymakers 
                and the public about the impact to consumers, the 
                market, and the enterprises from such transactions.
    (b) Mandatory Risk Sharing.--
            (1) In general.--Subpart A of part 2 of subtitle A of the 
        Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act 
        of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 4541 et seq.) is amended by adding at the 
        end the following:

        interest with the private sector before the enterprise provides 
        any such guarantee.
            ``(3) Risk-sharing transaction.--The term `risk-sharing 
        transaction' means any transaction that provides for an

        interest with the private sector.
    ``(b) Risk-sharing Transactions.--The Director shall require each 
enterprise to develop and undertake risk-sharing transactions in which 
the first loss position is transferred, as provided in subsection (c).
