   To amend section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 to require that annual State report cards reflect 
      the same race groups as the decennial census of population.

SEC. 2. DISAGGREGATION OF INFORMATION ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN ANNUAL 
              STATE REPORT CARDS.

    Section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(h)(1)(C)(i)) is amended to read as follows:
                            ``(i) information, in the aggregate and 
                        disaggregated by the same major race groups as 
                        the decennial census of the population, 
                        ethnicity, gender, disability status, migrant 
                        status, English proficiency, and status as 
                        economically disadvantaged, and cross-tabulated 
                        across all of such subgroups by gender, by 
                        disability, and by English proficiency, on 
                        student achievement at each proficiency level 
                        on the State academic assessments described in 
                        subsection (b)(3), except that such 
                        disaggregation and cross-tabulation shall not 
                        be required in a case in which the number of 
                        students in a subgroup is insufficient to yield 
                        statistically reliable information or the 
                        results would reveal personally identifiable 
                        information about an individual student;''.
