                project'' means a project or activity the primary 
                purpose of which is to reduce the level of lead in 
                water for human consumption by--
                            (i) replacement of publicly owned portions

                    (B) Limitation.--The term ``lead reduction 
                project'' does not include a partial lead service line 
                replacement if, at the conclusion of that service line 
                replacement, drinking water is delivered to a household

                service line.
            (3) Low-income.--The term ``low-income'', with respect to 
        an individual provided assistance under this section, has such 
        meaning as may be given the term by the head of the

        grant program to provide assistance to eligible entities for 
        lead reduction projects in the United States.
            (2) Evaluation.--In providing assistance under this 
        section, the Administrator shall evaluate--

                has identified the source of lead in water for human 
                consumption; and
                    (B) the means by which the proposed lead reduction 
                project would reduce lead levels in the applicable 
                water system.
            (3) Priority application.--In providing grants under this 
        subsection, the Administrator shall give priority to an

                public water system or nontransient noncommunity water 
                system that has exceeded the lead action level 
                established by the Administrator at any time during the 
                3-year period preceding the date of submission of the 
                application of the eligible entity;
                    (B) addresses lead levels in water for human 
                consumption at a school, daycare, or other facility 
                that primarily serves children or another vulnerable 
                human subpopulation; or
                    (C) addresses such priority criteria as the 
                Administrator may establish, consistent with the goal 
                of reducing lead levels of concern.
            (4) Cost sharing.--
                    (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the 
                non-Federal share of the total cost of a project funded

                20 percent.
                    (B) Waiver.--The Administrator may reduce or 
                eliminate the non-Federal share under subparagraph (A) 
                for reasons of affordability, as the Administrator 
                determines to be appropriate.
            (5) Low-income assistance.--
                    (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), an 
                eligible entity may use a grant provided under this 
                subsection to provide assistance to low-income 
                homeowners to carry out lead reduction projects.
                    (B) Limitation.--The amount of a grant provided to 
                a low-income homeowner under this paragraph shall not 
                exceed the cost of replacement of the privately owned 
                portion of the service line.
            (6) Special consideration for lead service line 
        replacement.--In carrying out lead service line replacement

                        low-income, to replace the privately owned 
                        portion of the lead service line at the cost of

                        to replace the privately owned portion of the 
                        lead service line and any pipes, fittings, and 
                        fixtures that contain lead at a cost that is 
                        equal to the difference between--
                                    (I) the cost of replacement; and

                that is funded by a grant made under this subsection 
                will not be carried out unless the customer consents to

        Subtitle E--Sustainable Water Infrastructure Investment

SEC. 1501. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Our Nation's water and wastewater systems are among the 
        best in the world, providing safe drinking water and sanitation 
        to our citizens.
            (2) In addition to protecting the health of our citizens, 
        community water systems are essential to our local economies, 
        enabling industries to achieve growth and productivity that 
        make America strong and prosperous.
            (3) Regulated under title XIV of the Public Health Service 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.; commonly known as the ``Safe 
        Drinking Water Act'') and the Federal Water Pollution Control 
        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), community drinking water systems 
        and wastewater collection and treatment facilities are critical 
        elements in the Nation's infrastructure.
            (4) Water and wastewater infrastructure is comprised of a 
        mixture of old and new technology. In many local communities 
        across the Nation, the old infrastructure has deteriorated to 
        critical conditions and is very costly to replace. Recent 
        government studies have estimated costs of $500,000,000,000 to 
        $800,000,000,000 over the next 20 years for maintaining and 
        improving the existing inventory, building new infrastructure, 
        and meeting new water quality standards.
            (5) The historical approach of funding infrastructure is 
        insufficient to meet the investment needs of the future.
            (6) The Federal partnership with State and local 
        communities has played a pivotal role in improving the Nation's 
        water quality and drinking water supplies. Federal assistance 
        under this partnership has been the linchpin of these 
        improvements.
            (7) In light of constrained Federal budgets, the 
        availability of exempt-facility financing represents an 
        important financing tool to help close the gap between funds 
        currently being invested and water infrastructure needs, 
        preserving the Federal partnership.
            (8) Providing alternative financing solutions, such as tax-
        exempt securities, encourages investment in water and 
        wastewater infrastructure that in turn creates local jobs and 
        protects the health of our citizens.
            (9) Federally mandated State volume cap restrictions in 
        conjunction with other priorities have limited the use of tax-
        exempt securities on water and wastewater infrastructure 
        investment.
            (10) Removal of State volume caps for water and wastewater 
        infrastructure will accelerate and increase overall investment 
        in the Nation's critical water infrastructure; facilitate 
        increased use of innovative infrastructure delivery methods 
        supporting sustainable water systems through public-private 
        partnerships that optimize design, financing, construction, and 
        long-term management, maintenance and viability; and provide 
        for more effective risk management of complex water 
        infrastructure projects by municipal utility and private sector 
        partners.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to provide 
alternative financing for long-term infrastructure capital investment 
programs, and to restore the Nation's safe drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure capability and protect the health of our 
citizens.

after ``(2),''.
    (b) Conforming Change.--Paragraphs (2) and (3)(B) of section 146(k) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are both amended by striking 
``(4), (5), (6),'' and inserting ``(6)''.

          TITLE III--BUILDING HEALTHIER HOMES AND COMMUNITIES

                Subtitle A--Home Lead Safety Tax Credit

SEC. 3101. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) Lead is a metal that can produce a wide range of health 
        effects in humans when ingested. Children are more vulnerable 
        to lead poisoning than adults.
            (2) Lead poisoning is a serious, entirely preventable 
        threat to a child's intelligence, behavior, and learning. In 
        severe cases, lead poisoning can result in death.
            (3) According to the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development, approximately 23 million housing units nationwide 
        have at least one lead paint hazard.
            (4) In fiscal year 2015, funding for Federal lead abatement 
        programs, such as the Lead Hazard Control Grant Program, only 
        provided for lead abatement or ``interim control measures'' for 
        18,600 homes.
            (5) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramatically reduced by 
        the abatement or complete removal of all lead-based hazards. 
        Empirical studies also have shown substantial reductions in 
        lead poisoning when the affected properties have undergone 
        ``interim control measures'' that are less costly than 
        abatement.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to encourage the safe 
removal of lead hazards from homes and thereby decrease the number of 
children who suffer reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, 
behavioral problems, and other health consequences due to lead 
poisoning.

SEC. 3102. HOME LEAD HAZARD REDUCTION ACTIVITY TAX CREDIT.

    (a) In General.--Subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after

SEC. 3201. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Poor housing conditions contribute to a wide range of 
        health conditions, including unintentional injuries, 
        respiratory illness, asthma, and cancer, which 
        disproportionately impact susceptible and vulnerable 
        populations, such as children, the poor, minorities, and people 
        with chronic medical conditions.
            (2) Over 30 million housing units in the United States have 
        significant physical problems or elevated levels of lead, 
        radon, or other contaminants that place their occupants at risk 
        for illnesses or injuries.
            (3) The societal cost of unhealthy housing in terms of lost 
        productivity, missed school days, crime, and disability far 
        exceed the cost of improving housing conditions.
            (4) Cost-effective solutions to residential health and 
        safety hazards exist, including--
                    (A) interventions for children and adolescents with 
                asthma to reduce symptom days, improve quality of life, 
                and reduce missed school days;
                    (B) housing policies to reduce childhood lead 
                exposure; and
                    (C) the installation of safety devices such as 
                smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms to reduce 
                injuries and death from fires and malfunctioning 
                equipment.
            (5) The Federal Government must continue its leadership in 
        demonstrating and implementing projects that support the 
        national goal of substantially reducing the number of homes in 
        the United States with residential health and safety hazards.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States--
                    (A) 5,757,000 households live in homes with 
                moderate or severe physical hazards;
                    (B) 23,000,000 homes have significant lead-based 
                paint hazards;
                    (C) 6,000,000 homes have had signs of mice in the 
                last 3 months; and
                    (D) 1 in 15 homes have dangerous levels of radon.
            (2) Residents of housing that is poorly designed, 
        constructed, or maintained are at risk for cancer, carbon 
        monoxide poisoning, burns, falls, rodent bites, childhood lead 
        poisoning, asthma, and other illnesses and injuries. Vulnerable 
        subpopulations, such as children and the elderly, are at 
        elevated risk for housing-related illnesses and injuries.
            (3) Because substandard housing typically poses the 
        greatest risks, the disparities in the distribution of housing-
        related health hazards are striking. One million two hundred 
        thousand housing units with significant lead-based paint 
        hazards house low-income families with children under 6 years 
        of age.
            (4) Housing-related illnesses, including asthma and lead 
        poisoning, disproportionately affect children from lower-income 
        families and from specific racial and ethnic groups. The 
        prevalence of being diagnosed with asthma in a lifetime is 24 
        percent among Puerto Rican children, 10.1 percent for Mexican-
        American children, 12.4 percent for non-Hispanic White 
        children, and 21.8 percent for non-Hispanic Black children. 
        Black children are twice as likely to die from residential 
        injuries as White children, and 3 percent of Black children and 
        2 percent of Mexican-American children have elevated blood lead 
        levels, as compared to only 1.3 percent of White children.
            (5) The annual costs for environmentally attributable 
        childhood diseases in the United States, including lead 
        poisoning, asthma, and cancer, total $76,000,000,000 in 2008 
        dollars. This amount is approximately 3.5 percent of total 
        health care costs.
            (6) Appropriate housing design, construction, and 
        maintenance, timely correction of deficiencies, planning 
        efforts, and low-cost preventive measures can reduce the 
        incidence of serious injury or death, improve the ability of 
        residents to survive in the event of a major catastrophe, and 
        contribute to overall well-being and mental health. Lead hazard 
        control in homes with lead-based paint hazards can reduce 
        children's blood lead levels by as much as 34 percent. Properly 
        installed and maintained smoke alarms reduce the risk of fire 
        deaths by 50 percent.
            (7) Providing healthy housing to families and individuals 
        in the United States will help prevent an estimated 250,000 
        children from having elevated blood lead levels, 18,000 injury 
        deaths, 12,000,000 nonfatal injuries, 3,000 deaths in house 
        fires, 9,600 emergency department visits for carbon monoxide 
        exposure, and 21,000 radon-associated lung cancer deaths that 
        occur in United States housing each year, as well as 12,300,000 
        asthma attacks, and 14,000,000 missed school days.
            (8) While there are many programs in place to address 
        housing-related health hazards, these programs are fragmented 
        and spread across many agencies, making it difficult for at-
        risk families and individuals to access assistance or to 
        receive comprehensive information.
            (9) Better coordination among Federal agencies is needed, 
        as is better coordination at State and local levels, to ensure 
        that families and individuals can access government programs 
        and services in an effective and efficient manner.

        funding for lead hazard control activities in housing receiving 
        Federal assistance meet the current and evolving needs, and if 
        not, the merits of identifying and providing dedicated funds 
        within new or existing Federal programs to conduct lead hazard 
        control activities;
            (2) evaluate the financial and social cost of lead-based 
        paint hazard prevention and lead hazard control activities, and 
        provide recommendations on how to improve coordination and 
        leveraging of public and private funds, including private 
        investments and tax incentives, to reduce the cost associated 
        with the identification and remediation of lead hazards and 
        expedite home remediation;
            (3) identify existing partnerships with public housing 
        agencies and public health agencies in addressing lead-based 
        paint hazards, what gaps exist in compliance and enforcement, 
        and whether the partnerships can be replicated and enhanced 
        with dedicated funding and better data collection and 
        dissemination among stakeholders; and
            (4) examine the appropriateness and efficacy of existing 
        Department protocols on reducing or abating lead-based paint 
        hazards and whether they are aligned with specific 
        environmental health scenarios to ensure the best and 
        appropriate health outcomes and reduce further exposure.

 TITLE VI--DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR LEAD CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER

SEC. 6101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the American Water Works Association, 
        approximately 6,100,000 homes are served by lead service lines.
            (2) According to the most recent Environmental Protection 
        Agency Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and 
        Assessment, $384,000,000,000 is needed for drinking water 
        infrastructure by 2030.
            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control--
                    (A) there is no safe level of lead in children;
                    (B) children tend to show signs of severe lead 
                toxicity at lower levels than adults;
                    (C) lead can damage a developing baby's nervous 
                system and even low-level lead exposures in developing 
                babies have been found to affect behavior and 
                intelligence;
                    (D) lead exposure can cause miscarriage, 
                stillbirths, and infertility (in both men and women); 
                and
                    (E) people with prolonged exposure to lead may also 
                be at risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, 
                kidney disease, and reduced fertility.
            (4) In Flint, Michigan, homes were found to have lead 
        levels as high as 4,000 parts per billion, nearly 267 times the 
        Environmental Protection Agency's action level for lead in 
        drinking water of 15 parts per billion.
            (5) Numerous cities around the United States, including 
        Sebring, Ohio, Durham, North Carolina, Greenville, North 
        Carolina, and Jackson, Mississippi, have experienced elevated 
        levels of lead in drinking water.
