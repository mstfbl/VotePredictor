  To provide special rules for the use of retirement funds for relief 
         relating to severe flooding in the Mississippi Delta.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Emergency Tax Relief Act of 
2016 (FLETRA)''.

SEC. 2. SPECIAL RULES FOR USE OF RETIREMENT FUNDS WITH RESPECT TO 
              MISSISSIPPI DELTA AREAS DAMAGED BY 2016 FLOODING.

    (a) Tax-Favored Withdrawals From Retirement Plans.--
            (1) In general.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        of 1986 shall not apply to any qualified Mississippi River 
        Delta flooding distribution.
            (2) Aggregate dollar limitation.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of this subsection, 
                the aggregate amount of distributions received by an 
                individual which may be treated as qualified 
                Mississippi River Delta flooding distributions for any 
                taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of--
                            (i) $100,000, over
                            (ii) the aggregate amounts treated as 
                        qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding 
                        distributions received by such individual for 
                        all prior taxable years.
                    (B) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a 
                distribution to an individual would (without regard to 
                subparagraph (A)) be a qualified Mississippi River 
                Delta flooding distribution, a plan shall not be 
                treated as violating any requirement of this title 
                merely because the plan treats such distribution as a 
                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding 
                distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such 
                distributions from all plans maintained by the employer 
                (and any member of any controlled group which includes 
                the employer) to such individual exceeds $100,000.
                    (C) Controlled group.--For purposes of subparagraph 
                (B), the term ``controlled group'' means any group 
                treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), 
                (m), or (o) of section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code 
                of 1986.
            (3) Amount distributed may be repaid.--
                    (A) In general.--Any individual who receives a 
                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution 
                may, at any time during the 3-year period beginning on 
                the day after the date on which such distribution was 
                received, make one or more contributions in an 
                aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such 
                distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which 
                such individual is a beneficiary and to which a 
                rollover contribution of such distribution could be 
                made under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 
                408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the Internal Revenue Code 
                of 1986, as the case may be.
                    (B) Treatment of repayments of distributions from 
                eligible retirement plans other than iras.--For 
                purposes of this title, if a contribution is made 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a 
                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution 
                from an eligible retirement plan other than an 
                individual retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to 
                the extent of the amount of the contribution, be 
                treated as having received the qualified Mississippi 
                River Delta flooding distribution in an eligible 
                rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) 
                of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and as having 
                transferred the amount to the eligible retirement plan 
                in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days 
                of the distribution.
                    (C) Treatment of repayments for distributions from 
                iras.--For purposes of this title, if a contribution is 
                made pursuant to subparagraph (A) with respect to a 
                qualified Mississippi River Delta flooding distribution 
                from an individual retirement plan (as defined by 
                section 7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
                1986), then, to the extent of the amount of the 
                contribution, the qualified Mississippi River Delta 
                flooding distribution shall be treated as a 
                distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of such 
                Code and as having been transferred to the eligible 
                retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer 
                within 60 days of the distribution.
            (4) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
