                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of 
  Health and Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the 
Health Resources and Services Administration, to make grants to States 
          for screening and treatment for maternal depression.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Postpartum Depression Out 
of the Shadows Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Depression is a medical, physiologic illness, and not a 
        sign of weakness or poor parenting.
            (2) Maternal depression includes major and minor depressive 
        episodes that occur during pregnancy or in the first 12 months 
        after delivery.
            (3) An estimated 9 to 16 percent of new mothers experience 
        postpartum depression.
            (4) Every year, more than 400,000 infants are born to 
        mothers who have depression, which makes perinatal depression 
        the most underdiagnosed obstetric complication in the United 
        States.
            (5) The consequences of maternal depression include poor 
        bonding between mother and infant, which may have negative 
        effects on cognitive development, social-emotional development, 
        and behavior of the child.
            (6) Maternal suicide exceeds hemorrhage and hypertensive 
        disorders as a cause of maternal mortality.
            (7) About 90 percent of women who have maternal depression 
        can be treated successfully with a combination of medication 
        and counseling.
            (8) States and professional organizations are taking the 
        lead in addressing this problem, through public awareness 
        campaigns, resource collection, and even promoting phone 
        consultations.
            (9) Congress should provide resources to support State 
        teams, and help them find innovative solutions to this problem.

SEC. 3. SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION.

    The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 
317L of such Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-13) the following:

                to aid in the treatment of pregnant and postpartum 
                women;
