    (b) Findings and Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) energy costs for homeowners are a significant 
                and increasing portion of their household budgets;
                    (B) household energy use can vary substantially 
                depending on the efficiency and characteristics of the 
                house;
                    (C) expected energy cost savings are important to 
                the value of the house;
                    (D) the current test for loan affordability used by 
                most covered agencies, commonly known as the ``debt-to-
                income'' test, is inadequate because it does not take 
                into account the expected energy cost savings for the 
                homeowner of an energy efficient home; and
                    (E) another loan limitation, commonly known as the 
                ``loan-to-value'' test, is tied to the appraisal, which 
                often does not adjust for efficiency features of 
                houses.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--
                    (A) improve the accuracy of mortgage underwriting 
                by Federal mortgage agencies by ensuring that energy 
                cost savings are included in the underwriting process 
                as described below, and thus to reduce the amount of 
                energy consumed by homes and to facilitate the creation 
                of energy efficiency retrofit and construction jobs;
                    (B) require a covered agency to include the 
                expected energy cost savings of a homeowner as a 
                regular expense in the tests, such as the debt-to-
                income test, used to determine the ability of the loan 
                applicant to afford the cost of homeownership for all 
                loan programs; and
                    (C) require a covered agency to include the value 
                home buyers place on the energy efficiency of a house 
                in tests used to compare the mortgage amount to home 
                value, taking precautions to avoid double-counting and 
                to support safe and sound lending.
    (c) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Criteria.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, in consultation 
        with the advisory group established in subsection (f)(2), 
        develop and issue guidelines for a covered agency to implement 
        enhanced loan eligibility requirements, for use when testing 
        the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered loan, that 
        account for the expected energy cost savings for a loan 
        applicant at a subject property, in the manner set forth in 
        paragraphs (2) and (3).
            (2) Requirements to account for energy cost savings.--The 
        enhanced loan eligibility requirements under paragraph (1) 
        shall require that, for all covered loans for which an energy 
        efficiency report is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee by 
        the mortgagor, the covered agency and the mortgagee shall take 
        into consideration the estimated energy cost savings expected 
        for the owner of the subject property in determining whether 
        the loan applicant has sufficient income to service the 
        mortgage debt plus other regular expenses. To the extent that a 
        covered agency uses a test such as a debt-to-income test that 
        includes certain regular expenses, such as hazard insurance and 
        property taxes, the expected energy cost savings shall be 
        included as an offset to these expenses. Energy costs to be 
        assessed include the cost of electricity, natural gas, oil, and 
        any other fuel regularly used to supply energy to the subject 
        property.
            (3) Determination of estimated energy cost savings.--
                    (A) In general.--The guidelines to be issued under 
                paragraph (1) shall include instructions for the 
                covered agency to calculate estimated energy cost 
                savings using--
                            (i) the energy efficiency report;
                            (ii) an estimate of baseline average energy 
                        costs; and
                            (iii) additional sources of information as 
                        determined by the Secretary.
                    (B) Report requirements.--For the purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), an energy efficiency report shall--
                            (i) estimate the expected energy cost 
                        savings specific to the subject property, based 
                        on specific information about the property;
                            (ii) be prepared in accordance with the 
                        guidelines to be issued under paragraph (1); 
                        and
                            (iii) be prepared--
                                    (I) in accordance with the 
                                Residential Energy Service Network's 
                                Home Energy Rating System (commonly 
                                known as ``HERS'') by an individual 
                                certified by the Residential Energy 
                                Service Network, unless the Secretary 
                                finds that the use of HERS does not 
                                further the purposes of this section; 
                                or
                                    (II) by other methods approved by 
                                the Secretary, in consultation with the 
                                Secretary of Energy and the advisory 
                                group established in subsection (f)(2), 
                                for use under this section, which shall 
                                include a third-party quality assurance 
                                procedure.
                    (C) Use by appraiser.--If an energy efficiency 
                report is used under paragraph (2), the energy 
                efficiency report shall be provided to the appraiser to 
                estimate the energy efficiency of the subject property 
                and for potential adjustments for energy efficiency.
            (4) Required disclosure to consumer for a home with an 
        energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is 
        used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued under 
        paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to--
                    (A) inform the loan applicant of the expected 
                energy costs as estimated in the energy efficiency 
                report, in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the 
                Secretary, and if practicable, in the documents 
                delivered at the time of loan application; and
                    (B) include the energy efficiency report in the 
                documentation for the loan provided to the borrower.
            (5) Required disclosure to consumer for a home without an 
        energy efficiency report.--If an energy efficiency report is 
        not used under paragraph (2), the guidelines to be issued under 
        paragraph (1) shall require the mortgagee to inform the loan 
        applicant in a manner and at a time as prescribed by the 
        Secretary, and if practicable, in the documents delivered at 
        the time of loan application of--
                    (A) typical energy cost savings that would be 
                possible from a cost-effective energy upgrade of a home 
                of the size and in the region of the subject property;
                    (B) the impact the typical energy cost savings 
                would have on monthly ownership costs of a typical 
                home;
                    (C) the impact on the size of a mortgage that could 
                be obtained if the typical energy cost savings were 
                reflected in an energy efficiency report; and
                    (D) resources for improving the energy efficiency 
                of a home.
            (6) Pricing of loans.--
                    (A) In general.--A covered agency may price covered 
                loans originated under the enhanced loan eligibility 
                requirements required under this section in accordance 
                with the estimated risk of the loans.
                    (B) Imposition of certain material costs, 
                impediments, or penalties.--In the absence of a 
                publicly disclosed analysis that demonstrates 
                significant additional default risk or prepayment risk 
                associated with the loans, a covered agency shall not 
                impose material costs, impediments, or penalties on 
                covered loans merely because the loan uses an energy 
                efficiency report or the enhanced loan eligibility 
                requirements required under this section.
            (7) Limitations.--
                    (A) In general.--A covered agency may price covered 
                loans originated under the enhanced loan eligibility 
                requirements required under this section in accordance 
                with the estimated risk of those loans.
                    (B) Prohibited actions.--A covered agency shall 
                not--
                            (i) modify existing underwriting criteria 
                        or adopt new underwriting criteria that 
                        intentionally negate or reduce the impact of 
                        the requirements or resulting benefits that are 
                        set forth or otherwise derived from the 
                        enhanced loan eligibility requirements required 
                        under this subsection; or
                            (ii) impose greater buy back requirements, 
                        credit overlays, or insurance requirements, 
                        including private mortgage insurance, on 
                        covered loans merely because the loan uses an 
                        energy efficiency report or the enhanced loan 
                        eligibility requirements required under this 
                        subsection.
            (8) Applicability and implementation date.--Not later than 
        3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and before 
        December 31, 2017, the enhanced loan eligibility requirements 
        required under this subsection shall be implemented by each 
        covered agency to--
                    (A) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or 
                refinancing of any loan for the sale, of any home;
                    (B) be available on any residential real property 
                (including individual units of condominiums and 
                cooperatives) that qualifies for a covered loan; and
                    (C) provide prospective mortgagees with sufficient 
                guidance and applicable tools to implement the required 
                underwriting methods.
    (d) Enhanced Energy Efficiency Underwriting Valuation Guidelines.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) in consultation with the Federal Financial 
                Institutions Examination Council and the advisory group 
                established in subsection (f)(2), develop and issue 
                guidelines for a covered agency to determine the 
                maximum permitted loan amount based on the value of the 
                property for all covered loans made on properties with 
                an energy efficiency report that meets the requirements 
                of subsection (c)(3)(B); and
                    (B) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, 
                issue guidelines for a covered agency to determine the 
                estimated energy savings under paragraph (3) for 
                properties with an energy efficiency report.
            (2) Requirements.--The enhanced energy efficiency 
        underwriting valuation guidelines required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include--
                    (A) a requirement that if an energy efficiency 
                report that meets the requirements of subsection 
                (c)(3)(B) is voluntarily provided to the mortgagee, 
                such report shall be used by the mortgagee or covered 
                agency to determine the estimated energy savings of the 
                subject property; and
                    (B) a requirement that the estimated energy savings 
                of the subject property be added to the appraised value 
                of the subject property by a mortgagee or covered 
                agency for the purpose of determining the loan-to-value 
                ratio of the subject property, unless the appraisal 
                includes the value of the overall energy efficiency of 
                the subject property, using methods to be established 
                under the guidelines issued under paragraph (1).
            (3) Determination of estimated energy savings.--
                    (A) Amount of energy savings.--The amount of 
                estimated energy savings shall be determined by 
                calculating the difference between the estimated energy 
                costs for the average comparable houses, as determined 
                in guidelines to be issued under paragraph (1), and the 
                estimated energy costs for the subject property based 
                upon the energy efficiency report.
                    (B) Duration of energy savings.--The duration of 
                the estimated energy savings shall be based upon the 
                estimated life of the applicable equipment, consistent 
                with the rating system used to produce the energy 
                efficiency report.
                    (C) Present value of energy savings.--The present 
                value of the future savings shall be discounted using 
                the average interest rate on conventional 30-year 
                mortgages, in the manner directed by guidelines issued 
                under paragraph (1).
            (4) Ensuring consideration of energy efficient features.--
        Section 1110 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, 
        and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3339) is amended--
                    (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``; and'' and 
                inserting a semicolon; and
                    (B) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``; and'' and inserting after 
                paragraph (3) the following:
            ``(4) that State certified and licensed appraisers have 
        timely access, whenever practicable, to information from the 
        property owner and the lender that may be relevant in 
        developing an opinion of value regarding the energy- and water-
        saving improvements or features of a property, such as--
                    ``(A) labels or ratings of buildings;
                    ``(B) installed appliances, measures, systems or 
                technologies;
                    ``(C) blueprints;
                    ``(D) construction costs;
                    ``(E) financial or other incentives regarding 
                energy- and water-efficient components and systems 
                installed in a property;

                of energy and water efficiency performance of a 
                property, observing all financial privacy requirements 
                adhered to by certified and licensed appraisers, 
                including section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 
                U.S.C. 6801).
        Unless a property owner consents to a lender, an appraiser, in 
        carrying out the requirements of paragraph (4), shall not have 
        access to the commercial or financial information of the owner 
        that is privileged or confidential.''.
            (5) Transactions requiring state certified appraisers.--
        Section 1113 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, 
        and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3342) is amended--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting before the 
                semicolon the following: ``, or any real property on 
                which the appraiser makes adjustments using an energy 
                efficiency report''; and
                    (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting after 
                ``atypical'' the following: ``, or an appraisal on 
                which the appraiser makes adjustments using an energy 
                efficiency report.''.
            (6) Protections.--
                    (A) Authority to impose limitations.--The 
                guidelines to be issued under paragraph (1) shall 
                include such limitations and conditions as determined 
                by the Secretary to be necessary to protect against 
                meaningful under or over valuation of energy cost 
                savings or duplicative counting of energy efficiency 
                features or energy cost savings in the valuation of any 
                subject property that is used to determine a loan 
                amount.
                    (B) Additional authority.--At the end of the 7-year 
                period following the implementation of enhanced 
                eligibility and underwriting valuation requirements 
                under this section, the Secretary may modify or apply 
                additional exceptions to the approach described in 
                paragraph (2), where the Secretary finds that the 
                unadjusted appraisal will reflect an accurate market 
                value of the efficiency of the subject property or that 
                a modified approach will better reflect an accurate 
                market value.
            (7) Applicability and implementation date.--Not later than 
        3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, and before 
        December 31, 2017, each covered agency shall implement the 
        guidelines required under this subsection, which shall--
                    (A) apply to any covered loan for the sale, or 
                refinancing of any loan for the sale, of any home; and
                    (B) be available on any residential real property, 
                including individual units of condominiums and 
                cooperatives, that qualifies for a covered loan.
    (e) Monitoring.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which the 
enhanced eligibility and underwriting valuation requirements are 
implemented under this section, and every year thereafter, each covered 
agency with relevant activity shall issue and make available to the 
public a report that--
            (1) enumerates the number of covered loans of the agency 
        for which there was an energy efficiency report, and that used 
        energy efficiency appraisal guidelines and enhanced loan 
        eligibility requirements;
            (2) includes the default rates and rates of foreclosures 
        for each category of loans; and
            (3) describes the risk premium, if any, that the agency has 
        priced into covered loans for which there was an energy 
        efficiency report.
    (f) Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations 
        to carry out this section, in consultation with the Secretary 
        of Energy and the advisory group established in paragraph (2), 
        which may contain such classifications, differentiations, or 
        other provisions, and may provide for such proper 
        implementation and appropriate treatment of different types of 
        transactions, as the Secretary determines are necessary or 
        proper to effectuate the purposes of this section, to prevent 
        circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance 
        therewith.
            (2) Advisory group.--To assist in carrying out this 
        section, the Secretary shall establish an advisory group, 
        consisting of individuals representing the interests of--
                    (A) mortgage lenders;
                    (B) appraisers;
                    (C) energy raters and residential energy 
                consumption experts;
                    (D) energy efficiency organizations;
                    (E) real estate agents;
                    (F) home builders and remodelers;

        water and locational efficiency experts, to advise the 
        Secretary on the implementation of the enhanced energy 
        efficiency underwriting criteria established in subsections (c) 
        and (d).
            (2) Recommendations.--The advisory group established in 
        subsection (f)(2) shall provide recommendations to the 
        Secretary on any revisions or additions to the enhanced energy 
        efficiency underwriting criteria deemed necessary by the group, 
        which may include alternate methods to better account for home 
        energy costs and additional factors to account for substantial 
        and regular costs of homeownership such as location-based
