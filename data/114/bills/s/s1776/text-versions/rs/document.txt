        <DELETED>    (1) in many States, the Native American population 
        is disproportionately represented in fatalities and crash 
        statistics;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) improved crash reporting by tribal law 
        enforcement agencies would facilitate safety planning and would

        Federal funds for safety improvements;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) the causes of underreporting of crashes on 
        Indian reservations include--</DELETED>

                reporting forms and protocols; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) without more accurate reporting of crashes on 
        Indian reservations, it is difficult or impossible to fully

    Section 202(a)(6) of title 23, United States Code, is amended by 
striking ``6 percent'' and inserting ``5 percent for each fiscal 
year''.

SEC. 6. OPTION OF ASSUMING NEPA APPROVAL AUTHORITY.

    (a) Definition of Secretary.--In this section, the term 
``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of 
Transportation, as applicable.
    (b) Assumption of Federal Responsibilities.--An Indian tribe 
participating in tribal self-governance or a contract or agreement 
under subsection (a)(2) or (b)(7) of section 202 of title 23, United 
States Code, and carrying out construction projects on the Indian 
reservation over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction, may elect to 
assume all Federal responsibilities under the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), division A of subtitle III 
of title 54, United States Code, and other applicable Federal law that 
would apply if the Secretary were to undertake a construction project 
if the Indian tribe--
            (1) designates an officer--
                    (A) to represent the Indian tribe; and
                    (B) to assume the status of a responsible Federal 
                official under those laws; and

SEC. 7. TRIBAL GOVERNMENT TRANSPORTATION SAFETY DATA REPORT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in many States, the Native American population is 
        disproportionately represented in fatalities and crash 
        statistics;
            (2) improved crash reporting by tribal law enforcement 
        agencies would facilitate safety planning and would enable 
        Indian tribes to apply more successfully for State and Federal 
        funds for safety improvements;
            (3) the causes of underreporting of crashes on Indian 
        reservations include--
                    (A) tribal law enforcement capacity, including--
                            (i) staffing shortages and turnover; and
                            (ii) lack of equipment, software, and 
                        training; and
                    (B) lack of standardization in crash reporting 
                forms and protocols; and
            (4) without more accurate reporting of crashes on Indian 
        reservations and rural roads located in or around Alaska Native 
        villages and within the boundaries of Regional Corporations 
        (within the meaning of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 
        (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)), it is difficult or impossible to 
        fully understand the nature of the problem and develop 
        appropriate countermeasures, which may include effective 
        transportation safety planning and programs aimed at--
                    (A) DUI prevention;
                    (B) pedestrian safety;
                    (C) roadway safety improvements;
                    (D) seat belt usage; and
                    (E) proper use of child restraints.
    (b) Report to Congress.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary, after consultation with 
        the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services, the Attorney General, and Indian tribes, shall 
        submit to the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives 
        a report describing the quality of transportation safety data 
        collected by States and counties for transportation safety 
        systems and the relevance of that data to improving the 
        collection and sharing of data on crashes on or near--
                    (A) Indian reservations; or
                    (B) rural roads located in or around Alaska Native 
                villages and within the boundaries of Regional 
                Corporations (within the meaning of the Alaska Native 
                Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)).
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of the report described in 
        paragraph (1) are--
                    (A) to improve the collection and sharing of data 
                on crashes on or near Indian reservations; and
                    (B) to develop data that Indian tribes can use to 
                recover damages to tribal property caused by motorists.
            (3) Paperless data reporting.--In preparing the report 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide Indian tribes 
        with options and best practices for transition to a paperless 
        transportation safety data reporting system that--
                    (A) improves the collection of crash reports;
                    (B) stores, archives, queries, and shares crash 
                records; and
                    (C) uses data exclusively--
                            (i) to address traffic safety issues on--
                                    (I) Indian reservations; and
                                    (II) rural roads located in or 
                                around Alaska Native villages and 
                                within the boundaries of Regional 
                                Corporations (within the meaning of the 
                                Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
                                U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)); and
                            (ii) to identify and improve problem areas 
                        on--
                                    (I) public roads on Indian 
                                reservations; and
                                    (II) rural roads located in or 
                                around Alaska Native villages and 
                                within the boundaries of Regional 
                                Corporations (within the meaning of the 
                                Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
                                U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)).
            (4) Additional budgetary resources.--The Secretary shall 
        include in the report under paragraph (1) the identification of 
        Federal transportation funds provided to Indian tribes by 
        agencies in addition to the Department of the Interior.
