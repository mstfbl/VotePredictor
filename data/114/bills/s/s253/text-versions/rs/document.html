        competitive entry into the communications marketplace or to the 
        competitive expansion of existing providers of communications 
        services;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(4) describe the agenda of the Commission for 
        the next 2-year period for addressing the challenges and

        information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(4) Considering small businesses.--In assessing 
        the state of competition under subsection (b)(1) and regulatory 
        barriers under subsection (b)(3), the Commission shall consider
