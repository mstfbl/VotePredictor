SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The people of the United States recognize and believe 
        that children should grow up in permanent, safe, and nurturing 
        families in order to develop and thrive.
            (2) Science shows that children, and particularly infants, 
        living in impersonal, socially deprived institutions may suffer 
        lasting, and in many cases, irreversible damage, including--
                    (A) reduced brain activity and brain size;
                    (B) lower intelligence quotients;
                    (C) serious behavioral and emotional problems; and
                    (D) disturbed relationships with others.
            (3) Governments in other countries seek models that promote 
        the placement of children who are living outside family care in 
        permanent, safe, and nurturing families, rather than in foster 
        care or institutions; but many governments lack the resources 
        or infrastructure to adequately address this need.
            (4) Despite the efforts of countless governments and 
        nongovernmental organizations, millions of children remain 
        uncounted and outside of the protection, nurturing care, 
        permanence, safety, and love of a family.
            (5) No reliable data currently exists to define and 
        document the number and needs of children in the world 
        currently living without families, but available evidence 
        demonstrates that there are millions of children in this 
        situation needing immediate help.
            (6) The December 2012 Action Plan for Children in Adversity 
        commits the United States Government to achieving a world in 
        which all children grow up within protective family care and 
        free from deprivation, exploitation, and danger. To effectively 
        and efficiently accomplish this goal, it is necessary to 
        realign the United States Government's current operational 
        system for assisting orphans and vulnerable children and 
        processing intercountry adoptions.
            (7) Significant resources are already dedicated to 
        international assistance for orphans and vulnerable children, 
        and a relatively small portion of these resources can be 
        reallocated to achieve more timely, effective, nurturing, and 
        permanent familial solutions for children living without 
        families, resulting in fewer children worldwide living in 
        institutions or on the streets, more families preserved or 
        reunified, and increased domestic and international adoptions.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to support the core value that families are the bedrock 
        of any society;
            (2) to protect the fundamental human right of all children 
        to grow up within the loving care of permanent, safe, and 
        nurturing families;
            (3) to address a critical gap in United States foreign 
        policy implementation by authorizing a whole-of-government 
        strategic approach to ensure coordination within and among the 
        relevant Federal agencies for international policy and 
        operational structures so that seeking permanent families for 
        children living without families receives more prominence, 
        focus, and resources (through the reallocation of existing 
        personnel and resources);
            (4) to harness the diplomatic and operational power of the 
        United States Government in the international sphere by helping 
        to identify and implement timely, permanent, safe, and 
        nurturing familial solutions for children living without 
        families through effective implementation of the three core and 
        three supporting objectives of the Action Plan on Children in 
        Adversity;
            (5) to ensure that intercountry adoption by United States 
        citizens becomes a viable and fully developed option for 
        creating permanent families for children who need them;
            (6) to protect against abuses of children; and
            (7) to harmonize and strengthen existing intercountry 
        adoption processes under United States law--
                    (A) by ensuring that the same set of procedures and 
                criteria govern suitability and eligibility 
                determinations for prospective adoptive parents seeking 
                to complete intercountry adoptions, whether or not the 
                child is from a foreign state that is a party to the 
                Hague Adoption Convention; and
                    (B) by aligning the definitions of eligible 
                children for Convention adoptions and non-Convention 
                adoptions to the maximum extent possible.

                    (B) Advocate for concurrent planning.--
                            (i) In general.--In developing policies and 
                        programs under this Act, the Ambassador-at-
                        Large shall advocate that all options for 
                        providing appropriate, protective, and 
                        permanent family care to children living 
                        without families must be considered 
                        concurrently and permanent solutions must be 
                        put in place as quickly as possible. Solutions 
                        include family preservation and reunification, 
                        kinship care, guardianship, domestic and 
                        intercountry adoption, and other culturally 
                        acceptable forms of care that will result in 
                        appropriate, protective, and permanent family 
                        care. Preference should be given to options 
                        that optimize the child's well-being, which 
                        generally means options which provide children 
                        with fully protected legal status and parents 
                        with full legal status as parents, including 
                        full parental rights and responsibilities. The 
                        principle of subsidiarity, which gives 
                        preference to in-country solutions, should be 
                        implemented within the context of a concurrent 
                        planning strategy, exploring in- and out-of-
                        country options simultaneously. If an in-
                        country placement providing appropriate, 
                        protective, and permanent care is not quickly 
                        available, and such an international home is 
                        available, encourage policies that allow the 
                        child to be placed in an international home 
                        without delay.
                            (ii) Interim placements.--Nothing in this 
                        subsection may be construed to preclude interim 
                        placements, including in kinship care, foster 
                        care, and small group homes, to temporarily 
                        improve children's living conditions in 
                        individual circumstances in which--
                                    (I) a permanent solution is not 
                                immediately available if ongoing 
                                efforts are made to move the child from 
                                interim to permanent placement as soon 
                                as possible; and
                                    (II) the child's best interests 
                                will be served.
                            (iii) Exceptions.--Exceptions to the 
                        general rule set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) 
                        may be made, as needed in individual cases, to 
                        serve the child's best interests, including the 
                        following:
                                    (I) Permanent guardianship may be 
                                preferable to adoption in certain cases 
                                where the child has developed a 
                                powerful bond to a loving guardian who 
                                prefers not to adopt because of the 
                                child's ties to birth parents who love 
                                the child, but are not in a position to 
                                provide appropriate nurturing.
                                    (II) Options generally viewed as 
                                interim solutions, such as foster care 
                                and small group homes, may be 
                                preferable to family reunification when 
                                the parents are not in a position to 
                                provide appropriate nurturing.
                                    (III) For children with 
                                disabilities, solutions to prevent 
                                institutionalization and to assist with 
                                reintegration into the community from 
                                institutions, include payment and 
                                support to families, substitute 
                                families, small group homes, or kinship 
                                care.
                    (C) Best practices.--In developing policies and 
                programs under this Act, the Ambassador-at-Large shall 
                identify and utilize evidence-based programs and best 
                practices in family preservation and reunification and 
                provision of permanent parental care through 
                guardianship, kinship care, and domestic and 
                intercountry adoption as derived from a wide variety of 
                domestic, foreign, and global policies and practices.
                    (D) Technical assistance.--The Ambassador-at-Large, 
                in consultation with other appropriate Federal 
                agencies, shall provide technical assistance to 
                governments of foreign countries to help build their 
                child welfare capacities, particularly pertaining to 
                family-based permanence. Such assistance should aim to 
                strengthen family preservation and reunification and 
                the provision of appropriate, protective, and permanent 
                family care through kinship care, guardianship, and 
                domestic and intercountry adoption, including 
                assistance with--
                            (i) the drafting, disseminating, and 
                        implementing of legislation;
                            (ii) the development of implementing 
                        systems and procedures;
                            (iii) the establishment of public, private, 
                        and faith- and community-based partnerships;
                            (iv) the development of workforce training 
                        for governmental and nongovernmental staff; and
                            (v) infrastructure development and data 
                        collection techniques necessary to identify and 
                        document the number and needs of children 
                        living without appropriate, protective, and 
                        permanent family care.
            (4) Responsibilities with respect to intercountry 
        adoption.--

                responsibility for representing the United States 
                Government in discussions, negotiations, and diplomatic 
                contacts pertaining to intercountry adoptions.
                    (B) Central authority responsibility under the 
                intercountry adoption act of 2000.--Section 101(b)(2) 
                of the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 
                14911(b)(2)) is amended by striking ``Office of 
                Children's Issues'' and inserting the ``Office of 
                Vulnerable Children and Family Security''.
                    (C) Determinations of hague adoption convention 
                compliance.--The VCFS, in consultation with other 
                offices of the Department of State, and the Department 
                of Homeland Security, shall have lead responsibility 
                for determining whether a Convention partner country 
                has met its obligations under the Hague Adoption 
                Convention and is eligible to participate in 
                intercountry adoptions in accordance with United States 
                law. Such determinations shall be documented in 
                writing, based on standardized criteria, and available 
                for public review and comment.
            (5) Policy coordination.--The Ambassador-at-Large shall 
        coordinate with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the

        living outside family care in foreign countries.
            (6) Information coordination.--The Ambassador-at-Large 
        shall transmit--
                    (A) any intercountry adoption related case 
                information received from the Central Authority of 
                another Convention country to the Secretary of Homeland 
                Security; and
