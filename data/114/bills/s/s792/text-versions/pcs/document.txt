SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO IRAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is the policy of the United States that the 
        Government of Iran will not be allowed to develop or otherwise 
        acquire a nuclear weapon capability;
            (2) all instruments of power and influence of the United 
        States should remain on the table to prevent the Government of 
        Iran from developing or otherwise acquiring a nuclear weapon 
        capability;
            (3) a long-term comprehensive solution with Iran will be 
        most sustainable over the long term if the President consults 
        and coordinates closely with Congress to implement a strategy 
        that decisively ends any nuclear threat from Iran;
            (4) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or 
        inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and 
        technologies under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
        Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 
        1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly referred 
        to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');
            (5) the goal of international negotiations with Iran, led 
        by the United States, should be to conclude a long-term 
        comprehensive solution with parameters that will--
                    (A) reverse the development of Iran's illicit 
                nuclear infrastructure, including enrichment and 
                reprocessing capabilities and facilities, the heavy 
                water reactor and production plant at Arak, and any 
                nuclear weapon components and technology, such that 
                Iran is precluded from a nuclear breakout capability 
                and prevented from pursuing both uranium and plutonium 
                pathways to a nuclear weapon;
                    (B) bring Iran into compliance with all United 
                Nations Security Council resolutions related to Iran's 
                nuclear program, including Resolutions 1696 (2006), 
                1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 
                1929 (2010), with a view toward bringing to a 
                satisfactory conclusion the Security Council's 
                consideration of matters relating to the nuclear 
                program of Iran;
                    (C) resolve all issues of past and present concern 
                with the International Atomic Energy Agency, including 
                possible military dimensions of the nuclear program of 
                Iran, and give inspectors access to personnel, 
                documents, and facilities involved, at any point, with 
                nuclear or nuclear weapons-related activities of Iran;
                    (D) permit on-site and short-notice inspection, 
                verification, and monitoring of all declared and 
                suspect facilities in Iran, including installation and 
                use of any compliance verification equipment requested 
                by the International Atomic Energy Agency, such that 
                any effort by Iran to produce a nuclear weapon will be 
                quickly detected;
                    (E) require that Iran fully implement and comply 
                with--
                            (i) the Agreement between Iran and the 
                        International Atomic Energy Agency for the 
                        Application of Safeguards in Connection with 
                        the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
                        Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, 1973 (commonly 
                        referred to as the ``Comprehensive Safeguards 
                        Agreement'');
                            (ii) modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary 
                        Arrangements to the Agreement between Iran and 
                        the International Atomic Energy Agency for the 
                        Application of Safeguards in Connection with 
                        the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
                        Weapons; and
                            (iii) ratification and implementation of 
                        the Protocol Additional to the Agreement 
                        between Iran and the International Atomic 
                        Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards 
                        in Connection with the Treaty on the Non-
                        Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at 
                        Vienna December 18, 2003 (commonly referred to 
                        as the ``Additional Protocol''); and
                    (F) require that Iran implement measures in 
                addition to the Additional Protocol that include 
                verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
                of Iran's centrifuge research, development, and 
                manufacturing facilities, including raw materials and 
                components, and Iran's uranium mines, mills, and 
                processing facilities;
            (6) the United States should continue to impose sanctions 
        on the Government of Iran and its proxies for their continuing 
        sponsorship of terrorism;
            (7) the United States should continue to impose sanctions 
        on the Government of Iran and Iranian persons for--
                    (A) ongoing abuses of human rights; and
                    (B) actions in support of the regime of Bashar al-
                Assad in Syria; and
            (8) the United States should continue to impose sanctions 
        on the Government of Iran and other governments and persons for 
        the procurement, sale, or transfer of technology, services, or 
        goods that support the development or acquisition of weapons of 
        mass destruction or the means of delivery of those weapons.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST AND 
              TO DEFEND ITSELF AND ITS PEOPLE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Consistent with Article 51 of the Charter of the United 
        Nations, which recognizes the right of a country to self-
        defense, Israel must be allowed to take any actions necessary 
        to remove threats to its existence.
            (2) Iran, which rejects Israel's right to exist as a 
        country, is a continued threat to the safety and security of 
        Israel and the United States through its support of terrorist 
        organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah.
            (3) Any efforts by Iran to acquire nuclear weapons are a 
        direct threat to Israel's right to exist as a country.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States supports Israel's rights--
            (1) to exist as a democratic, Jewish state;
            (2) to defend itself against threats to its existence; and
            (3) to protect the lives and safety of the people of 
        Israel.

                the agreement to conceal activities that violate its 
                obligations under the agreement; and
                    (B) alter or deviate from standard practices in 
                order to impede efforts to verify that Iran is 
                complying with those obligations.

        including enhanced trade and market opportunities, pursuant to 
        the agreement.
    (d) Form of Reports.--Each report under subsection (b) or (c) shall

        provided under any provision of law imposing sanctions with 
        respect to Iran, refrain from applying any such sanctions, or 
        take any other action to alter or limit the application of 
        sanctions in connection with or to implement the long-term 
        comprehensive solution, until the date that is 30 days of

        not apply to a renewal of any deferral, waiver, or other
