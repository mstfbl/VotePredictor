                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for consideration of legislation to respond to a violation 
  by Iran of an arrangement relating to its nuclear program, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Congressional Oversight Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Joint plan of action.--The term ``Joint Plan of 
        Action''--
                    (A) means the Joint Plan of Action, signed at 
                Geneva November 24, 2013, by Iran and the P5-plus-1 
                countries; and
                    (B) includes all implementing materials and 
                agreements related to the Joint Plan of Action, 
                including the technical understandings reached on 
                January 12, 2014, the extension agreed to on July 19, 
                2014, and the extension agreed to on November 24, 2014.
            (2) P5-plus-1 countries.--The term ``P5-plus-1 countries'' 
        means the United States, France, the Russian Federation, the 
        People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The acquisition of a nuclear weapon by the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran would pose a grave and serious threat to 
        international peace and security, including the national 
        security of the United States and its allies.
            (2) The United States has led the international community 
        in imposing unprecedented and crippling sanctions with respect 
        to the nuclear program of Iran, which have helped to persuade 
        the leadership of Iran to return to the negotiating table.
            (3) On November 24, 2013, Iran and the P5-plus-1 countries, 
        made up of the 5 permanent members of the United Nations 
        Security Council and Germany, entered into the Joint Plan of 
        Action in order to establish verifiable limits on the nuclear 
        activities of Iran that are of greatest concern with respect to 
        proliferation and to facilitate negotiations toward a final 
        comprehensive arrangement that would prevent Iran from 
        developing a nuclear weapon.
            (4) On November 24, 2014, the P5-plus-1 countries and Iran 
        extended the Joint Plan of Action to allow negotiations to 
        continue with the goal of achieving a political framework 
        arrangement by the end of March 2015, and full technical 
        details by July 1, 2015.
            (5) Under the Joint Plan of Action, the Government of Iran 
        has, among other steps, ceased enrichment of uranium to near-20 
        percent fissile U-235, neutralized its stockpile of 20-percent 
        enriched uranium gas, halted major construction on its heavy 
        water reactor at Arak, halted the installation of additional 
        centrifuges and not operated its more advanced centrifuge 
        machines to accumulate enriched uranium, allowed more frequent 
        and intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy 
        Agency, and allowed managed access to centrifuge production-
        related facilities and uranium mines and mills.
            (6) The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported, 
        including in a January 20, 2015, report, that Iran has complied 
        with its obligations under the Joint Plan of Action.
            (7) Iran has a history of deceit when it comes to its 
        nuclear program and any final comprehensive arrangement must be 
        airtight and verifiable to ensure that Iran will live up to its 
        commitments.
            (8) The United States reserves the option to impose or 
        reimpose certain sanctions in the event that Iran violates the 
        Joint Plan of Action or any successor arrangement agreed to by 
        the P5-plus-1 countries and Iran.
            (9) In his State of the Union address on January 20, 2015, 
        President Barack Obama said, ``[We have a chance to negotiate a 
        comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, 
        secures America and our allies--including Israel, while 
        avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no 
        guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all 
        options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.''.

SEC. 4. ASSESSMENTS OF COMPLIANCE OF IRAN WITH NUCLEAR ARRANGEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--During the period during which the Joint Plan of

        attempted to circumvent enforcement of the Joint Plan of Action 
        or the successor arrangement.
            (3) Whether the International Atomic Energy Agency or any 
        of the P5-plus-1 countries has accused Iran of violating the

        whether the accusation is credible and whether Iran has been 
        apprised of the accusation.
    (c) Certification Required.--The President shall submit, with each 
report required by subsection (a), an unclassified certification by the

        follows: ``All sanctions imposed with respect to Iran that were 
        waived or suspended pursuant to the Joint Action Plan (as

        2015) or a successor arrangement are reinstated and the release 
        of funds or assets to Iran pursuant to the Joint Action Plan or 
        a successor arrangement is prohibited.''.
    (c) Fast Track Consideration in House of Representatives.--
            (1) Reconvening.--Upon receipt of a report described in 
        subsection (a), the Speaker of the House of Representatives, if 
        the House would otherwise be adjourned, shall notify the

        shall convene not later than the second calendar day after 
        receipt of the report.
            (2) Reporting and discharge.--Any committee of the House of 
        Representatives to which qualifying legislation is referred 
        shall report it to the House not later than 5 calendar days 
        after the date of receipt of the report described in subsection 
        (a). If a committee fails to report the qualifying legislation 
        within that period, the committee shall be discharged from 
        further consideration of the qualifying legislation and the 
        qualifying legislation shall be referred to the appropriate 
        calendar.
            (3) Proceeding to consideration.--After each committee 
        authorized to consider qualifying legislation reports it to the 
        House or has been discharged from its consideration, it shall 
        be in order, not later than the sixth day after Congress 
        receives the report described in subsection (a), to move to 
        proceed to consider the qualifying legislation in the House. 
        All points of order against the motion are waived. Such a 
        motion shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a 
        motion to proceed on the qualifying legislation. The previous 
        question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
        adoption without intervening motion. The motion shall not be 
        debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion 
        is disposed of shall not be in order.
            (4) Consideration.--The qualifying legislation shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the qualifying 
        legislation and against its consideration are waived. The

        qualifying legislation to its passage without intervening 
        motion except 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled 
        by the proponent and an opponent. A motion to reconsider the

        order.
    (d) Fast Track Consideration in Senate.--
            (1) Reconvening.--Upon receipt of a report described in 
        subsection (a), if the Senate has adjourned or recessed for 
        more than 2 days, the majority leader of the Senate, after

        on the calendar.
            (3) Floor consideration.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the 
                Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any 
                time during the period beginning on the fourth day 
                after the date on which Congress receives a report 
                described in subsection (a) and ending on the sixth day 
                after the date on which Congress receives that report 
                (even though a previous motion to the same effect has 
                been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
                consideration of the qualifying legislation, and all 
                points of order against the qualifying legislation (and 
                against consideration of the qualifying legislation) 
                are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. The 
                motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A motion 
                to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
                or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of the qualifying 
                legislation is agreed to, the qualifying legislation 
                shall remain the unfinished business until disposed of.
                    (B) Debate.--Debate on the qualifying legislation, 
                and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, 
                which shall be divided equally between the majority and 
                minority leaders or their designees. A motion further 
                to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An 
                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
                motion to recommit the qualifying legislation is not in 
                order.
                    (C) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall 
                occur immediately following the conclusion of the 
                debate on the qualifying legislation, and a single 
                quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.
                    (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may 
                be, to the procedure relating to qualifying legislation 
                shall be decided without debate.
    (e) Rules Relating to Senate and House of Representatives.--
            (1) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before 
        the passage by one House of qualifying legislation of that 
        House, that House receives qualifying legislation from the 
        other House, then the following procedures shall apply:
                    (A) The qualifying legislation of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee.
                    (B) With respect to qualifying legislation of the 
                House receiving the legislation--
                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no qualifying legislation had 
                        been received from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on passage shall be on the 
                        qualifying legislation of the other House.
            (2) Treatment of qualifying legislation of other house.--If 
        one House fails to introduce or consider qualifying legislation 
        under this section, the qualifying legislation of the other 
        House shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under 
        this section.
            (3) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following passage 
        of the qualifying legislation in the Senate, the Senate then 
        receives the companion measure from the House of 
        Representatives, the companion measure shall not be debatable.
            (4) Subsequent measures.--If qualifying legislation has 
        been considered under this section in both Houses of Congress 
        pursuant to a report described in subsection (a), no further 
        qualifying legislation shall be in order until Congress 
        receives a new report described in subsection (a).
    (f) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes qualifying legislation, debate 
on a veto message in the Senate under this section shall be 1 hour 
equally divided between the majority and minority leaders or their 
designees.
    (g) Rules of House of Representatives and Senate.--This section and 
section 6 are enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such are 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of legislation described in those 
        sections, and supersede other rules only to the extent that 
        they are inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

SEC. 6. CONSIDERATION IN THE SENATE OF ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO 
              FURTHER RESPOND TO A VIOLATION BY IRAN OF A NUCLEAR 
              ARRANGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of 
the Senate, it is in order at any time during the 30-day period 
beginning on the date on which a report described in section 5(a) is 
received by Congress (even though a previous motion to the same effect 
has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of 
legislation described in subsection (b), and all points of order 
against the legislation (and against consideration of the legislation) 
are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. The motion is not 
subject to a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If 
a motion to proceed to the consideration of the legislation is agreed 
to, the legislation shall remain the unfinished business until disposed 
of.
    (b) Legislation Described.--Legislation described in this 
subsection is such legislation as the majority leader of the Senate, 
after consultation with the minority leader, determines necessary to 
further respond to a violation by Iran the Joint Plan of Action or any 
successor arrangement.

SEC. 7. ROLE OF CONGRESS IN LIFTING CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED SANCTIONS.

    If the United States is a party to a comprehensive long-term 
arrangement with Iran relating to its nuclear program under which the 
United States commits to lifting sanctions imposed pursuant to any 
provision of law included in a duly enacted Act of Congress, that 
provision of law shall remain in effect until, consistent with section 
7 of article I of the Constitution of the United States and 
notwithstanding the arrangement, repealed by an Act of Congress or 
terminated pursuant to another provision of law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
