        infringed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2) An identification of each claim of each

count or counts of the complaint, counterclaim, or cross-claim for 
patent infringement if the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) 
of subsection (a) are not met with respect to such count or counts. The 
fact that a party pleads in accordance with subsection (c) shall not be 
a basis for dismissal if the party nonetheless states a plausible claim 
for relief sufficient under the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(c) Information Not Accessible.--If some subset of 
information required to comply with subsection (a) is not accessible to

disclose information described under subsection (a) may file

civil action that includes a claim for relief arising under section 
271(e)(2).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Motion for Stay.--In a civil action in which a party 
asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating 
to patents (other than an action that includes a cause of action 
described in section 271(e)), the court shall grant a motion to stay at 
least the portion of the action against a covered customer that relates 
to infringement of a patent involving a covered product or covered 
process if--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS 
              OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Judicial Conference Rules and Procedures on Discovery 
Burdens and Costs.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Rules and procedures.--The Judicial Conference 
        of the United States, using existing resources, should develop 
        rules and procedures to implement the discovery proposals 
        described in paragraph (2) to address concerns regarding the 
        asymmetries in discovery burdens and costs that may arise in a 
        civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
        patents.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Rules and procedures to be considered.--The 
        rules and procedures to be developed under paragraph (1) should 
        address each of the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Discovery of core documentary 
                evidence.--To what extent each party to the action is 
                entitled to receive core documentary evidence and 
                should be responsible for the costs of producing core 
                documentary evidence within the possession or control 
                of each such party, and to what extent each party to 
                the action may seek noncore documentary discovery as 
                otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Electronic communication.--If the 
                parties request discovery of electronic communication, 
                how such discovery should be phased to occur relative 
                to the exchange of initial disclosures and core 
                documentary evidence, and appropriate limitations to 
                apply to such discovery.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) Additional document discovery.--The 
                manner and extent to which the following should 
                apply:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) In general.--Each party to the 
                        action may seek any additional document 
                        discovery beyond core documentary evidence as 
                        permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil 
                        Procedure, if such party bears the reasonable 
                        costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, of 
                        the additional document discovery.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) Requirements for additional 
                        document discovery.--Unless the parties 
                        mutually agree otherwise, no party may be 
                        permitted additional document discovery unless 
                        such a party posts a bond, or provides other 
                        security, in an amount sufficient to cover the 
                        expected costs of such additional document 
                        discovery, or makes a showing to the court that 
                        such party has the financial capacity to pay 
                        the costs of such additional document 
                        discovery.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) Good cause modification.--A 
                        court, upon motion and for good cause shown, 
                        may modify the requirements of subparagraphs 
                        (A) and (B) and any definition under paragraph 
                        (3). Not later than 30 days after the pretrial 
                        conference under rule 16 of the Federal Rules 
                        of Civil Procedure, the parties shall jointly 
                        submit any proposed modifications of the 
                        requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                        any definition under paragraph (3), unless the 
                        parties do not agree, in which case each party 
                        shall submit any proposed modification of such 
                        party and a summary of the disagreement over 
                        the modification.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iv) Computer code.--A court, upon 
                        motion and for good cause shown, may determine 
                        that computer code should be included in the 
                        discovery of core documentary evidence. The 
                        discovery of computer code shall occur after 
                        the parties have exchanged initial disclosures 
                        and other core documentary evidence.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Discovery sequence and scope.--The 
                manner and extent to which the parties shall discuss 
                and address in the written report filed pursuant to 
                rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the 
                views and proposals of each party on the 
                following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) When the discovery of core 
                        documentary evidence should be 
                        completed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) Whether additional document 
                        discovery will be sought under subparagraph 
                        (C).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) Any issues about 
                        infringement, invalidity, or damages that, if 
                        resolved before the additional discovery 
                        described in subparagraph (C) commences, might 
                        simplify or streamline the case.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Scope of documentary evidence.--In developing 
        rules or procedures under this section, the Judicial Conference 
        should consider which kinds of evidence constitute ``core 
        documentary evidence''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Definitions.--In this subsection the term 
        ``electronic communication'' means any form of electronic 
        communication, including email, text message, or instant 
        message.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Judicial Conference Patent Case Management.--The 
Judicial Conference of the United States, using existing resources, 
should develop case management procedures to be implemented by the 
United States district courts and the United States Court of Federal 
Claims for any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating 
to patents, including initial disclosure and early case management 
conference practices that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) will identify any potential dispositive issues 
        of the case; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) focus on early summary judgment motions when 
        resolution of issues may lead to expedited disposition of the 
        case.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 7. FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES.

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, 
in patent cases, reasonable attorney fees should be paid by a non-
prevailing party whose litigation position or conduct is not 
objectively reasonable. As the Supreme Court wrote in adopting this 
legal standard in the context of fee shifting under section 1447 of 
title 28, United States Code, this standard is intended to strike a 
balance; in patent cases, a more appropriate balance between protecting 
the right of a patent holder to enforce its patent on the one hand, and 
deterring abuses in patent litigation and threats thereof on the 
other.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Amendment.--Section 285 of title 35, United States 
Code, is amended to read as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 285. Fees and other expenses&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Award.--In connection with a civil action in which 
any party asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress 
relating to patents, upon motion by a prevailing party, the court shall 
determine whether the position of the non-prevailing party was 
objectively reasonable in law and fact, and whether the conduct of the 
non-prevailing party was objectively reasonable. If the court finds 
that the position of the non-prevailing party was not objectively 
reasonable in law or fact or that the conduct of the non-prevailing 
party was not objectively reasonable, the court shall award reasonable 
attorney fees to the prevailing party unless special circumstances 
would make an award unjust.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Covenant Not To Sue.--A party to a civil action who 
asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating 
to patents against another party, and who subsequently unilaterally (i) 
seeks dismissal of the action without consent of the other party and 
(ii) extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement 
with respect to the patent or patents at issue, may be the subject of a 
motion for attorney fees under subsection (a) as if it were a non-
prevailing party, unless the party asserting such claim would have been 
entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to dismiss 
voluntarily the action without a court order under rule 41 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the interests of justice require 
otherwise.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(c) Recovery of Award.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) Certification; disclosure of interested 
        parties.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) Initial statement.--A party 
                defending against a claim of infringement may file, not 
                later than 14 days before a scheduling conference is to 
                be held or a scheduling order is due under rule 16(b) 
                of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a statement 
                that such party holds a good faith belief, based on 
                publicly-available information and any other 
                information known to such party, that the primary 
                business of the party alleging infringement is the 
                assertion and enforcement of patents or the licensing 
                resulting therefrom.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) Certification.--Not later than 45

                        of reasonable attorney fees under this section 
                        if an award is assessed;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

the complaint, counterclaim, or cross-claim for patent infringement if 
the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) are

dismissal if the party nonetheless states a plausible claim for relief 
sufficient under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

                in the case is entered.
    ``(c) Manufacturer Consent in Certain Cases.--If the covered 
manufacturer has been made a party to the action on motion by the 
covered customer, then a motion under subsection (b) may only be 
granted if the covered manufacturer and the covered customer agree in 
writing to the stay.
    ``(d) Lift of Stay.--
            ``(1) In general.--A stay entered under this section may be 
        lifted upon grant of a motion based on a showing that--
                    ``(A) the action involving the covered manufacturer 
                will not resolve major issues in the suit against the 
                covered customer, such as that a covered product or 
                covered process identified in the motion to lift the 
                stay is not a material part of the claimed invention or 
                inventions in the patent or patents in dispute; or

                manifestly unjust to the party seeking to lift the

            ``(2) Separate actions.--In the case of a stay entered 
        under this section based on the participation of the covered 
        manufacturer in a separate action described in subsection 
        (b)(1), a motion under paragraph (1) may only be granted if the 
        court in such separate action determines that the showing 
        required under paragraph (1) has been made.
    ``(e) Waiver of Estoppel Effect.--If, following the grant of a 
motion to stay under this section, the covered manufacturer in an 
action described in subsection (b)(1)--

        involving one or more of the issues that gave rise to the stay;

        judgment a final decision as to one or more of the issues that 
        gave rise to the stay,
the court may, upon motion, determine that such consent judgment or 
unappealed final decision shall not be binding on the covered customer 
with respect to one or more of the issues that gave rise to the stay 
based on a showing that such an outcome would unreasonably prejudice or 
be manifestly unjust to the covered customer in light of the 
circumstances of the case.
    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to limit the ability of a court to grant any stay, expand any 
stay granted pursuant to this section, or grant any motion to 
intervene, if otherwise permitted by law.''.

SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
              JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.

    (a) Judicial Conference Rules and Procedures on Discovery Burdens 
and Costs.--
            (1) Rules and procedures.--The Judicial Conference of the 
        United States, using existing resources, should develop rules 
        and procedures to implement the discovery proposals described 
        in paragraph (2) to address concerns regarding the asymmetries 
        in discovery burdens and costs that may arise in a civil action 
        arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.
            (2) Rules and procedures to be considered.--The rules and 
        procedures to be developed under paragraph (1) should address 
        each of the following:
                    (A) Discovery of core documentary evidence.--To 
                what extent each party to the action is entitled to 
                receive core documentary evidence and should be 
                responsible for the costs of producing core documentary 
                evidence within the possession or control of each such 
                party, and to what extent each party to the action may 
                seek noncore documentary discovery as otherwise 
                provided in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
                    (B) Electronic communication.--If the parties 
                request discovery of electronic communication, how such 
                discovery should be phased to occur relative to the 
                exchange of initial disclosures and core documentary 
                evidence, and appropriate limitations to apply to such 
                discovery.
                    (C) Additional document discovery.--The manner and 
                extent to which the following should apply:
                            (i) In general.--Each party to the action 
                        may seek any additional document discovery 
                        beyond core documentary evidence as permitted 
                        under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if 
                        such party bears the reasonable costs, 
                        including reasonable attorney's fees, of the 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (ii) Requirements for additional document 
                        discovery.--Unless the parties mutually agree 
                        otherwise, no party may be permitted additional 
                        document discovery unless such a party posts a 
                        bond, or provides other security, in an amount 
                        sufficient to cover the expected costs of such 
                        additional document discovery, or makes a 
                        showing to the court that such party has the 
                        financial capacity to pay the costs of such 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (iii) Good cause modification.--A court, 
                        upon motion and for good cause shown, may 
                        modify the requirements of subparagraphs (A) 
                        and (B) and any definition under paragraph (3). 
                        Not later than 30 days after the pretrial 
                        conference under rule 16 of the Federal Rules 
                        of Civil Procedure, the parties shall jointly 
                        submit any proposed modifications of the 
                        requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                        any definition under paragraph (3), unless the 
                        parties do not agree, in which case each party 
                        shall submit any proposed modification of such 
                        party and a summary of the disagreement over 
                        the modification.
                            (iv) Computer code.--A court, upon motion 
                        and for good cause shown, may determine that 
                        computer code should be included in the 
                        discovery of core documentary evidence. The 
                        discovery of computer code shall occur after 
                        the parties have exchanged initial disclosures 
                        and other core documentary evidence.
                    (D) Discovery sequence and scope.--The manner and 
                extent to which the parties shall discuss and address 
                in the written report filed pursuant to rule 26(f) of 
                the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the views and 
                proposals of each party on the following:
                            (i) When the discovery of core documentary 
                        evidence should be completed.
                            (ii) Whether additional document discovery 
                        will be sought under subparagraph (C).
                            (iii) Any issues about infringement, 
                        invalidity, or damages that, if resolved before 
                        the additional discovery described in 
                        subparagraph (C) commences, might simplify or 
                        streamline the case.
            (3) Scope of documentary evidence.--In developing rules or 
        procedures under this section, the Judicial Conference should 
        consider which kinds of evidence constitute ``core documentary 
        evidence''.
            (4) Definitions.--In this subsection, the term ``electronic 
        communication'' means any form of electronic communication, 
        including email, text message, or instant message.
    (b) Judicial Conference Patent Case Management.--The Judicial 
Conference of the United States, using existing resources, should 
develop case management procedures to be implemented by the United 
States district courts and the United States Court of Federal Claims 
for any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
patents, including initial disclosure and early case management 
conference practices that--
            (1) will identify any potential dispositive issues of the 
        case; and
            (2) focus on early summary judgment motions when resolution 
        of issues may lead to expedited disposition of the case.

SEC. 7. FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, in patent 
cases, reasonable attorney fees should be paid by a non-prevailing 
party whose litigation position or conduct is not objectively 
reasonable. As the Supreme Court wrote in adopting this legal standard 
in the context of fee shifting under section 1447 of title 28, United 
States Code, this standard is intended to strike a balance; in patent 
cases, a more appropriate balance between protecting the right of a 
patent holder to enforce its patent on the one hand, and deterring 
abuses in patent litigation and threats thereof on the other.
    (b) Amendment.--Section 285 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 285. Fees and other expenses
    ``(a) Award.--In connection with a civil action in which any party 
asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating 
to patents, upon motion by a prevailing party, the court shall 
determine whether the position of the non-prevailing party was 
objectively reasonable in law and fact, and whether the conduct of the 
non-prevailing party was objectively reasonable. If the court finds 
that the position of the non-prevailing party was not objectively 
reasonable in law or fact or that the conduct of the non-prevailing 
party was not objectively reasonable, the court shall award reasonable 
attorney fees to the prevailing party unless special circumstances, 
such as undue economic hardship to a named inventor or an institution 
of higher education (as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a))), would make an award unjust. 
The prevailing party shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the 
prevailing party is entitled to an award.
    ``(b) Covenant Not To Sue.--A party to a civil action who asserts a 
claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents 
against another party, and who subsequently unilaterally (i) seeks 
dismissal of the action without consent of the other party and (ii) 
extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement with 
respect to the patent or patents at issue, may be the subject of a 
motion for attorney fees under subsection (a) as if it were a non-
prevailing party, unless the party asserting such claim would have been 
entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to dismiss 
voluntarily the action without a court order under rule 41 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the interests of justice require 
otherwise.
    ``(c) Recovery of Award.--
            ``(1) Certification; disclosure of interested parties.--
                    ``(A) Initial statement.--A party defending against 
                a claim of infringement may file, not later than 14 
                days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a 
                scheduling order is due under rule 16(b) of the Federal 
                Rules of Civil Procedure, a statement that such party 
                holds a good faith belief, based on publicly-available 
                information and any other information known to such 
                party, that the primary business of the party alleging 
                infringement is the assertion and enforcement of 
                patents or the licensing resulting therefrom.
                    ``(B) Certification.--Not later than 45 days after 
                being served with an initial statement under 
                subparagraph (A), a party alleging infringement shall 
                file a certification that--
                            ``(i) establishes and certifies to the 
                        court, under oath, that it will have sufficient 
                        funds available to satisfy any award of 
                        reasonable attorney fees under this section if 
                        an award is assessed;

                        therefrom;

                subparagraph within 30 days after a material change to 
                the information provided in its certification.
