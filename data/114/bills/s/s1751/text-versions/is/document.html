                                 A BILL


 
To provide for a grant program for handgun licensing programs, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In 2013, more than 33,000 Americans were killed by guns 
        and almost 90 percent of the firearms used in these deaths were 
        handguns.
            (2) Recently published research by top national experts, 
        notably on Missouri and Connecticut handgun purchaser licensing 
        laws, have estimated that Missouri's repeal of its handgun 
        purchaser licensing law led to a 25-percent increase in firearm 
        homicide rates while Connecticut's adoption of its handgun 
        purchaser licensing law led to a 40-percent decrease in firearm 
        homicide rates.
            (3) In States which have had effective handgun purchaser 
        licensing laws for decades, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
        New Jersey, and New York, the vast majority of guns traced to 
        crimes originated in other States, which supports the need for 
        handgun purchaser licensing laws in every State.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the terms ``Attorney General'' and ``handgun'' have the 
        meanings given those terms in section 921(a) of title 18, 
        United States Code; and
            (2) the term ``Indian tribe'' has the meaning given the 
        term in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and 
        Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).

SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM AUTHORIZED FOR HANDGUN LICENSING.

handgun purchaser licensing programs.
