                                 A BILL


 
   To promote pro bono legal services as a critical way in which to 
                empower survivors of domestic violence.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and 
Represent Act of 2015'' or ``POWER Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating 
        violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local, 
        State, and national levels and such violence or behavior harms 
        the most vulnerable members of our society.
            (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of 
        Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic 
        violence during their lifetime.
            (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all 
        forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the 
        violence that destroys lives and shatters families.
            (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating 
        violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of 
        solutions at the local, State, and national level are necessary 
        to combat such violence or behavior.
            (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic 
        Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700 
        assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September 
        2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal 
        representation, were not met.
            (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by 
        providing not only legal representation, but also access to 
        emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare.
            (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the 
        provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, 
        dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking reduces the 
        probability of such violence or behavior reoccurring in the 
        future and can help survivors move forward.
            (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of 
        successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, 
        preventing further mental and physical injury to a victim and 
        his or her family, demonstrated by a study that found that 83 
        percent of victims represented by an attorney were able to 
        obtain a protective order compared to 32 percent of victims 
        without an attorney.
            (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include 
        commentary that ``every lawyer, regardless of professional 
        prominence or professional workload, has a responsibility to 
        provide legal services to those unable to pay, and personal 
        involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of 
        the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer''.
            (10) As representatives of the Department of Justice, the 
        duty of United States Attorneys is to present ``equal and 
        impartial justice to all its citizens,'' which should include, 
        especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, 
        sexual assault, and stalking who might not otherwise know how 
        to seek advice and protection.
            (11) As Federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic 
        violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in 
        their localities, United States Attorneys should encourage 
        lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help 
        victims of such violence or behavior to escape the cycle of 
        abuse.
            (12) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this 
        mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause and 
        will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence, 
        dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the 
        country.
            (13) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal 
        services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence, 
        dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower 
        those survivors to move forward with their lives.
