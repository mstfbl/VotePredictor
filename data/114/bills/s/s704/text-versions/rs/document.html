                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 11, 2015

 Mr. Grassley (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Franken, Mr.

                                 A BILL


 
    To establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan 
   demonstration program to target home and community-based care to 
                    eligible Medicare beneficiaries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Based 
Independence for Seniors Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Community-based services play an essential 
        role in keeping individuals healthy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Without community-based long-term services and 
        supports, which are not typically covered by Medicare, seniors 
        frequently experience negative health outcomes and lose their 
        ability to live independently.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Seniors who deplete their resources often have 
        no option but to turn to Medicaid for coverage of long-term 
        care expenses.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Targeting community-based services and 
        supports to at-risk seniors can help these individuals avoid 
        depleting their assets and becoming Medicaid 
        dependent.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN 
              DEMONSTRATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
Services (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall

        enrollees) in such program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Benefits.--Under the CBI-SNP demonstration

                equipment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Payments.--The Secretary shall establish a 
        benchmark payment amount for reimbursing Medicare Advantage 
        plans participating in the CBI-SNP demonstration program for 
        benefits provided to eligible beneficiaries under such program.

        under subsection (h); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        demonstration program to the extent determined appropriate by 
        the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that such 
        expansion is expected to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) increase expenditures under titles 
                XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act with respect

        requirements, recognizing that definitions, benefits and 
        program requirements for long-term care services and supports 
        vary across States. Such evaluation shall determine whether the 
        CBI-SNP demonstration program has--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) improved patient care;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) reduced hospitalizations or

                demonstration population and beneficiary and caregiver

        implementation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program, the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report containing the 
        results of the evaluation conducted under paragraph (1), 
        together with such recommendations for legislative or 
        administrative action as the Secretary determines appropriate. 
        In preparing such report, the Secretary shall use at least 3 
        years worth of data under the demonstration program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) Budget Neutrality.--By the end of the third year of 
the CBI-SNP demonstration program, the Secretary shall ensure that the 
aggregate payments made under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social 
Security Act, including under the demonstration program, for subsequent 
periods do not exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates would 
have been expended under such titles during such a period if the CBI-
SNP demonstration program had not been implemented.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Based Independence for 
Seniors Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Community-based services play an essential role in 
        keeping individuals healthy.
            (2) Without community-based long-term services and 
        supports, which are not typically covered by Medicare, seniors 
        frequently experience negative health outcomes and lose their 
        ability to live independently.
            (3) Seniors who deplete their resources often have no 
        option but to turn to Medicaid for coverage of long-term care 
        expenses.
            (4) Targeting community-based services and supports to at-
        risk seniors can help these individuals avoid depleting their 
        assets and becoming Medicaid dependent.

SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN DEMONSTRATION.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
(referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a 
Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program

    (b) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall enter into agreements

a period of 5 years.
    (h) Budget Neutrality.--In conducting the CBI-SNP demonstration

        independent third party. Such evaluation shall be completed 
        using evaluation criteria that are clearly articulated prior to 
        the implementation of such program. Such criteria shall include 
        specific goals of such program, hypotheses being tested, and 
        clear data collection and reporting requirements, recognizing 
        that definitions, benefits, and program requirements for long-
        term care services and supports vary across States. Such 
        evaluation shall determine whether the CBI-SNP demonstration 
        program has--
                    (A) improved patient care;
                    (B) reduced hospitalizations or rehospitalizations;

                population and beneficiary and caregiver satisfaction.
            (2) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2022, the Secretary 
        shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the 
        evaluation conducted under paragraph (1), together with such 
        recommendations for legislative or administrative action as the 
        Secretary determines appropriate. In preparing such report, the 
        Secretary shall use at least 3 years worth of data under the 
        CBI-SNP demonstration program.
    (k) Funding.--
            (1) Funding for implementation.--For purposes of 
        administering the CBI-SNP demonstration program (other than the 
        evaluation and report under subsection (j)), the Secretary

        Insurance Trust Fund under section 1817 of the Social Security

        Insurance Trust Fund under section 1841 of such Act (42 U.S.C.
