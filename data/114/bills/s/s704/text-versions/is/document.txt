                                 A BILL


 
    To establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan 
   demonstration program to target home and community-based care to 
                    eligible Medicare beneficiaries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Based Independence for 
Seniors Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Community-based services play an essential role in 
        keeping individuals healthy.
            (2) Without community-based long-term services and 
        supports, which are not typically covered by Medicare, seniors 
        frequently experience negative health outcomes and lose their 
        ability to live independently.
            (3) Seniors who deplete their resources often have no 
        option but to turn to Medicaid for coverage of long-term care 
        expenses.
            (4) Targeting community-based services and supports to at-
        risk seniors can help these individuals avoid depleting their 
        assets and becoming Medicaid dependent.

SEC. 3. COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN DEMONSTRATION.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in 
this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a

        such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w22(a)(3))) and notwithstanding any

                XIX of the Social Security Act with respect to eligible 
                Medicare beneficiaries participating in the CBI-SNP

        years worth of data under the demonstration program.
    (i) Budget Neutrality.--By the end of the third year of the CBI-SNP 
demonstration program, the Secretary shall ensure that the aggregate 
payments made under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act, 
including under the demonstration program, for subsequent periods do

expended under such titles during such a period if the CBI-SNP 
demonstration program had not been implemented.
    (j) Paperwork Reduction Act.--Chapter 35 of title 44, United States 
Code, shall not apply to the testing and evaluation of the CBI-SNP 
demonstration program.
