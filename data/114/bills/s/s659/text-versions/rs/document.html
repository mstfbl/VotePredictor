                amounts are made available.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Sense of Congress Regarding Cooperation.--It is the 
sense of Congress that, consistent with applicable laws (including 
regulations), the Chief of the Forest Service and the Director of the 
Bureau of Land Management should cooperate with State and local 
authorities and other entities to carry out waste removal and other 
activities on any Federal land used as a public target range to 
encourage continued use of that land for target practice or 
marksmanship training.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
