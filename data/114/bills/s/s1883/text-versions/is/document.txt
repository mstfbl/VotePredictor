SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Each year in the United States there are an estimated 
        15,780 children between birth and the age of 19 diagnosed with 
        cancer. Approximately 1 in 285 children in the United States 
        will be diagnosed with cancer before their 20th birthday.
            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer 
        survived more than 5 years, but today, cure rates have 
        increased to over 80 percent for children and adolescents under 
        age 20.
            (3) While the cure rates for some childhood cancers are now 
        over 80 percent, the survival rates for many types of cancers 
        in children remain extremely low.
            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, cancer continues to be the leading cause of death 
        by disease in children and adolescents under the age of 14.
            (5) By 2020, the population of childhood cancers survivors 
        is expected to be 500,000 individuals.
            (6) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are 
        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, 
        with as many as one-fourth experiencing a late effect that is 
        serious or life-threatening. Common late effects of childhood 
        cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, 
        endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects, secondary malignancies, 
        and early death.
            (7) As a result of disparities in the delivery of cancer 
        care, minority, low-income, and other medically underserved 
        children are more likely to be diagnosed with late stage 
        disease, experience poorer treatment outcomes, have shorter 
        survival time with less quality of life, and experience a 
        substantially greater likelihood of cancer death.
            (8) Collection of biospecimens, along with clinical and 
        outcome data, on the maximum possible number of children with 
        cancer in the United States is necessary to improve childhood 
        cancer treatments and cures. Currently biospecimens, and 
        clinical and outcome data, are collected for less than half of 
        children in the United States with cancer.
            (9) Despite the significant unmet medical need, 
        pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to develop drugs 
        appropriate for children with cancer because it requires making 
        an investment in products that are unlikely to cover the high 
        costs associated with their research, development, marketing, 
        and distribution. Only 3 drugs have been approved by the Food 
        and Drug Administration to treat any type of pediatric cancer 
        since the 1980s, including Unituxin, the first-ever drug 
        approved for high-risk neuroblastoma, for which the sponsor of 
        the drug was rewarded under the Food and Drug Administration's 
        priority review program to encourage treatments for rare 
        pediatric diseases.
            (10) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as 
        therapies evolve, which means that the monitoring and care of 
        cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.
            (11) Despite the intense stress caused by childhood cancer, 
        there is a lack of standardized and coordinated psychosocial 
        care for the children and their families, from the date of 
        diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.
            (12) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer 
        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: 
        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized 
        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer 
        survivors is needed.
            (13) Focused and well-designed research and pilot health 
        delivery programs can answer questions about the optimal ways 
        to provide health care, follow-up monitoring services, and 
        survivorship care to those diagnosed with childhood cancer and 
        contribute to improvements in the quality of care and quality 
        of life of those individuals through adulthood.
            (14) The National Institutes of Health, including the 
        National Cancer Institute, invest approximately half of their 
        annual appropriations to support basic research that serves as 
        the foundation for translational and clinical research for all 
        diseases and conditions, with the potential to lead to 
        breakthroughs for children with cancer. Virtually all progress 
        against cancer--in both children and adults--has been founded 
        in basic research, often in areas not directly related to the 
        disease.
            (15) The National Cancer Institute supports a number of key 
        research programs specifically to advance childhood cancer 
        care, including precision medicine clinical trials for children 
        with cancer, including the Children's Oncology Group (part of 
        the National Clinical Trials Network of the National Cancer 
        Institute), the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program, the 
        Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, the Childhood Cancer Survivor 
        Study, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate 
        Effective Treatments program and related pediatric cancer 
        genomics research, and the Pediatric Oncology Branch (part of 
        the intramural program of the National Cancer Institute, whose 
        mission is to develop new treatments for pediatric cancer).

        demographic information for at least 90 percent of all 
        children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer in 1 or 
        more Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories to achieve 
        a better understanding of the cause of such cancers and the 
        effects of treatments for such cancers.
            ``(2) Use of funds.--Amounts received under the award under 
        paragraph (1) may be used to carry out the following:

                peer-reviewed research at a minimal cost.
            ``(3) No requirement.--No child, adolescent, or young adult 
        with cancer shall be required under this subsection to
