              TITLE VI--CONVEYANCE OF COAST GUARD PROPERTY

Subtitle A--Conveyance of Coast Guard Property in Point Spencer, Alaska

SEC. 601. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Major shipping traffic is increasing through the Bering 
        Strait, the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and the Arctic Ocean and 
        will continue to increase whether or not development of the 
        outer Continental Shelf of the United States is undertaken in 
        the future and will increase further if such outer Continental 
        Shelf development is undertaken.
            (2) There is a compelling national, State, Alaska Native, 
        and private sector need for permanent infrastructure 
        development and for a presence in the Arctic region of Alaska 
        by appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, particularly 
        in proximity to the Bering Strait, to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of Alaska Native 
        archaeological and cultural resources, port of refuge, Arctic 
        research, and maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the 
        Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.
            (3) The United States owns a parcel of land, known as Point 
        Spencer, located between the Bering Strait and Port Clarence 
        and adjacent to some of the best potential deepwater port sites 
        on the coast of Alaska in the Arctic.
            (4) Prudent and effective use of Point Spencer may be best 
        achieved through marshaling the energy, resources, and 
        leadership of the public and private sectors.
            (5) It is in the national interest to develop 
        infrastructure at Point Spencer that would aid the Coast Guard 
        in performing its statutory duties and functions in the Arctic 
        on a more permanent basis and to allow for public and private 
        sector development of facilities and other infrastructure to 
        support purposes that are of benefit to the United States.
