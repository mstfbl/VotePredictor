    &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE VI--CONVEYANCE OF COAST GUARD PROPERTY&lt;/DELETED&gt;

   &lt;DELETED&gt;Subtitle A--Conveyance of Coast Guard Property in Point 
                       Spencer, Alaska&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 601. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Major shipping traffic is increasing through 
        the Bering Strait, the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and the Arctic 
        Ocean and will continue to increase whether or not development 
        of the outer Continental Shelf of the United States is 
        undertaken in the future and will increase further if such 
        outer Continental Shelf development is undertaken.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) There is a compelling national, State, Alaska 
        Native, and private sector need for permanent infrastructure 
        development and for a presence in the Arctic region of Alaska 
        by appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, particularly 
        in proximity to the Bering Strait, to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of Alaska Native 
        archaeological and cultural resources, port of refuge, Arctic 
        research, and maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the 
        Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The United States owns a parcel of land, known 
        as Point Spencer, located between the Bering Strait and Port 
        Clarence and adjacent to some of the best potential deepwater 
        port sites on the coast of Alaska in the Arctic.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Prudent and effective use of Point Spencer may 
        be best achieved through marshaling the energy, resources, and 
        leadership of the public and private sectors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) It is in the national interest to develop 
        infrastructure at Point Spencer that would aid the Coast Guard 
        in performing its statutory duties and functions in the Arctic 
        on a more permanent basis and to allow for public and private 
        sector development of facilities and other infrastructure to 
        support purposes that are of benefit to the United 
        States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

              TITLE VI--CONVEYANCE OF COAST GUARD PROPERTY

Subtitle A--Conveyance of Coast Guard Property in Point Spencer, Alaska

SEC. 601. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Major shipping traffic is increasing through the Bering 
        Strait, the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and the Arctic Ocean and 
        will continue to increase whether or not development of the 
        outer Continental Shelf of the United States is undertaken in 
        the future and will increase further if such outer Continental 
        Shelf development is undertaken.
            (2) There is a compelling national, State, Alaska Native, 
        and private sector need for permanent infrastructure 
        development and for a presence in the Arctic region of Alaska 
        by appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, particularly 
        in proximity to the Bering Strait, to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of Alaska Native 
        archaeological and cultural resources, port of refuge, Arctic 
        research, and maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the 
        Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.
            (3) The United States owns a parcel of land, known as Point 
        Spencer, located between the Bering Strait and Port Clarence 
        and adjacent to some of the best potential deepwater port sites 
        on the coast of Alaska in the Arctic.
            (4) Prudent and effective use of Point Spencer may be best 
        achieved through marshaling the energy, resources, and 
        leadership of the public and private sectors.
            (5) It is in the national interest to develop 
        infrastructure at Point Spencer that would aid the Coast Guard 
        in performing its statutory duties and functions in the Arctic 
        on a more permanent basis and to allow for public and private 
        sector development of facilities and other infrastructure to 
        support purposes that are of benefit to the United States.

              TITLE VIII--VESSEL INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Vessel Incidental Discharge Act''.

SEC. 802. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Beginning with enactment of the Act to Prevent 
        Pollution from Ships in 1980 (22 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), the 
        United States Coast Guard has been the principal Federal 
        authority charged with administering, enforcing, and 
        prescribing regulations relating to the discharge of pollutants 
        from vessels engaged in maritime commerce and transportation.
            (2) The Coast Guard estimates there are approximately 
        21,560,000 State-registered recreational vessels, 75,000 
        commercial fishing vessels, and 33,000 freight and tank barges 
        operating in United States waters.
            (3) From 1973 to 2005, certain discharges incidental to the 
        normal operation of a vessel were exempted by regulation from 
        otherwise applicable permitting requirements.
            (4) Over the 32 years during which this regulatory 
        exemption was in effect, Congress enacted statutes on a number 
        of occasions dealing with the regulation of discharges 
        incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, including--
                    (A) the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 
                U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) in 1980;
                    (B) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention 
                and Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.);
                    (C) the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 (110 
                Stat. 4073);
                    (D) section 415 of the Coast Guard Authorization 
                Act of 1998 (112 Stat. 3434) and section 623 of the 
                Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (33 
                U.S.C. 1901 note), which established interim and 
                permanent requirements, respectively, for the 
                regulation of vessel discharges of certain bulk cargo 
                residue;
                    (E) title XIV of division B of Appendix D of the 
                Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 (114 Stat. 2763), 
                which prohibited or limited certain vessel discharges 
                in certain areas of Alaska;
                    (F) section 204 of the Maritime Transportation 
                Security Act of 2002 (33 U.S.C. 1902a), which 
                established requirements for the regulation of vessel 
                discharges of agricultural cargo residue material in 
                the form of hold washings; and
                    (G) title X of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 
                2010 (33 U.S.C. 3801 et seq.), which provided for the 
                implementation of the International Convention on the 
                Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide for the 
establishment of nationally uniform and environmentally sound standards 
and requirements for the management of discharges incidental to the 
normal operation of a vessel.
