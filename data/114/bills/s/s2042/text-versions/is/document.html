                                 A BILL


 
To amend the National Labor Relations Act to strengthen protections for 
employees wishing to advocate for improved wages, hours, or other terms 
 or conditions of employment and to provide for stronger remedies for 
        interference with these rights, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Workplace Action for a Growing 
Economy Act'' or the ``WAGE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et 
        seq.) was enacted to encourage the practice of collective 
        bargaining and to protect the exercise by workers of full 
        freedom of association in the workplace. Since its enactment in 
        1935, tens of millions of workers have bargained with their 
        employers over wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions 
        of employment and have raised the standard of living for all 
        workers.
            (2) Through acting collectively and bargaining with their 
        employers, workers who are unionized earn 21.3 percent more 
        than workers who are not covered by a collective bargaining 
        agreement. They are 28.4 percent more likely to be covered by 
        employer-provided health insurance and 30.9 percent more likely 
        to have employer-provided pensions. The wage differential is 
        even more pronounced for women and people of color. Unionized 
        African-American workers earn 24.6 percent more than African-
        American workers who are not unionized, and unionized Latino 
        workers earn 29.3 percent more than their peers who are not 
        unionized. Unionized women earn 24 percent more than women who 
        are not unionized, and the wage gap between men and women is 
        much smaller at unionized workplaces. The wage gains achieved 
        through collective bargaining benefit workers and their 
        communities.
            (3) Unions and collective bargaining ensure that 
        productivity gains are shared by working people. The decline in 
        the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining has 
        contributed significantly to skyrocketing income inequality and 
        flat wages.
            (4) As enacted in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act 
        (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) protects the right of all workers to 
        join together with their co-workers to advocate for 
        improvements in their pay, benefits, and working conditions, 
        regardless of whether they seek representation by a union. The 
        law protects the right of workers to discuss issues like pay 
        and benefits without retaliation or interference by employers. 
        However, the awareness of workers regarding their rights under 
        the law is lacking, and many employers maintain policies that 
        restrict the ability of workers to discuss workplace issues 
        with each other, directly contravening these rights. Research 
        shows that more than one-half of workers report that their 
        employers have policies that prohibit or discourage workers 
        from discussing pay with their co-workers. These policies and 
        practices impede workers from exercising their rights under the 
        law and impair their freedom of association at work.
            (5) Retaliation by employers against workers who exercise 
        their rights under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 
        151 et seq.) persists at troubling levels. Employers routinely 
        fire workers for trying to form a union at their workplace. In 
        one out of 3 organizing campaigns, one or more workers are 
        discharged for supporting joining a union. In fiscal year 2014, 
        the National Labor Relations Board obtained reinstatement 
        orders for 3,240 workers and obtained backpay awards totaling 
        $43,800,000 for workers who faced illegal retaliation for 
        exercising their rights. Discrimination for organizing hurts 
        all workers, but minorities in particular, as minorities are 
        more likely than Whites to seek to organize and receive a 
        larger wage premium from collective bargaining.
            (6) The current remedies are inadequate to deter employers 
        from violating the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 
        et seq.). The remedies and penalties for violations of the 
        National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) are far 
        weaker than for other labor and employment laws, including the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). Unlike 
        other major labor and employment laws, there are no civil 
        penalties for violations of the law. Workers cannot go to court 
        to pursue relief on their own; they must rely on the National 
        Labor Relations Board to prosecute their case.
            (7) In order to make the right to collective bargaining and 
        freedom of association in the workplace a reality for workers, 
        the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) must 
        be strengthened.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to strengthen protections for employees engaged in 
        collective action to improve their wages, hours, and terms and 
        conditions of employment;
            (2) to provide for stronger remedies for employees who face 
        retaliation, discrimination, or other interference with the 
        legal right of the employees to engage in collective action;
            (3) to provide for penalties against employers who violate 
        the rights of employees to engage in collective action, in 
        order to act as a meaningful deterrent against violating the 
        law; and
            (4) to streamline the enforcement procedures of the 
        National Labor Relations Board to provide for more timely and 
        effective enforcement of the law.

SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING REMEDIES AND ENFORCEMENT FOR EMPLOYEES EXERCISING 
              THEIR RIGHTS AT WORK.

(4) of section 8(a) or has committed a violation of section 8(a) that 
results in the discharge of an employee or other serious economic loss 
to an employee, the Board shall award the employee back pay and an 
additional amount as liquidated damages equal to 2 times the amount of 
such back pay, without any reduction (including any reduction based on 
the employee's interim earnings or failure to earn interim earnings): 
Provided further,''.
    (b) Civil Penalties.--Section 12 of the National Labor Relations 
Act (29 U.S.C. 162) is amended--

        described in such section; and
            ``(3) impose a civil penalty in an amount determined

        discharge of an employee or other serious economic loss to an 
        employee shall, in addition to any remedy ordered by the Board, 
        be subject to a civil penalty. Such penalty shall be in an 
        amount not to exceed $50,000 for each violation, except that 
        the Board shall double the amount of such penalty, to an amount

                public interest; and
                    ``(C) the size of the employer.
            ``(3) Personal liability.--If the Board determines, based 
        on the particular facts and circumstances presented, that 
        personal liability is warranted, a civil penalty for a 
        violation described in this subsection may also be assessed 
        against any officer or director of the employer who committed 
        the violation or had the authority to prevent the violation.

        bargaining have not been cast in favor of representation by the

        designating the labor organization as their collective 
        bargaining representative.
