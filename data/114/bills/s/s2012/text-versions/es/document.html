    Beginning in fiscal year 2016 and each fiscal year thereafter 
through fiscal year 2025, the head of each Federal agency shall, unless 
otherwise specified and where life-cycle cost-effective, promote 
building energy conservation, efficiency, and management by reducing,

            (2) in consultation with the Secretary, issue guidelines 
        for the Federal Housing Administration to determine the 
        estimated energy savings under subsection (c) for properties 
        with an energy efficiency report.
    (b) Requirements.--The enhanced energy efficiency underwriting 
valuation guidelines required under subsection (a) shall include--
            (1) a requirement that if an energy efficiency report that 
        meets the requirements of section 1502(c)(2) is voluntarily 
        provided to the mortgagee, such report shall be used by the 
        mortgagee or the Federal Housing Administration to determine 
        the estimated energy savings of the subject property; and
            (2) a requirement that the estimated energy savings of the 
        subject property be added to the appraised value of the subject 
        property by a mortgagee or the Federal Housing Administration 
        for the purpose of determining the loan-to-value ratio of the 
        subject property, unless the appraisal includes the value of 
        the overall energy efficiency of the subject property, using 
        methods to be established under the guidelines issued under 
        subsection (a).
    (c) Determination of Estimated Energy Savings.--
            (1) Amount of energy savings.--The amount of estimated 
        energy savings shall be determined by calculating the 
        difference between the estimated energy costs for the average 
        comparable houses, as determined in guidelines to be issued 
        under subsection (a), and the estimated energy costs for the 
        subject property based upon the energy efficiency report.
            (2) Duration of energy savings.--The duration of the 
        estimated energy savings shall be based upon the estimated life 
        of the applicable equipment, consistent with the rating system 
        used to produce the energy efficiency report.
            (3) Present value of energy savings.--The present value of 
        the future savings shall be discounted using the average 
        interest rate on conventional 30-year mortgages, in the manner 
        directed by guidelines issued under subsection (a).

        whether a particular recreational use shall be allowed on the 
        land included in a priority list under this section.

        preparing the priority list under subsection (b), the Secretary
