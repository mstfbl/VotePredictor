        of appeals for any circuit wherein the project or proposed 
        project is located, or in the United States Court of Appeals 
        for the District of Columbia. Such petition shall be filed not 
        later than 30 days prior to such deadline. The court shall only 
        grant an extension if the agency or tribe demonstrates, based 
        on the record maintained under section 34, that it otherwise 
        complied with the requirements of section 34 and that complying 
        with the schedule set by the Commission would have prevented 
        the agency or tribe from complying with applicable Federal or 
        State law. If the court grants the extension, the court shall 
        set a reasonable schedule and deadline, not to exceed 90 days, 
        for the agency to act on remand. If the court denies the 
        extension, or if an agency or tribe does not file for an 
        extension as provided in this subsection and does not complete 
        its disposition of a Federal authorization by the applicable 
        deadline, the Commission and applicant may move forward with 
        the proposed action.''.

        number of open-source methodologies and tools applicable across 
        a wide array of projects, including water balance models and 
        streamflow analyses.

applicants. Any study conducted under this subsection shall apply only 
to a project with respect to which the applicant participates.''.

                TITLE II--ENERGY SECURITY AND DIPLOMACY

SEC. 2001. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) North America's energy revolution has significantly 
        enhanced energy security in the United States, and 
        fundamentally changed the Nation's energy future from that of 
        scarcity to abundance.
            (2) North America's energy abundance has increased global 
        energy supplies and reduced the price of energy for consumers 
        in the United States and abroad.
            (3) Allies and trading partners of the United States, 
        including in Europe and Asia, are seeking stable and affordable 
        energy supplies from North America to enhance their energy 
        security.
            (4) The United States has an opportunity to improve its 
        energy security and promote greater stability and affordability 
        of energy supplies for its allies and trading partners through 
        a more integrated, secure, and competitive North American 
        energy system.
            (5) The United States also has an opportunity to promote 
        such objectives by supporting the free flow of energy 
        commodities and more open, transparent, and competitive global 
        energy markets, and through greater Federal agency coordination 
        relating to regulations or agency actions that significantly 
        affect the supply, distribution, or use of energy.

SEC. 2002. ENERGY SECURITY VALUATION.

    (a) Establishment of Energy Security Valuation Methods.--Not later

        procedures and criteria to ensure that energy-related actions 
        that significantly affect the supply, distribution, 
        transportation, or use of energy are evaluated with respect to 
        their potential impact on energy security, including their 
        impact on--
                    (A) consumers and the economy;

    (a) Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) acting pursuant to the requirements of section 
                325 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
                U.S.C. 6295), the Secretary of Energy is considering 
                amending the energy conservation standards applicable 
                to residential nonweatherized gas furnaces and mobile 
                home gas furnaces;
                    (B) numerous stakeholders, representing 
                manufacturers, distributors, and installers of 
                residential nonweatherized gas furnaces and mobile home 
                furnaces, natural gas utilities, home builders, 
                multifamily property owners, and energy efficiency, 
                environmental, and consumer advocates have begun 
                negotiations in an attempt to agree on a consensus 
                recommendation to the Secretary on levels for such 
                standards that will meet the statutory criteria; and
                    (C) the stakeholders believe these negotiations are 
                likely to result in a consensus recommendation, but 
                several of the stakeholders do not support suspending 
                the current rulemaking.
            (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to provide 
        the stakeholders described in paragraph (1) with an opportunity 
        to continue negotiations for a limited time period to 
        facilitate the proposal for adoption of standards that enjoy 
        consensus support, while not delaying the current rulemaking 
        except to the extent necessary to provide such opportunity.
    (b) Opportunity for a Negotiated Furnace Standard.--Section 
325(f)(4) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6295(f)(4)) is amended by adding after subparagraph (D) the following:
    ``(E)(i) Unless the Secretary has published such a notice prior to 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish, not 
later than October 31, 2015, a supplemental notice of proposed 
rulemaking or a notice of data availability updating the proposed rule 
entitled `Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products: Energy 
Conservation Standards for Residential Furnaces' and published in the 
Federal Register on March 12, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 13119), to provide 
notice and an opportunity for comment on--
            ``(I) dividing nonweatherized gas furnaces into two or more 
        product classes with separate energy conservation standards 
        based on capacity; and
            ``(II) any other matters the Secretary determines 
        appropriate.
    ``(ii) On receipt of a statement that is submitted on or before 
January 1, 2016, jointly by interested persons that are fairly 
representative of relevant points of view, that contains recommended 
standards for nonweatherized gas furnaces and mobile home gas furnaces 
that are consistent with the requirements of this part (except that the 
date on which such standards will apply may be earlier or later than 
the date required under this part), the Secretary shall evaluate the 
standards proposed in the joint statement for consistency with the 
requirements of subsection (o), and shall publish notice of the 
potential adoption of the standards proposed in the joint statement, 
modified as necessary to ensure consistency with subsection (o). The 
Secretary shall solicit public comment for a period of at least 30 days 
with respect to such notice.
    ``(iii) Not later than July 31, 2016, but not before July 1, 2016, 
the Secretary shall publish a final rule containing a determination of 
whether the standards for nonweatherized gas furnaces and mobile home 
gas furnaces should be amended. Such rule shall contain any such 
amendments to the standards.''.

SEC. 3124. NO WARRANTY FOR CERTAIN CERTIFIED ENERGY STAR PRODUCTS.

    Section 324A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6294a) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) No Warranty.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any disclosure relating to participation 
        of a product in the Energy Star program shall not create an 
        express or implied warranty or give rise to any private claims 
        or rights of action under State or Federal law relating to the 
        disqualification of that product from Energy Star if--
                    ``(A) the product has been certified by a 
                certification body recognized by the Energy Star 
                program;

                measures, including a determination of whether or not 
                consumer compensation is appropriate; and
                    ``(C) the responsible party has fully complied with 
                all approved corrective measures.
            ``(2) Construal.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed to require the Administrator to modify any procedure 
        or take any other action.''.

SEC. 3125. CLARIFICATION TO EFFECTIVE DATE FOR REGIONAL STANDARDS.

    Section 325(o)(6)(E)(ii) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(6)(E)(ii)) is amended by striking ``installed'' and 
inserting ``manufactured or imported into the United States''.

SEC. 3126. INTERNET OF THINGS REPORT.

    The Secretary of Energy shall, not later than 18 months after the 
date of enactment of this Act, report to the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy

advantage of, and promote, the utilization of advanced technologies 
such as Internet of Things end-to-end platform solutions to provide 
real-time actionable analytics and enable predictive maintenance and 
asset management to improve energy efficiency wherever feasible. In 
doing so, the Secretary shall look to encourage and utilize Internet of 
Things energy management solutions that have security tightly 
integrated into the hardware and software from the outset. The 
Secretary shall also encourage the use of Internet of Things solutions 
that enable seamless connectivity and that are interoperable, open 
standards-based, and built on a repeatable foundation for ease of 
scalability.

SEC. 3127. ENERGY SAVINGS FROM LUBRICATING OIL.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the

        section 1838 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005;
            (2) after consultation with relevant Federal, State, and 
        local agencies and affected industry and stakeholder groups, 
        update data that was used in preparing that report; and
            (3) prepare and submit to Congress a coordinated Federal 
        strategy to increase the beneficial reuse of used lubricating 
        oil, that--
                    (A) is consistent with national policy as 
                established pursuant to section 2 of the Used Oil 
                Recycling Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-463); and
                    (B) addresses measures needed to--
                            (i) increase the responsible collection of 
                        used oil;
                            (ii) disseminate public information 
                        concerning sustainable reuse options for used 
                        oil; and
                            (iii) promote sustainable reuse of used oil 
                        by Federal agencies, recipients of Federal

             TITLE IV--CHANGING CRUDE OIL MARKET CONDITIONS

SEC. 4001. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy 
        production, establishing the United States as the world's 
        leading oil producer.
            (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur 
        domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help 
        maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is 
        essential to national defense, and generate State and Federal 
        revenues.
            (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter 
        of energy has the potential to transform the security 
        environment around the world, notably in Europe and the Middle 
        East.
            (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of 
        more United States oil in the market will offer more secure 
        supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic 
        alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political 
        weapon.
            (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element 
        of our military's strategic sealift and global response 
        capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United 
        States crews will be available to support the United States 
        military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and 
        is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and 
        projected sealift requirements for the United States.
            (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor 
        base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew the 
        United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well 
        as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace and war.
            (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over 
        the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy 
        technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, 
        reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national 
        security.

SEC. 4002. REPEAL.

        Interior shall develop and consider an additional alternative 
        that produces the greater of 500 million board feet or the 
        annual net growth on the acres classified as timberland, 
        excluding any congressionally reserved areas. The projected 
        harvest levels, as nearly as practicable, shall be distributed 
        among the Districts referred to in subsection (a) in the same 
        proportion as the maximum yield capacity of each such District 
        bears to maximum yield capacity of the planning area as a 
        whole.
    (d) Additional Analysis and Public Participation.--The Secretary of 
the Interior shall publish the reference analysis and additional 
alternatives and analyze their environmental and economic consequences 
in a supplemental draft environmental impact statement. The draft 
environmental impact statement and supplemental draft environmental 
impact statement shall be made available for public comment for a 
period of not less than 180 days. The Secretary shall respond to any 
comments received before making a final decision between all 
alternatives.

         TITLE I--WESTERN WATER AND AMERICAN FOOD SECURITY ACT

SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Western Water and American Food 
Security Act of 2015''.

SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) As established in the Proclamation of a State of 
        Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, 
        2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions.
            (2) Extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State 
        since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist 
        into the future.
            (3) The water supplies of the State are at record-low 
        levels, as indicated by the fact that all major Central Valley 
        Project reservoir levels were at 20-35 percent of capacity as 
        of September 25, 2014.
            (4) The lack of precipitation has been a significant 
        contributing factor to the 6,091 fires experienced in the State 
        as of September 15, 2014, and which covered nearly 400,000 
        acres.
            (5) According to a study released by the University of 
        California, Davis in July 2014, the drought has led to the 
        fallowing of 428,000 acres of farmland, loss of $810 million in 
        crop revenue, loss of $203 million in dairy and other livestock 
        value, and increased groundwater pumping costs by $454 million. 
        The statewide economic costs are estimated to be $2.2 billion, 
        with over 17,000 seasonal and part-time agricultural jobs lost.
            (6) CVPIA Level II water deliveries to refuges have also 
        been reduced by 25 percent in the north of Delta region, and by 
        35 percent in the south of Delta region.
            (7) Only one-sixth of the usual acres of rice fields are 
        being flooded this fall, which leads to a significant decline 
        in habitat for migratory birds and an increased risk of disease 
        at the remaining wetlands due to overcrowding of such birds.
            (8) The drought of 2013 through 2014 constitutes a serious 
        emergency that poses immediate and severe risks to human life 
        and safety and to the environment throughout the State.
            (9) The serious emergency described in paragraph (4) 
        requires--
                    (A) immediate and credible action that respects the 
                complexity of the water system of the State and the 
                importance of the water system to the entire State; and
                    (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against 
                one another, which history shows only leads to costly 
                litigation that benefits no one and prevents any real 
                solutions.
            (10) Data on the difference between water demand and 
        reliable water supplies for various regions of California south 
        of the Delta, including the San Joaquin Valley, indicate there 
        is a significant annual gap between reliable water supplies to 
        meet agricultural, municipal and industrial, groundwater, and 
        refuges water needs within the Delta Division, San Luis Unit 
        and Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and the State 
        Water Project south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta 
        and the demands of those areas. This gap varies depending on 
        the methodology of the analysis performed, but can be 
        represented in the following ways:
                    (A) For Central Valley Project South-of-Delta water 
                service contractors, if it is assumed that a water 
                supply deficit is the difference in the amount of water 
                available for allocation versus the maximum contract 
                quantity, then the water supply deficits that have 
                developed from 1992 to 2014 as a result of legislative 
                and regulatory changes besides natural variations in 
                hydrology during this timeframe range between 720,000 
                and 1,100,000 acre-feet.
                    (B) For Central Valley Project and State Water 
                Project water service contractors south of the Delta 
                and north of the Tehachapi mountain range, if it is 
                assumed that a water supply deficit is the difference 
                between reliable water supplies, including maximum 
                water contract deliveries, safe yield of groundwater, 
                safe yield of local and surface supplies and long-term 
                contracted water transfers, and water demands, 
                including water demands from agriculture, municipal and 
                industrial and refuge contractors, then the water 
                supply deficit ranges between approximately 2,500,000 
                to 2,700,000 acre-feet.
            (11) Data of pumping activities at the Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project delta pumps identifies that, on 
        average from Water Year 2009 to Water Year 2014, take of Delta 
        smelt is 80 percent less than allowable take levels under the 
        biological opinion issued December 15, 2008.
            (12) Data of field sampling activities of the Interagency 
        Ecological Program located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
        Estuary identifies that, on average from 2005 to 2013, the 
        program ``takes'' 3,500 delta smelt during annual surveys with 
        an authorized ``take'' level of 33,480 delta smelt annually--
        according to the biological opinion issued December 9, 1997.
            (13) In 2015, better information exists than was known in 
        2008 concerning conditions and operations that may or may not 
        lead to high salvage events that jeopardize the fish 
        populations, and what alternative management actions can be 
        taken to avoid jeopardy.
            (14) Alternative management strategies, removing non-native 
        species, enhancing habitat, monitoring fish movement and 
        location in real-time, and improving water quality in the Delta 
        can contribute significantly to protecting and recovering these 
        endangered fish species, and at potentially lower costs to 
        water supplies.
            (15) Resolution of fundamental policy questions concerning 
        the extent to which application of the Endangered Species Act 
        of 1973 affects the operation of the Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project is the responsibility of Congress.

    (a) Review and Modification.--Not later than October 1, 2016, and 
at least every five years thereafter, the Director, in cooperation with 
other Federal, State, and local agencies, shall use the best scientific 
and commercial data available to complete a review and, modify the 
method used to calculate the incidental take levels for adult and 
larval/juvenile Delta smelt in the smelt biological opinion that takes 
into account all life stages, among other considerations--
            (1) salvage information collected since at least 1993;

        salvage rates and historic water clarity and OMR flow during 
        the adult salvage period; and
            (4) set the incidental take level as the 80 percent upper 
        prediction interval derived from simulated salvage rates since 
        at least 1993.

SEC. 1013. FACTORING INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND UPDATED SCIENCE 
              INTO DELTA SMELT MANAGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Director shall use the best scientific and 
commercial data available to implement, continuously evaluate, and 
refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable and prudent alternative 
described in the smelt biological opinion, and any successor opinions 
or court order. The Secretary shall make all significant decisions 
under the smelt biological opinion, or any successor opinions that 
affect Central Valley Project and State Water Project operations, in 
writing, and shall document the significant facts upon which such 
decisions are made, consistent with section 706 of title 5, United 
States Code.
    (b) Increased Monitoring To Inform Real-Time Operations.--The 
Secretary shall conduct additional surveys, on an annual basis at the 
appropriate time of the year based on environmental conditions, in 
collaboration with other Delta science interests.
            (1) In implementing this section, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) use the most accurate survey methods available 
                for the detection of Delta smelt to determine the 
                extent that adult Delta smelt are distributed in 
                relation to certain levels of turbidity, or other 
                environmental factors that may influence salvage rate; 
                and
                    (B) use results from appropriate survey methods for 
                the detection of Delta smelt to determine how the 
                Central Valley Project and State Water Project may be 
                operated more efficiently to minimize salvage while 
                maximizing export pumping rates without causing a 
                significant negative impact on the long-term survival 
                of the Delta smelt.
            (2) During the period beginning on December 1, 2015, and 
        ending March 31, 2016, and in each successive December through 
        March period, if suspended sediment loads enter the Delta from 
        the Sacramento River and the suspended sediment loads appear 
        likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old River north of the 
        export pumps from values below 12 Nephelometric Turbidity Units 
        (NTU) to values above 12 NTU, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate 
                survey methods at locations including, but not limited 
                to, the vicinity of Station 902 to determine the extent 
                that adult Delta smelt are moving with turbidity toward 
                the export pumps; and
                    (B) use results from the monitoring surveys 
                referenced in paragraph (A) to determine how increased 
                trawling can inform daily real-time Central Valley 
                Project and State Water Project operations to minimize 
                salvage while maximizing export pumping rates without 
                causing a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt.
    (c) Periodic Review of Monitoring.--Within 12 months of the date of 
enactment of this title, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) evaluate whether the monitoring program under 
        subsection (b), combined with other monitoring programs for the 
        Delta, is providing sufficient data to inform Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project operations to minimize salvage 
        while maximizing export pumping rates without causing a 
        significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the 
        Delta smelt; and
            (2) determine whether the monitoring efforts should be 
        changed in the short or long term to provide more useful data.
    (d) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--
            (1) In general.--No later than January 1, 2016, and at 
        least every five years thereafter, the Secretary, in 
        collaboration with the California Department of Fish and 
        Wildlife, the California Department of Water Resources, public 
        water agencies, and other interested entities, shall implement 
        new targeted sampling and monitoring specifically designed to 
        understand Delta smelt abundance, distribution, and the types 
        of habitat occupied by Delta smelt during all life stages.
            (2) Sampling.--The Delta smelt distribution study shall, at 
        a minimum--
                    (A) include recording water quality and tidal data;
                    (B) be designed to understand Delta smelt 
                abundance, distribution, habitat use, and movement 
                throughout the Delta, Suisun Marsh, and other areas 
                occupied by the Delta smelt during all seasons;
                    (C) consider areas not routinely sampled by 
                existing monitoring programs, including wetland 
                channels, near-shore water, depths below 35 feet, and 
                shallow water; and
                    (D) use survey methods, including sampling gear, 
                best suited to collect the most accurate data for the 
                type of sampling or monitoring.
    (e) Scientifically Supported Implementation of OMR Flow 
Requirements.--In implementing the provisions of the smelt biological 
opinion, or any successor biological opinion or court order, pertaining 
to management of reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) consider the relevant provisions of the biological 
        opinion or any successor biological opinion;
            (2) to maximize Central Valley project and State Water 
        Project water supplies, manage export pumping rates to achieve 
        a reverse OMR flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second unless 
        information developed by the Secretary under paragraphs (3) and 
        (4) leads the Secretary to reasonably conclude that a less 
        negative OMR flow rate is necessary to avoid a negative impact 
        on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt. If information 
        available to the Secretary indicates that a reverse OMR flow 
        rate more negative than -5,000 cubic feet per second can be 
        established without an imminent negative impact on the long-
        term survival of the Delta smelt, the Secretary shall manage 
        export pumping rates to achieve that more negative OMR flow 
        rate;
            (3) document in writing any significant facts about real-
        time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse 
        flow rates, including--
                    (A) whether targeted real-time fish monitoring in 
                the Old River pursuant to this section, including 
                monitoring in the vicinity of Station 902, indicates 
                that a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt is imminent; and
                    (B) whether near-term forecasts with available 
                salvage models show under prevailing conditions that 
                OMR flow of -5,000 cubic feet per second or higher will 
                cause a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt;
            (4) show in writing that any determination to manage OMR 
        reverse flow at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet per 
        second is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on 
        the long-term survival of the Delta smelt, including an 
        explanation of the data examined and the connection between 
        those data and the choice made, after considering--
                    (A) the distribution of Delta smelt throughout the 
                Delta;
                    (B) the potential effects of documented, quantified 
                entrainment on subsequent Delta smelt abundance;
                    (C) the water temperature;
                    (D) other significant factors relevant to the 
                determination; and
                    (E) whether any alternative measures could have a 
                substantially lesser water supply impact; and
            (5) for any subsequent biological opinion, make the showing 
        required in paragraph (4) for any determination to manage OMR 
        reverse flow at rates less negative than the most negative 
        limit in the biological opinion if the most negative limit in 
        the biological opinion is more negative than -5,000 cubic feet 
        per second.
    (f) Memorandum of Understanding.--No later than December 1, 2015, 
the Commissioner and the Director will execute a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) to ensure that the smelt biological opinion is 
implemented in a manner that maximizes water supply while complying 
with applicable laws and regulations. If that MOU alters any procedures 
set out in the biological opinion, there will be no need to reinitiate 
consultation if those changes will not have a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival on listed species and the 
implementation of the MOU would not be a major change to implementation 
of the biological opinion. Any change to procedures that does not 
create a significant negative impact on the long-term survival to 
listed species will not alter application of the take permitted by the 
incidental take statement in the biological opinion under section 
7(o)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
    (g) Calculation of Reverse Flow in OMR.--Within 90 days of the 
enactment of this title, the Secretary is directed, in consultation 
with the California Department of Water Resources to revise the method 
used to calculate reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers for 
implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the smelt 
biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, and any 
succeeding biological opinions, for the purpose of increasing Central 
Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies. The method of 
calculating reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers shall be reevaluated 
not less than every five years thereafter to achieve maximum export 
pumping rates within limits established by the smelt biological 
opinion, the salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding biological 
opinions.

SEC. 1022. PROCESS FOR ENSURING SALMONID MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO 
              NEW SCIENCE.

    (a) General Directive.--The reasonable and prudent alternative 
described in the salmonid biological opinion allows for and anticipates 
adjustments in Central Valley Project and State Water Project operation 
parameters to reflect the best scientific and commercial data currently 
available, and authorizes efforts to test and evaluate improvements in 
operations that will meet applicable regulatory requirements and 
maximize Central Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies 
and reliability. Implementation of the reasonable and prudent 
alternative described in the salmonid biological opinion shall be 
adjusted accordingly as new scientific and commercial data are 
developed. The Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator shall fully 
utilize these authorities as described below.
    (b) Annual Reviews of Certain Central Valley Project and State 
Water Project Operations.--No later than December 31, 2016, and at 
least annually thereafter:
            (1) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant 
        Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments to the 
        initiation of Action IV.2.3 as set forth in the Biological 
        Opinion and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of 
        the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, Endangered 
        Species Act Section 7 Consultation, issued by the National 
        Marine Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, pertaining to 
        negative OMR flows, subject to paragraph (5).
            (2) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant 
        Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments in the 
        timing, triggers or other operational details relating to the 
        implementation of pumping restrictions in Action IV.2.1 
        pertaining to the inflow to export ratio, subject to paragraph 
        (5).
            (3) Pursuant to the consultation and assessments carried 
        out under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the 
        Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator shall jointly make 
        recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior and to the 
        Secretary on adjustments to project operations that, in the 
        exercise of the adaptive management provisions of the salmonid 
        biological opinion, will reduce water supply impacts of the 
        salmonid biological opinion on the Central Valley Project and 
        the California State Water Project and are consistent with the 
        requirements of applicable law and as further described in 
        subsection (c).
            (4) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall 
        direct the Commissioner and Assistant Administrator to 
        implement recommended adjustments to Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project operations for which the conditions under 
        subsection (c) are met.
            (5) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall 
        review and identify adjustments to Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project operations with water supply restrictions 
        in any successor biological opinion to the salmonid biological 
        opinion, applying the provisions of this section to those water 
        supply restrictions where there are references to Actions 
        IV.2.1 and IV.2.3.
    (c) Implementation of Operational Adjustments.--After reviewing the 
recommendations under subsection (b), the Secretary of the Interior and 
the Secretary shall direct the Commissioner and the Assistant 
Administrator to implement those operational adjustments, or any 
combination, for which, in aggregate--
            (1) the net effect on listed species is equivalent to those 
        of the underlying project operational parameters in the 
        salmonid biological opinion, taking into account both--
                    (A) efforts to minimize the adverse effects of the 
                adjustment to project operations; and
                    (B) whatever additional actions or measures may be 
                implemented in conjunction with the adjustments to 
                operations to offset the adverse effects to listed 
                species, consistent with (d), that are in excess of the 
                adverse effects of the underlying operational 
                parameters, if any; and
            (2) the effects of the adjustment can be reasonably 
        expected to fall within the incidental take authorizations.
    (d) Evaluation of Offsetting Measures.--When examining and 
identifying opportunities to offset the potential adverse effect of 
adjustments to operations under subsection (c)(1)(B), the Commissioner 
and the Assistant Administrator shall take into account the potential 
species survival improvements that are likely to result from other 
measures which, if implemented in conjunction with such adjustments, 
would offset adverse effects, if any, of the adjustments. When 
evaluating offsetting measures, the Commissioner and the Assistant 
Administrator shall consider the type, timing and nature of the adverse 
effects, if any, to specific species and ensure that the measures 
likely provide equivalent overall benefits to the listed species in the 
aggregate, as long as the change will not cause a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.
    (e) Framework for Examining Opportunities To Minimize or Offset the 
Potential Adverse Effect of Adjustments to Operations.--Not later than 
December 31, 2015, and every five years thereafter, the Assistant 
Administrator shall, in collaboration with the Director of the 
California Department of Fish and Wildlife, based on the best 
scientific and commercial data available and for each listed salmonid 
species, issue estimates of the increase in through-Delta survival the 
Secretary expects to be achieved--
            (1) through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
        specified by Action IV.2.3 as compared to limiting OMR flow to 
        a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the time 
        period Action IV.2.3 is applicable, based on a given rate of 
        San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and holding other 
        relevant factors constant;
            (2) through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions 
        on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1 as 
        compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed by 
        the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641, based 
        on a given rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and 
        holding other relevant factors constant;
            (3) through physical habitat restoration improvements;
            (4) through predation control programs;
            (5) through the installation of temporary barriers, the 
        management of Cross Channel Gates operations, and other 
        projects affecting flow in the Delta;
            (6) through salvaging fish that have been entrained near 
        the entrance to Clifton Court Forebay;
            (7) through any other management measures that may provide 
        equivalent or better protections for listed species while 
        maximizing export pumping rates without causing a significant 
        negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid 
        species; and
            (8) through development and implementation of conservation 
        hatchery programs for salmon and steelhead to aid in the 
        recovery of listed salmon and steelhead species.
    (f) Survival Estimates.--
            (1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Assistant 
        Administrator shall make quantitative estimates of survival 
        such as a range of percentage increases in through-Delta 
        survival that could result from the management measures, and if 
        the scientific information is lacking for quantitative 
        estimates, shall do so on qualitative terms based upon the best 
        available science.
            (2) If the Assistant Administrator provides qualitative 
        survival estimates for a species resulting from one or more 
        management measures, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent 
        feasible, rank the management measures described in subsection 
        (e) in terms of their most likely expected contribution to 
        increased through-Delta survival relative to the other 
        measures.
            (3) If at the time the Assistant Administrator conducts the 
        reviews under subsection (b), the Secretary has not issued an 
        estimate of increased through-Delta survival from different 
        management measures pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary 
        shall compare the protections to the species from different 
        management measures based on the best scientific and commercial 
        data available at the time.
    (g) Comparison of Adverse Consequences for Alternative Management 
Measures of Equivalent Protection for a Species.--
            (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection 
        (c)--
                    (A) the alternative management measure or 
                combination of alternative management measures 
                identified in paragraph (2) shall be known as the 
                ``equivalent alternative measure'';
                    (B) the existing measure or measures identified in 
                subparagraphs (2) (A), (B), (C), or (D) shall be known 
                as the ``equivalent existing measure''; and
                    (C) an ``equivalent increase in through-Delta 
                survival rates for listed salmonid species'' shall mean 
                an increase in through-Delta survival rates that is 
                equivalent when considering the change in through-Delta 
                survival rates for the listed salmonid species in the 
                aggregate, and not the same change for each individual 
                species, as long as the change in survival rates will 
                not cause a significant negative impact on the long-
                term survival of a listed salmonid species.
            (2) As part of the reviews of project operations pursuant 
        to subsection (b), the Assistant Administrator shall determine 
        whether any alternative management measures or combination of 
        alternative management measures listed in subsection (e) (3) 
        through (8) would provide an increase in through-Delta survival 
        rates for listed salmonid species that is equivalent to the 
        increase in through-Delta survival rates for listed salmonid 
        species from the following:
                    (A) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
                specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to limiting OMR 
                flow to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second 
                within the time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable.
                    (B) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
                specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to a 
                modification of Action IV.2.3 that would provide 
                additional water supplies, other than that described in 
                subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export 
                restrictions on export pumping rates specified within 
                Action IV.2.1, as compared to the restrictions in the 
                April/May period imposed by the State Water Resources 
                Control Board decision D-1641.
                    (D) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export 
                restrictions on export pumping rates specified within 
                Action IV.2.1, as compared to a modification of Action 
                IV.2.1 that would reduce water supply impacts of the 
                salmonid biological opinion on the Central Valley 
                Project and the California State Water Project, other 
                than that described in subparagraph (C).
            (3) If the Assistant Administrator identifies an equivalent 
        alternative measure pursuant to paragraph (2), the Assistant 
        Administrator shall determine whether--
                    (A) it is technically feasible and within Federal 
                jurisdiction to implement the equivalent alternative 
                measure;
                    (B) the State of California, or subdivision 
                thereof, or local agency with jurisdiction has 
                certified in writing within 10 calendar days to the 
                Assistant Administrator that it has the authority and 
                capability to implement the pertinent equivalent 
                alternative measure; or
                    (C) the adverse consequences of doing so are less 
                than the adverse consequences of the equivalent 
                existing measure, including a concise evaluation of the 
                adverse consequences to other affected interests.
            (4) If the Assistant Administrator makes the determinations 
        in subparagraph (3)(A) or (3)(B), the Commissioner shall adjust 
        project operations to implement the equivalent alternative 
        measure in place of the equivalent existing measure in order to 
        increase export rates of pumping to the greatest extent 
        possible while maintaining a net combined effect of equivalent 
        through-Delta survival rates for the listed salmonid species.
    (h) Tracking Adverse Effects Beyond the Range of Effects Accounted 
for in the Salmonid Biological Opinion and Coordinated Operation With 
the Delta Smelt Biological Opinion.--
            (1) Among the adjustments to the project operations 
        considered through the adaptive management process under this 
        section, the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner 
        shall--
                    (A) evaluate the effects on listed salmonid species 
                and water supply of the potential adjustment to 
                operational criteria described in subparagraph (B); and
                    (B) consider requiring that before some or all of 
                the provisions of Actions IV.2.1. or IV.2.3 are imposed 
                in any specific instance, the Assistant Administrator 
                show that the implementation of these provisions in 
                that specific instance is necessary to avoid a 
                significant negative impact on the long-term survival 
                of a listed salmonid species.
            (2) The Assistant Administrator, the Director, and the 
        Commissioner, in coordination with State officials as 
        appropriate, shall establish operational criteria to coordinate 
        management of OMR flows under the smelt and salmonid biological 
        opinions, in order to take advantage of opportunities to 
        provide additional water supplies from the coordinated 
        implementation of the biological opinions.
            (3) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall 
        document the effects of any adaptive management decisions 
        related to the coordinated operation of the smelt and salmonid 
        biological opinions that prioritizes the maintenance of one 
        species at the expense of the other.
    (i) Real-Time Monitoring and Management.--Notwithstanding the 
calendar based triggers described in the salmonid biological opinion 
Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA), the Assistant Administrator 
and the Commissioner shall not limit OMR reverse flow to -5,000 cubic 
feet per second unless current monitoring data indicate that this OMR 
flow limitation is reasonably required to avoid a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.
    (j) Evaluation and Implementation of Management Measures.--If the 
quantitative estimates of through-Delta survival established by the 
Secretary for the adjustments in subsection (b)(2) exceed the through-
Delta survival established for the RPAs, the Secretary shall evaluate 
and implement the management measures in subsection (b)(2) as a 
prerequisite to implementing the RPAs contained in the Salmonid 
Biological Opinion.
    (k) Accordance With Other Law.--Consistent with section 706 of 
title 5, United States Code, decisions of the Assistant Administrator 
and the Commissioner described in subsections (b) through (j) shall be 
made in writing, on the basis of best scientific and commercial data 
currently available, and shall include an explanation of the data 
examined at the connection between those data and the decisions made.

SEC. 1023. NON-FEDERAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT NATIVE ANADROMOUS FISH IN THE 
              STANISLAUS RIVER.

    (a) Establishment of Nonnative Predator Fish Removal Program.--The 
Secretary and the districts, in consultation with the Director, shall 
jointly develop and conduct a nonnative predator fish removal program 
to remove nonnative striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, 
black bass, and other nonnative predator fish species from the 
Stanislaus River. The program shall--
            (1) be scientifically based;
            (2) include methods to quantify the number and size of 
        predator fish removed each year, the impact of such removal on 
        the overall abundance of predator fish, and the impact of such 
        removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish found in 
        the Stanislaus River by, among other things, evaluating the 
        number of juvenile anadromous fish that migrate past the rotary 
        screw trap located at Caswell;
            (3) among other methods, use wire fyke trapping, portable 
        resistance board weirs, and boat electrofishing; and
            (4) be implemented as quickly as possible following the 
        issuance of all necessary scientific research.
    (b) Management.--The management of the program shall be the joint 
responsibility of the Secretary and the districts. Such parties shall 
work collaboratively to ensure the performance of the program, and 
shall discuss and agree upon, among other things, changes in the 
structure, management, personnel, techniques, strategy, data 
collection, reporting, and conduct of the program.
    (c) Conduct.--
            (1) In general.--By agreement between the Secretary and the 
        districts, the program may be conducted by their own personnel, 
        qualified private contractors hired by the districts, personnel 
        of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service, or a combination thereof.
            (2) Participation by the national marine fisheries 
        service.--If the districts elect to conduct the program using 
        their own personnel or qualified private contractors hired by 
        them in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary may assign 
        an employee of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to the 
        National Marine Fisheries Service, to be present for all 
        activities performed in the field. Such presence shall ensure 
        compliance with the agreed-upon elements specified in 
        subsection (b). The districts shall pay the cost of such 
        participation in accordance with subsection (d).
            (3) Timing of election.--The districts shall notify the

        effects on species listed as threatened or endangered under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) due to 
        activities carried out pursuant this Act, as determined by the 
        Secretaries;
            (2) manage reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers at 
        -6,100 cubic feet per second if real-time monitoring indicates 
        that flows of -6,100 cubic feet per second or more negative can 
        be established for specific periods without causing a 
        significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the 
        Delta smelt, or if real-time monitoring does not support flows 
        of -6,100 cubic feet per second than manage OMR flows at -5,000 
        cubic feet per second subject to section 1013(e)(3) and (4); 
        and
            (3) use all available scientific tools to identify any 
        changes to real-time operations of the Bureau of Reclamation, 
        State, and local water projects that could result in the 
        availability of additional water supplies.

SEC. 1037. TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR FIRST FEW STORMS OF 
              THE WATER YEAR.

    (a) In General.--Consistent with avoiding a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival in the short term upon listed fish 
species beyond the range of those authorized under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 and other environmental protections under 
subsection (e), the Secretaries shall authorize the Central Valley 
Project and the State Water Project, combined, to operate at levels 
that result in negative OMR flows at -7,500 cubic feet per second 
(based on United States Geological Survey gauges on Old and Middle 
Rivers) daily average for 56 cumulative days after October 1 as 
described in subsection (c).
    (b) Days of Temporary Operational Flexibility.--The temporary 
operational flexibility described in subsection (a) shall be authorized 
on days that the California Department of Water Resources determines 
the daily average river flow of the Sacramento River is at, or above, 
17,000 cubic feet per second as measured at the Sacramento River at 
Freeport gauge maintained by the United States Geologic Survey.
    (c) Compliance With Endangered Species Act Authorizations.--In 
carrying out this section, the Secretaries may continue to impose any 
requirements under the smelt and salmonid biological opinions during 
any period of temporary operational flexibility as they determine are 
reasonably necessary to avoid an additional significant negative 
impacts on the long-term survival of a listed fish species beyond the 
range of those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
provided that the requirements imposed do not reduce water supplies 
available for the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.
    (d) Other Environmental Protections.--
            (1) State law.--The Secretaries' actions under this section 
        shall be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements 
        under State law.
            (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of 
        sediment out of the Delta in each water year, and provided that 
        such determination is based upon objective evidence, OMR flow 
        may be managed at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet 
        per second for a minimum duration to avoid movement of adult 
        Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) to areas in the southern 
        Delta that would be likely to increase entrainment at Central 
        Valley Project and State Water Project pumping plants.
            (3) Applicability of opinion.--This section shall not 
        affect the application of the salmonid biological opinion from 
        April 1 to May 31, unless the Secretary of Commerce finds that 
        some or all of such applicable requirements may be adjusted 
        during this time period to provide emergency water supply 
        relief without resulting in additional adverse effects beyond 
        those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In 
        addition to any other actions to benefit water supply, the 
        Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall 
        consider allowing through-Delta water transfers to occur during 
        this period if they can be accomplished consistent with section 
        3405(a)(1)(H) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. 
        Water transfers solely or exclusively through the State Water 
        Project are not required to be consistent with section 
        3405(a)(1)(H) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.
            (4) Monitoring.--During operations under this section, the 
        Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with the Fish and 
        Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and 
        California Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall undertake a 
        monitoring program and other data gathering to ensure 
        incidental take levels are not exceeded, and to identify

        species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
        U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).
    (e) Technical Adjustments to Target Period.--If, before temporary 
operational flexibility has been implemented on 56 cumulative days, the 
Secretaries operate the Central Valley Project and the State Water 
Project combined at levels that result in OMR flows less negative than 
-7,500 cubic feet per second during days of temporary operational 
flexibility as defined in subsection (c), the duration of such 
operation shall not be counted toward the 56 cumulative days specified 
in subsection (a).
    (f) Emergency Consultation; Effect on Running Averages.--
            (1) If necessary to implement the provisions of this 
        section, the Commissioner is authorized to take any action 
        necessary to implement this section for up to 56 cumulative 
        days. If during the 56 cumulative days the Commissioner 
        determines that actions necessary to implement this section 
        will exceed 56 days, the Commissioner shall use the emergency 
        consultation procedures under the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 and its implementing regulation at section 402.05 of title 
        50, Code of Federal Regulations, to temporarily adjust the 
        operating criteria under the biological opinions--
                    (A) solely for extending beyond the 56 cumulative 
                days for additional days of temporary operational 
                flexibility--
                            (i) no more than necessary to achieve the 
                        purposes of this section consistent with the 
                        environmental protections in subsections (d) 
                        and (e); and
                            (ii) including, as appropriate, adjustments 
                        to ensure that the actual flow rates during the 
                        periods of temporary operational flexibility do 
                        not count toward the 5-day and 14-day running 
                        averages of tidally filtered daily OMR flow 
                        requirements under the biological opinions, or
                    (B) for other adjustments to operating criteria or 
                to take other urgent actions to address water supply 
                shortages for the least amount of time or volume of 
                diversion necessary as determined by the Commissioner.
            (2) Following the conclusion of the 56 cumulative days of 
        temporary operational flexibility, or the extended number of 
        days covered by the emergency consultation procedures, the 
        Commissioner shall not reinitiate consultation on these 
        adjusted operations, and no mitigation shall be required, if 
        the effects on listed fish species of these operations under 
        this section remain within the range of those authorized under 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). If 
        the Commissioner reinitiates consultation, no mitigation 
        measures shall be required.
    (g) Level of Detail Required for Analysis.--In articulating the 
determinations required under this section, the Secretaries shall fully 
satisfy the requirements herein but shall not be expected to provide a 
greater level of supporting detail for the analysis than feasible to 
provide within the short timeframe permitted for timely decisionmaking 
in response to changing conditions in the Delta.

                                the ability of the agency to meet any 
                                requirements under Federal, State, or 
                                local law;

                                project, requires additional analysis 
                                for the agency to make a decision on 
                                the project application; or

                review and Bureau of Reclamation project delivery 
                activities at the earliest practicable time to avoid 
                delays and duplication of effort later in the process, 
                prevent potential conflicts, and ensure that planning 
                and project development decisions reflect environmental

        memoranda of agreement with the project sponsor, Indian tribes, 
        State and local governments, and other appropriate entities to 
        carry out the early coordination activities, including 
        providing technical assistance in identifying potential impacts 
        and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.

        authority that a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, 
        Indian tribe, or project sponsor has with respect to carrying

        paragraph (2) under mutually agreeable terms and conditions. 
        The manner of conversion under this paragraph shall be as 
        follows:
                    (A) Water service contracts that were entered into 
                under section 9(e) of the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 
                Stat. 1196), to be converted under this section shall

            (2) Prepayment.--Except for those repayment contracts under 
        which the contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment, 
        all repayment contracts under section 9(d) of that Act (53 
        Stat. 1195) in effect on the date of enactment of this Act at 
        the request of the contractor, and all contracts converted 
        pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) shall--
                    (A) provide for the repayment, either in lump sum 
                or by accelerated prepayment, of the remaining 
                construction costs identified in water project specific 
                irrigation rate repayment schedules, as adjusted to 
                reflect payment not reflected in such schedule, and 
                properly assignable for ultimate return by the 
                contractor, or if made in approximately equal 
                installments, no later than 3 years after the effective

                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days following receipt of request of the 
                contractor;
                    (B) require that construction costs or other

                capital costs to the contractors exercising contract 
                conversation under this subsection of less than 
                $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, 
                such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable 
                reclamation law;
                    (C) provide that power revenues will not be 
                available to aid in repayment of construction costs 
                allocated to irrigation under the contract; and

                project specific municipal and industrial rate 
                repayment schedules, as adjusted to reflect payments 
                not reflected in such schedule, and properly assignable 
                for ultimate return by the contractor. An estimate of 
                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days after receipt of request of contractor.

                effective date of the contract or not reflected in the 
                rate schedule referenced in subparagraph (A), and 
                properly assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid 
                in not more than 5 years after notification of the 
                allocation if such amount is a result of a collective 
                annual allocation of capital costs to the contractors 
                exercising contract conversation under this subsection 
                of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 
                or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by 
                applicable reclamation law.

                the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 Stat. 1195), and 
                applicable law.

        paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall--
                    (A) not be adjusted on the basis of the type of

                association;
                    (B) conform to any other agreements, such as

                relationships of the water users' association and their 
                landowners as provided under State law.
    (b) Accounting.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary of the Interior. In the event that the final cost allocation 
indicates that the costs properly assignable to the contractor are

            (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target 
        practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land 
        is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that land 
        have been closed to those activities;
            (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target 
        practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;
            (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal 
        land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including 
        continued population growth and development near former ranges;
            (4) providing opportunities for target practice and 
        marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and 
        non-Federal land can help--
                    (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, 
                and hunting activities; and
                    (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for 
                those activities;
            (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this 
        Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for 
        construction and expansion of public target ranges by making 
        available to States amounts that may be used for construction, 
        operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and
            (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased 
        Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion of 
        public target ranges.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to facilitate the 
construction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on 
Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land 
Management.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that 
        ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
        infringed''.
            (2) Section 327.13 of title 36, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, provides that, except in special circumstances, 
        ``possession of loaded firearms, ammunition, loaded projectile 
        firing devices, bows and arrows, crossbows, or other weapons is 
        prohibited'' at water resources development projects 
        administered by the Secretary of the Army.
            (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent 
        individuals complying with Federal and State laws from 
        exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while 
        at such water resources development projects.
            (4) The Federal laws should make it clear that the second 
        amendment rights of an individual at a water resources 
        development project should not be infringed.
    (b) Protecting the Right of Individuals To Bear Arms at Water 
Resources Development Projects.--The Secretary of the Army shall not 
promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from 
possessing a firearm, including an assembled or functional firearm, at 
a water resources development project covered under section 327.0 of

enactment of this Act), if--

        possessing the firearm; and
            (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the

Subtitle F--Recreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage Opportunities Act

SEC. 2061. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Recreational Fishing and 
Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act''.

SEC. 2062. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and 
        traditional activities in which millions of Americans 
        participate;
            (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue 
        to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and wildlife 
        management and conservation in the United States;
            (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally 
        acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be 
        provided on Federal lands and waters without adverse effects on 
        other uses or users;
            (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting 
        organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife 
        managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government as 
        well as State and local governments by investing volunteer time 
        and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;
            (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated 
        industries have generated billions of dollars of critical 
        funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and 
        management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing and 
        hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise taxes 
        on fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting equipment that 
        have generated billions of dollars of critical funding for fish 
        and wildlife conservation, research, and management;
            (6) recreational shooting is also an important and 
        traditional activity in which millions of Americans 
        participate;
            (7) safe recreational shooting is a valid use of Federal 
        lands, including the establishment of safe and convenient 
        recreational shooting ranges on such lands, and participation 
        in recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and 
        contributes to wildlife conservation;
            (8) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot 
        are declining, which depresses participation in these 
        traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely 
        impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for 
        important conservation efforts; and
            (9) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' 
        fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure 
        that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and 
        hunting on Federal land as recognized by Executive Order No. 
        12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive Order 
        No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage and 
        wildlife conservation.

        open for these activities or in the setting of levels of use 
        for these activities on Federal lands, unless the combination 
        or coordination of such opportunities would enhance the

        available to the public.
    (e) Federal Lands.--
            (1) Lands open.--Lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau

        shall be open to fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting 
        unless the managing Federal agency acts to close lands to such 
        activity. Lands may be subject to closures or restrictions if 
        determined by the head of the agency to be necessary and 
        reasonable and supported by facts and evidence, for purposes 
        including resource conservation, public safety, energy or 
        mineral production, energy generation or transmission 
        infrastructure, water supply facilities, protection of other 
        permittees, protection of private property rights or interest,

to'' Wilderness Purposes.--
            (1) Minimum requirements for administration.--The provision 
        of opportunities for fishing, hunting, and recreational 
        shooting, and the conservation of fish and wildlife to provide 
        sustainable use recreational opportunities on designated 
        Federal wilderness areas shall constitute measures necessary to 
        meet the minimum requirements for the administration of the 
        wilderness area, provided that this determination shall not 
        authorize or facilitate commodity development, use, or 
        extraction, motorized recreational access or use that is not 
        otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et 
        seq.), or permanent road construction or maintenance within 
        designated wilderness areas.
            (2) Application of wilderness act.--Provisions of the 
        Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), stipulating that 
        wilderness purposes are ``within and supplemental to'' the 
        purposes of the underlying Federal land unit are reaffirmed. 
        When seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation 
        programs and projects or provide fish and wildlife dependent 
        recreation opportunities on designated wilderness areas, each 
        Federal land management official shall implement these 
        supplemental purposes so as to facilitate, enhance, or both, 
        but not to impede the underlying Federal land purposes when 
        seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation programs 
        and projects or provide fish and wildlife dependent recreation 
        opportunities in designated wilderness areas, provided that 
        such implementation shall not authorize or facilitate commodity 
        development, use or extraction, or permanent road construction 
        or maintenance within designated wilderness areas.
    (g) No Priority.--Nothing in this section requires a Federal land 
management official to give preference to fishing, hunting, or 
recreational shooting over other uses of Federal land or over land or 
water management priorities established by Federal law.
    (h) Consultation With Councils.--In fulfilling the duties under 
this section, Federal land management officials shall consult with 
respective advisory councils as established in Executive Order Nos. 
12962 and 13443.
    (i) Authority of the States.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as interfering with, diminishing, or conflicting with the 
authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility of any State to exercise 
primary management, control, or regulation of fish and wildlife under 
State law (including regulations) on land or water within the State, 
including on Federal land.
    (j) Federal Licenses.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
to authorize a Federal land management official to require a license, 
fee, or permit to fish, hunt, or trap on land or water in a State, 
including on Federal land in the States, except that this subsection 
shall not affect the Migratory Bird Stamp requirement set forth in the 
Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C. 718 et 
seq.).

   TITLE III--NATIONAL STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS PRODUCTION ACT

SEC. 3001. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``National Strategic and Critical 
Minerals Production Act of 2015''.

SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The industrialization of developing nations has driven 
        demand for nonfuel minerals necessary for telecommunications, 
        military technologies, healthcare technologies, and 
        conventional and renewable energy technologies.
            (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are 
        essential for economic growth, national security, technological 
        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply 
        chain.
            (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and 
        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic 
        well-being, security, and general welfare of the Nation.
            (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is 
        becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these 
        mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:
                    (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was 
                dependent on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel mineral 
                materials, 8 of which the United States imported 100 
                percent of the Nation's requirements, and for another 
                19 commodities the United States imported more than 50 
                percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (B) By 2014 the United States import dependence for 
                nonfuel mineral materials increased from 45 to 65 
                commodities, 19 of which the United States imported for 
                100 percent of the Nation's requirements, and an 
                additional 24 of which the United States imported for 
                more than 50 percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (C) The United States share of worldwide mineral 
                exploration dollars was 7 percent in 2014, down from 19 
                percent in the early 1990s.
                    (D) In the 2014 Ranking of Countries for Mining 
                Investment (out of 25 major mining countries), found 
                that 7- to 10-year permitting delays are the most 
                significant risk to mining projects in the United 
                States.

                    (A) explain the rationale used in reaching its 
                determination;
                    (B) state the facts in the record that are the 
                basis for the determination; and
                    (C) show that the facts in the record could allow a 
                reasonable person to reach the same determination as 
                the lead agency did.
    (c) Coordination on Permitting Process.--The lead agency with 
responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall 
enhance government coordination for the permitting process by avoiding 
duplicative reviews, minimizing paperwork, and engaging other agencies 
and stakeholders early in the process. For purposes of this subsection, 
the lead agency shall consider the following practices:
            (1) Deferring to and relying upon baseline data, analyses 
        and reviews performed by State agencies with jurisdiction over 
        the proposed project.
            (2) Conducting any consultations or reviews concurrently 
        rather than sequentially to the extent practicable and when 
        such concurrent review will expedite rather than delay a 
        decision.
    (d) Memorandum of Agency Agreement.--If requested at any time by a 
State or local planning agency, the lead agency with responsibility for 
issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit, in consultation with

        System.

SEC. 3013. CONSERVATION OF THE RESOURCE.

    In evaluating and issuing any mineral exploration or mine permit, 
the priority of the lead agency shall be to maximize the development of 
the mineral resource, while mitigating environmental impacts, so that 
more of the mineral resource can be brought to the marketplace.

SEC. 3014. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING 
              PROJECTS.

    (a) Preparation of Federal Notices for Mineral Exploration and Mine 
Development Projects.--The preparation of Federal Register notices 
required by law associated with the issuance of a mineral exploration

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Staff Sergeant Sky Mote, USMC, grew up in El Dorado, 
        California.
            (2) Staff Sergeant Mote graduated from Union Mine High 
        School.
            (3) Upon graduation, Staff Sergeant Mote promptly enlisted 
        in the Marine Corps.
            (4) Staff Sergeant Mote spent 9 years serving his country 
        in the United States Marine Corps, including a deployment to 
        Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan.
            (5) By his decisive actions, heroic initiative, and 
        resolute dedication to duty, Staff Sergeant Mote gave his life 
        to protect fellow Marines on August 10, 2012, by gallantly 
        rushing into action during an attack by a rogue Afghan 
        policeman inside the base perimeter in Helmand province.
            (6) Staff Sergeant Mote was awarded the Navy Cross, a 
        Purple Heart, the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal, a Navy-
        Marine Corps Achievement Medal, two Combat Action Ribbons, and 
        three Good Conduct Medals.
            (7) The Congress of the United States, in acknowledgment of 
        this debt that cannot be repaid, honors Staff Sergeant Mote for 
        his ultimate sacrifice and recognizes his service to his 
        country, faithfully executed to his last, full measure of 
        devotion.
            (8) A presently unnamed peak in the center of Humphrey 
        Basin holds special meaning to the friends and family of Sky 
        Mote, as their annual hunting trips set up camp beneath this 
        point; under the stars, the memories made beneath this rounded 
        peak will be cherished forever.
