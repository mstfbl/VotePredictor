                into the agreement described in subparagraph (A) not 
                later than the latest date by which the Commission 
                considers reasonable for the National Academy of 
                Sciences to begin performing the services covered by 
                this subsection and complete them before the date

            (2) Study.--
                    (A) In general.--Under an agreement between the 
                Commission and the National Academy of Sciences under 
                this subsection, the National Academy of Sciences shall 
                conduct a study on matters concerning the lateral 
                stability and vehicle handling requirements proposed by 
                the Commission in a notice of proposed rulemaking 
                published in the Federal Register November 19, 2014 (79 
                Fed. Reg. 68964).
                    (B) Elements.--The study carried under subparagraph 
                (A) shall determine--
                            (i) the technical validity of the lateral 
                        stability and vehicle handling requirements 
                        described in subparagraph (A), for purposes of 
                        reducing the risk of ROV rollovers in the off-
                        road environment, including the repeatability 
                        and reproducibility of testing for compliance 
                        with such requirements;
                            (ii) the number of ROV rollovers that would 
                        be prevented if the proposed requirements were 
                        adopted;
                            (iii) whether there is a technical basis 
                        for the proposal to provide information on a 
                        point-of-sale hangtag about a vehicle's 
                        rollover resistance on a progressive scale; and
                            (iv) the effect on the utility of ROVs used 
                        by the Armed Forces if the proposed 
                        requirements were adopted.

                Secretary of Defense.
                    (D) Deadline and report.--In carrying out the study

                Sciences shall complete and transmit to the Commission 
                a report containing the findings of the study not later 
                than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this 
                Act.
            (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 5 days after 
        receiving the report described in paragraph (2)(D) from the 
        National Academy of Sciences, the Commission shall submit to 
        the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives such report, along with such comments as the 
        Commission may have concerning the report.
            (4) Consideration.--The Commission shall consider the 
        results of the study conducted under this subsection in any 
        subsequent rulemaking regarding the performance or 
        configuration of ROVs, or the provision of point-of-sale 
        information regarding ROV performance.
            (5) Alternate contract organization.--
                    (A) In general.--If the Commission is unable within 
                the period prescribed in paragraph (1)(B) to enter into 
                an agreement described in paragraph (1)(A) with the 
                National Academy of Sciences on terms acceptable to the 
                Commission, the Commission shall seek to enter into 
                such an agreement with another appropriate organization 
                that--

                    (B) Treatment.--If the Commission enters into an 
                agreement with another organization as described in 
                subparagraph (A), any reference in this section to the 
                National Academy of Sciences shall be treated as a
