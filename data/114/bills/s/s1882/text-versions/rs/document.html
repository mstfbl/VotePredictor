&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) On April 25, 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 
        on the Richter scale and a subsequent earthquake on May 12 
        measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale and numerous aftershocks--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) devastated Kathmandu, Nepal and the 
                surrounding areas;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) killed more than 8,700 
                people;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) injured hundreds of thousands 
                additional people;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) destroyed or damaged more than 770,000 
                homes, leaving the families who had been living in 
                those homes without shelter;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) damaged or destroyed more than 47,000 
                classrooms;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) damaged or destroyed over 1,000 health 
                facilities including primary health care centers and 
                birthing centers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) left many people with newly acquired 
                disabilities, including lost limbs and other physical 
                and mental trauma;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (H) severely impacted livelihoods and food 
                security for millions of people, including the 
                destruction of stockpiled grains and the loss of more 
                than 17,000 cattle and 40,000 smaller domesticated 
                animals; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) disrupted social structures and 
                families through death, injury, and 
                relocation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The earthquake devastated Nepal's 
        infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, 
        bridges, communications, and other facilities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) American citizens were also killed in the 
        widespread destruction caused by the earthquake.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Six American service members and 2 members of 
        the Nepalese Army lost their lives in a helicopter accident 
        while working to relieve the suffering of the Nepalese people 
        following the earthquake.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The World Bank and the Government of Nepal 
        conducted a post disaster needs assessment that estimated 
        almost $6,700,000,000 in sector specific damage, losses, and 
        recovery needs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) In Nepal, which is one of the poorest 
        countries in the world--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) an estimated 25 percent of the 
                population lives on less than $1.25 per day;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) there is a 46-percent unemployment 
                rate, with the majority of the population engaged in 
                subsistence agriculture;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) only 25 percent of Nepalese 
                participate in the formal banking system, with the 
                majority of Nepalese severely lacking access to credit 
                and financial services, making accessing credit for 
                rebuilding difficult; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) has one of the slowest economic growth 
                rates in the region.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Nepal bears a significant burden of national 
        debt, which hinders recovery.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Some of the investments created from loans to 
        Nepal were lost in the earthquake, but the country is still 
        obligated to pay off the loans.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) The geography of Nepal poses a significant 
        challenge to relief, reconstruction, and development that 
        requires extraordinary efforts and assets to 
        overcome.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) The United States Government, the Government 
        of Nepal, and civil society organizations have invested in 
        disaster risk reduction efforts for nearly 20 years. Those 
        efforts have reduced suffering and prevented greater loss of 
        life and property.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) In recent years, the Government and people of 
        Nepal have taken important steps forward to resolve civil 
        conflict, reconcile, and promote economic growth and 
        development.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) Nepal has qualified for the Millennium 
        Challenge Corporation Threshold Program and has been selected 
        for a Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, based on its 
        performance on key selection criteria.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) United States trade preference programs, 
        which extend duty-free tariff treatment, could accelerate 
        Nepal's efforts to reestablish economic growth.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (14) The earthquake has significantly increased 
        the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Nepal.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (15) A strong and unequivocal commitment from the 
        United States is needed--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) to help Nepal offset the costs of 
                doing business in Nepal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to preserve the gains made with United 
                States assistance; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) to encourage buyers and investors to 
                stand with Nepal through this crisis.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the policy of the United States, in partnership with 
the Government of Nepal and in coordination with the international 
community--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to support the sustainable recovery and 
        rebuilding of Nepal in a manner that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) encourages greater economic 
                growth;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) embraces the independence, resilience, 
                and democratic governance of Nepal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) supports collaboration with the 
                Government of Nepal and consultation with Nepalese and 
                international civil society and including the 
                participation of affected communities in planning and 
                implementing recovery and reconstruction;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) is transparent and equitably reaches 
                the most severely affected communities, particularly 
                those in hard-to-reach areas or who are otherwise 
                marginalized;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) dedicates significant resources to 
                addressing the vulnerability of young girls and boys 
                who are often at much higher risk of trafficking, 
                sexual exploitation, child labor, and other forms of 
                abuse during emergencies;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) prohibits the participation of the 
                United States in any construction effort, which uses 
                forced or child labor, unregistered recruitment 
                agencies, or pays wages through means other than 
                directly to the laborer or to their bank 
                account;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) promotes--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the utilization of full-time, 
                        Nepalese laborers that are paid not less than a 
                        living wage; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) compliance with Nepalese 
                        labor law and International Labor Organization 
                        core labor standards, including workplace 
                        health and safety;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (H) incorporates the potential of women 
                and men to contribute equally and to their maximum 
                efficiency;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) harnesses the energy of youth, who 
                make up 33 percent of Nepal's population, to rebuild 
                Nepal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (J) rebuilds in ways that foster 
                resilience to future earthquakes, landslides, and other 
                natural disasters that threaten Nepal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (K) enables a rapid return to school for 
                children, including the rapid construction and 
                effective utilization of medium term temporary school 
                structures; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (L) coordinates activities with the 
                Millennium Challenge Corporation and other agencies to 
                assure the optimal effectiveness of United States 
                efforts.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to strongly encourage the completion and 
        ratification of a new constitution that will serve as a strong 
        foundation for Nepal to build back the systems and 
        infrastructure even better than before the disaster;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) to encourage all international donors to 
        contribute and coordinate in a transparent manner and report 
        all contributions through international mechanisms to enable 
        the most efficient allocation of all reconstruction 
        resources;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) to ensure that previously ongoing development 
        investments in health, education, economic growth, food 
        security, and other areas continue, where appropriate, and are 
        not diverted to other purposes, and additional resources are 
        dedicated for earthquake recovery;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) to support debt relief for the Government of 
        Nepal in order to expand and hasten government-led 
        reconstruction;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) to affirm and build a long-term partnership 
        with Nepal in support of providing a foundation for economic 
        growth and sustainability through investments--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in essential infrastructure, including 
                transport, financial services, and energy;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to rebuild Nepal's competitiveness and 
                private sector in order to foster employment 
                generation, including policies to encourage investment 
                and open world consumer markets to Nepalese 
                exports;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) in food security and rural and 
                agricultural development, particularly of food staples 
                and other crops that provide economic growth and build 
                lasting food security; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) that recognize and address how 
                obstacles related to gender limit, hinder, or suppress 
                the economic productivity and gain of women;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) to reduce barriers to fast and effective 
        recovery and reconstruction including by limiting or 
        eliminating unnecessary importation duties or restrictions on 
        relief and recovery commodities that will be provided to 
        Nepalese in need and not sold;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) to ensure, with the Government of Nepal, that 
        affected children are protected from potential violence, abuse, 
        neglect, and exploitation and have the ability to access child 
        protection services, including psychosocial support;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) to support, in coordination with other 
        donors--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the institutional development and 
                capacity building of the Government of Nepal at the 
                national, local, and community levels so that the 
                Government of Nepal can ensure basic services for its 
                population, including health care, education, and other 
                basic social services;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) significant contributions to a 
                multilateral trust fund that will be established to 
                enhance the reconstruction and rebuilding of 
                Nepal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the Government and people of Nepal to 
                lead the vision for reconstruction and rebuilding of 
                Nepal; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) communities to fully participate in 
                the recovery and reconstruction process, by employing 
                local labor and consulting local leaders, affected 
                communities, and civil society for their experience and 
                vision;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) to address the stateless populations in Nepal 
        displaced by the earthquake including people who--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) are least likely to receive support 
                through the regular government systems; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) may have particularly greater 
                needs;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) to prioritize the provision of excess defense 
        articles, including small aircraft, to Nepal to assist in 
        search, relief, and rescue efforts related to earthquakes and 
        future humanitarian crises; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) to utilize every regulatory and 
        administrative flexibility available to minimize bureaucratic 
        requirements and expedite all relief and recovery 
        actions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Debt Relief for Nepal.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Cancellation of debt.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury should direct the United States Executive Director to 
        each international financial institution to advocate, by voice 
        and vote, in such institution--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the cancellation of any and all 
                remaining debt obligations of Nepal, including debt 
                obligations incurred after the date of the enactment of 
                this Act;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the provision of debt service relief 
                for all remaining payments of Nepal until the debt can 
                be cancelled; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) to the extent practicable, the 
                extension of any new assistance to Nepal primarily in 
                the form of grants instead of loans.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Securing other relief for nepal.--The 
        Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State should use 
        all appropriate diplomatic influence to secure the cancellation 
        of any and all remaining bilateral debt of Nepal.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Trust Fund for Infrastructure Investment.--The 
Secretary of the Treasury should support the creation and utilization 
of a World Bank trust fund for Nepal that would leverage potential 
United States contributions and promote bilateral donations to such a 
fund for the purpose of promoting transparency, donor coordination, and 
Nepalese ownership, and consultation with civil society, particularly 
when making investments in Nepal's infrastructure, such as--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) electric grids;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) roads;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) water and sanitation facilities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                particular focus on engineering and 
                construction.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On April 25, 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the 
        Richter scale and a subsequent earthquake on May 12 measuring 
        7.3 on the Richter scale and numerous aftershocks--
                    (A) devastated Kathmandu, Nepal and the surrounding 
                areas;
                    (B) killed more than 8,700 people;
                    (C) injured hundreds of thousands additional 
                people;
                    (D) destroyed or damaged more than 770,000 homes, 
                leaving the families who had been living in those homes 
                without shelter;
                    (E) damaged or destroyed more than 47,000 
                classrooms;
                    (F) damaged or destroyed over 1,000 health 
                facilities including primary health care centers and 
                birthing centers;
                    (G) left many people with newly acquired 
                disabilities, including lost limbs and other physical 
                and mental trauma;
                    (H) severely impacted livelihoods and food security 
                for millions of people, including the destruction of 
                stockpiled grains and the loss of more than 17,000 
                cattle and 40,000 smaller domesticated animals; and
                    (I) disrupted social structures and families 
                through death, injury, and relocation.
            (2) The earthquake devastated Nepal's infrastructure, 
        including homes, offices, factories, roads, bridges, 
        communications, and other facilities.
            (3) American citizens were also killed in the widespread 
        destruction caused by the earthquake.
            (4) Six American service members and 2 members of the 
        Nepalese Army lost their lives in a helicopter accident while 
        working to relieve the suffering of the Nepalese people 
        following the earthquake.
            (5) The World Bank and the Government of Nepal conducted a 
        post disaster needs assessment that estimated almost 
        $6,700,000,000 in sector specific damage, losses, and recovery 
        needs.
            (6) In Nepal, which is one of the poorest countries in the 
        world--
                    (A) an estimated 25 percent of the population lives 
                on less than $1.25 per day;
                    (B) there is a 46 percent unemployment rate, with 
                the majority of the population engaged in subsistence 
                agriculture;
                    (C) only 25 percent of Nepalese participate in the 
                formal banking system, with the majority of Nepalese 
                severely lacking access to credit and financial 
                services, making accessing credit for rebuilding 
                difficult; and
                    (D) has 1 of the slowest economic growth rates in 
                the region.
            (7) The geography of Nepal poses a significant challenge to 
        relief, reconstruction, and development that requires 
        extraordinary efforts and assets to overcome.
            (8) The United States Government, the Government of Nepal, 
        and civil society organizations have invested in disaster risk 
        reduction efforts for nearly 20 years. Those efforts have 
        reduced suffering and prevented greater loss of life and 
        property.
            (9) In recent years, the Government and people of Nepal 
        have taken important steps forward to resolve civil conflict, 
        reconcile, and promote economic growth and development.
            (10) Nepal has qualified for the Millennium Challenge 
        Corporation Threshold Program and has been selected for a 
        Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, based on its 
        performance on key selection criteria.
            (11) The earthquake has significantly increased the costs 
        and uncertainty of doing business in Nepal.
