                <DELETED>    (H) severely impacted livelihoods and food 
                security for millions of people, including the 
                destruction of stockpiled grains and the loss of more 
                than 17,000 cattle and 40,000 smaller domesticated 
                animals; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (I) disrupted social structures and 
                families through death, injury, and 
                relocation.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) The earthquake devastated Nepal's 
        infrastructure, including homes, offices, factories, roads, 
        bridges, communications, and other facilities.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) American citizens were also killed in the 
        widespread destruction caused by the earthquake.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Six American service members and 2 members of 
        the Nepalese Army lost their lives in a helicopter accident 
        while working to relieve the suffering of the Nepalese people 
        following the earthquake.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) The World Bank and the Government of Nepal 
        conducted a post disaster needs assessment that estimated 
        almost $6,700,000,000 in sector specific damage, losses, and 
        recovery needs.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) In Nepal, which is one of the poorest

                <DELETED>    (C) only 25 percent of Nepalese 
                participate in the formal banking system, with the 
                majority of Nepalese severely lacking access to credit 
                and financial services, making accessing credit for 
                rebuilding difficult; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (D) has one of the slowest economic growth 
                rates in the region.</DELETED>

        debt, which hinders recovery.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) Some of the investments created from loans to 
        Nepal were lost in the earthquake, but the country is still 
        obligated to pay off the loans.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) The geography of Nepal poses a significant 
        challenge to relief, reconstruction, and development that 
        requires extraordinary efforts and assets to 
        overcome.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) The United States Government, the Government 
        of Nepal, and civil society organizations have invested in 
        disaster risk reduction efforts for nearly 20 years. Those 
        efforts have reduced suffering and prevented greater loss of 
        life and property.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) In recent years, the Government and people of 
        Nepal have taken important steps forward to resolve civil

        development.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) Nepal has qualified for the Millennium 
        Challenge Corporation Threshold Program and has been selected 
        for a Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, based on its 
        performance on key selection criteria.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (13) United States trade preference programs, 
        which extend duty-free tariff treatment, could accelerate 
        Nepal's efforts to reestablish economic growth.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (14) The earthquake has significantly increased 
        the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Nepal.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (15) A strong and unequivocal commitment from the 
        United States is needed--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) to help Nepal offset the costs of 
                doing business in Nepal;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) to preserve the gains made with United 
                States assistance; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) to encourage buyers and investors to 
                stand with Nepal through this crisis.</DELETED>

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On April 25, 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the 
        Richter scale and a subsequent earthquake on May 12 measuring 
        7.3 on the Richter scale and numerous aftershocks--
                    (A) devastated Kathmandu, Nepal and the surrounding 
                areas;
                    (B) killed more than 8,700 people;
                    (C) injured hundreds of thousands additional 
                people;
                    (D) destroyed or damaged more than 770,000 homes, 
                leaving the families who had been living in those homes 
                without shelter;
                    (E) damaged or destroyed more than 47,000 
                classrooms;
                    (F) damaged or destroyed over 1,000 health 
                facilities including primary health care centers and 
                birthing centers;
                    (G) left many people with newly acquired 
                disabilities, including lost limbs and other physical 
                and mental trauma;
                    (H) severely impacted livelihoods and food security 
                for millions of people, including the destruction of 
                stockpiled grains and the loss of more than 17,000 
                cattle and 40,000 smaller domesticated animals; and
                    (I) disrupted social structures and families 
                through death, injury, and relocation.
            (2) The earthquake devastated Nepal's infrastructure, 
        including homes, offices, factories, roads, bridges, 
        communications, and other facilities.
            (3) American citizens were also killed in the widespread 
        destruction caused by the earthquake.
            (4) Six American service members and 2 members of the 
        Nepalese Army lost their lives in a helicopter accident while 
        working to relieve the suffering of the Nepalese people 
        following the earthquake.
            (5) The World Bank and the Government of Nepal conducted a 
        post disaster needs assessment that estimated almost 
        $6,700,000,000 in sector specific damage, losses, and recovery 
        needs.
            (6) In Nepal, which is one of the poorest countries in the 
        world--
                    (A) an estimated 25 percent of the population lives 
                on less than $1.25 per day;
                    (B) there is a 46 percent unemployment rate, with 
                the majority of the population engaged in subsistence 
                agriculture;
                    (C) only 25 percent of Nepalese participate in the 
                formal banking system, with the majority of Nepalese 
                severely lacking access to credit and financial 
                services, making accessing credit for rebuilding 
                difficult; and
                    (D) has 1 of the slowest economic growth rates in 
                the region.
            (7) The geography of Nepal poses a significant challenge to 
        relief, reconstruction, and development that requires 
        extraordinary efforts and assets to overcome.
            (8) The United States Government, the Government of Nepal, 
        and civil society organizations have invested in disaster risk 
        reduction efforts for nearly 20 years. Those efforts have 
        reduced suffering and prevented greater loss of life and 
        property.
            (9) In recent years, the Government and people of Nepal 
        have taken important steps forward to resolve civil conflict, 
        reconcile, and promote economic growth and development.
            (10) Nepal has qualified for the Millennium Challenge 
        Corporation Threshold Program and has been selected for a 
        Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, based on its 
        performance on key selection criteria.
            (11) The earthquake has significantly increased the costs 
        and uncertainty of doing business in Nepal.
