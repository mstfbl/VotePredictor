&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 101. REAFFIRMATION OF MERIT-BASED PEER REVIEW.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Foundation's intellectual merit and 
        broader impacts criteria remain appropriate for evaluating 
        grant proposals, as concluded by the 2011 National Science

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) evaluating proposals on the basis of the 
        Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria 
        assures that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) proposals funded by the Foundation are 
                of high quality and advance scientific knowledge; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the Foundation's overall funding 
                portfolio addresses societal needs through research 
                findings or through related activities; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) as evidenced by the Foundation's contributions 
        to scientific advancement, economic development, human health, 
        and national security, its peer review and merit review 
        processes have successfully identified and funded 
        scientifically and societally relevant research and should be 
        preserved.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Merit Review Criteria.--The Foundation shall maintain 
the intellectual merit and broader impacts criteria, among other 
specific criteria as appropriate, as the basis for evaluating grant 
proposals in the merit review process.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the Foundation has 
improved transparency and accountability of the outcomes made through

                Federal funds that will be expended, including by--
                &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) describing how the project--
                        &lt;/DELETED&gt;

        Congress a report on the examination, including any 
        recommendations for how to further improve transparency and 
        accountability of the outcomes made through the merit review

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) by striking ``The National'' and 
                inserting ``the National''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) by striking ``education,'' and 
                inserting ``education'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``with 27 
        States'' and all that follows through the semicolon at the end 
        and inserting ``with 28 States and jurisdictions, taken 
        together, receiving only about 12 percent of all National 
        Science Foundation research funding;'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(3) each of the States described in paragraph 
        (2) receives only a fraction of 1 percent of the Foundation's 
        research dollars each year;''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(4) first established at the National Science 
        Foundation in 1979, the Experimental Program to Stimulate 
        Competitive Research (referred to in this section as `EPSCoR') 
        assists States and jurisdictions historically underserved by 
        Federal research and development funding in strengthening their 
        research and innovation capabilities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(5) the EPSCoR structure requires each 
        participating State to develop a science and technology plan 
        suited to State and local research, education, and economic 
        interests and objectives;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(6) EPSCoR has been credited with advancing the 
        research competitiveness of participating States, improving 
        awareness of science, promoting policies that link scientific 
        investment and economic growth, and encouraging partnerships 
        between government, industry, and academia;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(7) EPSCoR proposals are evaluated through a 
        rigorous and competitive merit review process to ensure that 
        awarded research and development efforts meet high scientific 
        standards; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(8) according to the National Academy of 
        Sciences, EPSCoR has strengthened the national research 
        infrastructure and enhanced the educational opportunities 
        needed to develop the science and engineering 
        workforce.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--It is the sense of Congress 
        that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) since maintaining the Nation's 
                scientific and economic leadership requires the 
                participation of talented individuals nationwide, 
                EPSCoR investments into State research and education 
                capacities are in the Federal interest and should be 
                sustained; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) EPSCoR should maintain its 
                experimental component by supporting innovative methods 
                for improving research capacity and 
                competitiveness.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Definition of epscor.--In this subsection, the 
        term ``EPSCoR'' has the meaning given the term in section 502 
        of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 
        1862p note).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Award Structure Updates.--Section 517 of the America 
COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 1862p-9) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(g) Award Structure Updates.--In implementing the 
mandate to maximize the impact of Federal EPSCoR support on building 
competitive research infrastructure, and based on the inputs and 
recommendations of previous EPSCoR reviews, the head of each Federal 
agency administering an EPSCoR program shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) consider modifications to EPSCoR proposal 
        solicitation, award type, and project evaluation--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) to more closely align with current 
                agency priorities and initiatives;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                EPSCoR-funded researchers and agency staff, including 
                by providing opportunities for mentoring young

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 110. NSF MID-SCALE PROJECT INVESTMENTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Foundation funds major research 
        facilities, infrastructure, and instrumentation that provide 
        unique capabilities at the frontiers of science and 
        engineering.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Modern and effective research infrastructure 
        is critical to maintaining United States leadership in science 
        and engineering.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Many proposed instruments, equipment, or 
        upgrades to major research facilities fall between programs 
        currently funded by the Foundation, creating a gap between 
        Major Research Instrumentation and Major Research Equipment and 
        Facilities Construction, including projects that have been 
        identified as cost-effective additions of high priority to the 
        advancement of scientific understanding.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The 2010 Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal 
        Survey recommended a vigorous mid-scale innovations 
        program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the addition of a competitive mid-scale funding opportunity that 
includes both research, instrument, and infrastructure is essential to 
the portfolio of the Foundation and advancing scientific 
understanding.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Mid-Scale Projects.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Foundation shall evaluate the 
        existing and future needs, across all disciplines supported by 
        the Foundation, for mid-scale projects.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Strategy.--The Director of the Foundation 
        shall develop a strategy to meet the needs identified in 
        paragraph (1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Briefing.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Foundation 
        shall provide a briefing to the appropriate committees of 
        Congress on the evaluation under paragraph (1) and the strategy 
        under paragraph (2).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Definition of mid-scale projects.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``mid-scale projects'' means research, 
        instrumentation, and infrastructure investments that fall 
        between the instrumentation funded by the major research 
        instrumentation program and the very large projects funded by 
        the major research equipment and facilities construction 
        program as described in section 507 of the AMERICA Competes 
        Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-358; 124 Stat.

        &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE II--ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULATORY BURDEN 
                          REDUCTION&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 201. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON RESEARCH 
              REGULATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Scientific and technological advancement have 
        been the largest drivers of economic growth in the last 50 
        years, with the Federal Government being the largest investor 
        in basic research.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Federally funded grants are increasingly 
        competitive, with the Foundation funding only approximately 1 
        in every 5 grant proposals.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Researchers spend as much as 42 percent of 
        their time complying with Federal regulations, including 
        administrative tasks such as applying for grants or meeting 
        reporting requirements.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The time spent on the activities described in 
        paragraph (3) affects efficiency and reduces valuable research 
        time.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
administrative burdens faced by researchers may be reducing the return 
on investment of federally funded research and development.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Establishment.--The Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, in coordination with the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, shall establish an interagency working group 
(referred to in this section as the ``Working Group'') to reduce 
administrative burdens on federally funded researchers while protecting 
the public interest in the transparency of and accountability for 
federally funded activities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Responsibilities.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Working Group shall--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) regularly review relevant, 
                administration-related regulations imposed on federally 
                funded researchers; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) recommend those regulations or 
                processes that may be eliminated, streamlined, or 
                otherwise improved for the purpose described in 
                subsection (c).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Grant review.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--The Working Group, in 
                consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, 
                shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) conduct a comprehensive review 
                        of Federal science agency grant proposal 
                        documents; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) develop, to the extent 
                        practicable, a simplified, uniform grant format 
                        to be used by all Federal science 
                        agencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Considerations.--In developing the 
                uniform grant format, the Working Group shall consider 
                whether to implement--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) procedures for preliminary 
                        project proposals in advance of peer-review 
                        selection;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) increased use of ``Just-In-
                        Time'' procedures for documentation that does 
                        not bear directly on the scientific merit of a 
                        proposal;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) simplified initial budget 
                        proposals in advance of peer review selection; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iv) detailed budget proposals for 
                        applicants that peer review selection 
                        identifies as likely to be funded.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Centralized researcher profile database.--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Establishment.--The Working Group 
                shall establish, to the extent practicable, a secure, 
                centralized database for investigator biosketches, 
                curriculum vitae, licenses, publications, and other 
                documents considered relevant by the Working 
                Group.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Considerations.--In establishing the 
                centralized database under subparagraph (A), the 
                Working Group shall consider incorporating existing 
                investigator databases.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) Grant proposals.--To the extent 
                practicable, all grant proposals shall utilize the 
                centralized researcher profile database established 
                under subparagraph (A).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Requirements.--Each investigator 
                shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) be responsible for ensuring 
                        the investigator's profile is current and 
                        accurate; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) be assigned a unique 
                        identifier linked to the database and 
                        accessible to all Federal funding 
                        agencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Centralized assurances repository.--The 
        Working Group shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        programs and activities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) ways to leverage private and 
                        nonprofit STEM investments and encourage 
                        public-private partnerships to strengthen STEM 
                        education and help build the STEM workforce 
                        pipeline; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) how Federal agencies 
                        incentivize colleges and universities to 
                        improve retention of STEM students.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 305. GRANT PROGRAMS TO EXPAND STEM 
              OPPORTUNITIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Economic projections by the Bureau of Labor 
        Statistics indicate that by 2018, there could be 2.4 million 
        unfilled STEM jobs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Women represent slightly more than half the 
        United States population, and projections indicate that 54 
        percent of the population will be a member of a racial or 
        ethnic minority group by 2050.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Despite representing half the population, 
        women comprise only about 30 percent of STEM workers according 
        to a 2015 report by the National Center for Science and 
        Engineering Statistics.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) A 2014 National Center for Education 
        Statistics study found that women and underrepresented 
        minorities leave the STEM fields at higher rates than their 
        counterparts.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The representation of women in STEM drops 
        significantly at the faculty level. Overall, women hold only 25 
        percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 17 
        percent of full professor positions in STEM fields in our 
        Nation's universities and 4-year colleges.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about 
        6.5 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 5 
        percent of full professor positions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Many of the numbers in the American Indian or 
        Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
        categories for different faculty ranks were too small for the 
        National Science Foundation to report publicly without 
        potentially compromising confidential information about the 
        individuals being surveyed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) it is critical to our Nation's economic 
        leadership and global competitiveness that we educate, train, 
        and retain more scientists and engineers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) there is currently a disconnect between the 
        availability of and growing demand for STEM-skilled 
        workers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) women, minorities, and persons with 
        disabilities are the largest untapped STEM talent pools in the 
        United States; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) given the shifting demographic landscape, the 
        United States should encourage full participation of 
        individuals described in paragraph (3) in STEM 
        fields.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Reaffirmation.--The Director of the Foundation shall 
continue to support existing programs designed to broaden participation 
of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in STEM 
fields.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Program To Broaden Participation in STEM Fields.--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Director of the Foundation 
        shall award grants on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, to 
        eligible entities to increase the participation of women and 
        groups underrepresented in STEM fields.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Applications.--An applicant seeking a grant 
        under this section shall submit an application to the Director 
        at such time, in such manner, and containing such information 
        as the Director may require.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Use of funds.--Activities supported by grants 
        under this section may include the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Online workshops.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Mentoring programs that partner

                professionals with applicable students.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) Internships for applicable 
                undergraduate and graduate students in STEM 
                fields.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Conducting outreach programs that 
                provide applicable elementary school and secondary 
                school students with opportunities to increase their 
                exposure to STEM fields.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) Programs to increase the recruitment 
                and retention of underrepresented faculty.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) Such additional programs as the 
                Director of the Foundation may consider 
                appropriate.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Grant Program for Grades K Through 8.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Director of the Foundation 
        shall award grants to be used for research to advance the 
        engagement of students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM 
        that are designed to encourage interest, engagement, and skills

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 402. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the authority granted to Federal agencies 
        under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public 
        Law 111-358; 124 Stat. 3982) to pursue the use of incentive 
        prizes and challenges has yielded numerous benefits;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) crowdsourcing and citizen science projects 
        have a number of additional unique benefits, including 
        accelerating scientific research, addressing societal needs, 
        providing hands-on learning in STEM, and connecting members of 
        the public directly to Federal agency missions and to each 
        other; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) granting Federal agencies the direct, explicit 
        authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will 
        encourage its appropriate use to advance agency missions and 
        stimulate and facilitate broader public participation in the 
        innovation process, yielding numerous benefits to the Federal 
        Government and citizens who participate in such 
        projects.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Definitions.--In this section:&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                experiments;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) collecting and analyzing 
                data;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                ownership, compensation, service, program, and other 
                terms of use to the participant in a clear and

   &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE VI--INNOVATION, COMMERCIALIZATION, AND TECHNOLOGY 
                           TRANSFER&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 601. INNOVATION CORPS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation 
        Corps (referred to in this section as the ``I-Corps'') was 
        established to foster a national innovation ecosystem by 
        encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, and 
        entrepreneurs to identify and explore the innovation and 
        commercial potential of National Science Foundation-funded 
        research well beyond the laboratory.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Through I-Corps, the Foundation invests in 
        entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and 
        mentoring that can ultimately lead to the practical deployment 
        of technologies, products, processes, and services that improve 
        the Nation's competitiveness, promote economic growth, and 
        benefit society.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) By building networks of entrepreneurs, 
        educators, mentors, institutions, and collaborations, and 
        supporting specialized education and training, I-Corps is at 
        the leading edge of a strong, lasting foundation for an 
        American innovation ecosystem.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) By translating federally funded research to a 
        commercial stage more quickly and efficiently, programs like 
        the I-Corps create new jobs and companies, help solve societal 
        problems, and provide taxpayers with a greater return on their 
        investment in research.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The I-Corps program model has a strong record 
        of success that should be replicated at all Federal science 
        agencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) commercialization of federally funded research 
        can improve the Nation's competitiveness, grow the economy, and 
        benefit society;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) I-Corps is a useful tool in promoting the 
        commercialization of federally funded research by training 
        researchers funded by the Foundation in entrepreneurship and 
        commercialization;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) I-Corps should continue to build a network of 
        entrepreneurs, educators, mentors, and institutions and support 
        specialized education and training; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) researchers other than those funded by the 
        Foundation may also benefit from the education and training 
        described in paragraph (3).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) I-Corps Program.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--In order to promote a strong, 
        lasting foundation for the national innovation ecosystem and 
        increase the positive economic and social impact of federally 
        funded research, the Director of the Foundation shall set forth 
        eligibility requirements and carry out a program to award 
        grants for entrepreneurship and commercialization education, 
        training, and mentoring.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Expansion of i-corps.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--The Director--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) shall encourage the 
                        development and expansion of I-Corps and other 
                        training programs that focus on professional 
                        development, including education in 
                        entrepreneurship and commercialization; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) may establish an agreement 
                        with another Federal science agency--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) to make researchers, 
                                students, and institutions funded by 
                                that agency eligible to participate in 
                                the I-Corps program; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (II) to assist that agency 
                                with the design and implementation of 
                                its own program that is similar to the 
                                I-Corps program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Partnership funding.--In negotiating 
                an agreement with another Federal science agency under 
                subparagraph (A)(ii), the Director shall require that 
                Federal science agency to provide funding for--
                &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the training for researchers, 
                        students, and institutions selected for the I-
                        Corps program; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) the locations that Federal 
                        science agency designates as regional and 
                        national infrastructure for science and 
                        engineering entrepreneurship.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Follow-on commercialization grants.--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph 
                (B), the Director, in consultation with the Director of 
                the Small Business Innovation Research Program, shall 
                make funds available for competitive grants, including 
                to I-Corps participants, to help support--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) prototype or proof-of-concept 
                        development; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) such activities as the 
                        Director considers necessary to build local, 
                        regional, and national infrastructure for 
                        science and engineering 
                        entrepreneurship.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Limitation.--Grants under subparagraph 
                (A) shall be limited to participants with innovations 
                that because of the early stage of development are not 
                eligible to participate in a Small Business Innovation 
                Research Program or a Small Business Technology

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) State and local partnerships.--The Director 
        may engage in partnerships with State and local governments, 
        economic development organizations, and nonprofit organizations

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 603. OPTICS AND PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY 
              INNOVATIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The 1998 National Research Council Report, 
        ``Harnessing Light'' presented a comprehensive overview on the 
        importance of optics and photonics to various sectors of the 
        United States economy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) In 2012, in response to increased coordination 
        and investment by other nations, the National Research Council 
        released a follow up study recommending a national photonics 
        initiative to increase collaboration and coordination among 
        United States industry, Federal and State government, and 
        academia to identify and further advance areas of photonics 
        critical to regaining United States competitiveness and 
        maintaining national security.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Publicly traded companies focused on optics 
        and photonics in the United States enable more than $3 trillion 
        in revenue annually.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) optics and photonics research and technologies 
        promote United States global competitiveness in industry 
        sectors, including telecommunications and information 
        technology, energy, healthcare and medicine, manufacturing, and 
        defense;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Federal science agencies, industry, and 
        academia should seek partnerships with each other to develop 
        basic research in optics and photonics into more mature 
        technologies and capabilities; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) each Federal science agency, as appropriate, 
        should--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) survey and identify optics and 
                photonics-related programs within that Federal science 
                agency and share results with other Federal science 
                agencies for the purpose of generating multiple 
                applications and uses;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) partner with the private sector and 
                academia to leverage knowledge and resources to 
                maximize opportunities for innovation in optics and 
                photonics;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) explore research and development 
                opportunities, including Federal and private sector-
                sponsored internships, to ensure a highly trained 
                optics and photonics workforce in the United States; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) encourage partnerships between 
                academia and industry to promote improvement in the 
                education of optics and photonics technicians at the 
                secondary school level, undergraduate level, and 2-year 
                college level, including through the Foundation's 
                Advanced Technological Education program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 103. EPSCOR REAFFIRMATION AND UPDATE.

    (a) Findings.--Section 517(a) of the America COMPETES 
Reauthorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 1862p-9(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``The National'' and inserting 
                ``the National''; and
                    (B) by striking ``education,'' and inserting 
                ``education'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``with 27 States'' and 
        all that follows through the semicolon at the end and inserting 
        ``with 28 States and jurisdictions, taken together, receiving 
        only about 12 percent of all National Science Foundation 
        research funding;'';
            (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:
            ``(3) each of the States described in paragraph (2) 
        receives only a fraction of 1 percent of the Foundation's 
        research dollars each year;''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) first established at the National Science Foundation 
        in 1979, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive 
        Research (referred to in this section as `EPSCoR') assists 
        States and jurisdictions historically underserved by Federal 
        research and development funding in strengthening their 
        research and innovation capabilities;
            ``(5) the EPSCoR structure requires each participating 
        State to develop a science and technology plan suited to State 
        and local research, education, and economic interests and 
        objectives;
            ``(6) EPSCoR has been credited with advancing the research 
        competitiveness of participating States, improving awareness of 
        science, promoting policies that link scientific investment and 
        economic growth, and encouraging partnerships between 
        government, industry, and academia;
            ``(7) EPSCoR proposals are evaluated through a rigorous and 
        competitive merit-review process to ensure that awarded 
        research and development efforts meet high scientific 
        standards; and
            ``(8) according to the National Academy of Sciences, EPSCoR 
        has strengthened the national research infrastructure and 
        enhanced the educational opportunities needed to develop the 
        science and engineering workforce.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) since maintaining the Nation's scientific and 
                economic leadership requires the participation of 
                talented individuals nationwide, EPSCoR investments 
                into State research and education capacities are in the 
                Federal interest and should be sustained; and
                    (B) EPSCoR should maintain its experimental 
                component by supporting innovative methods for 
                improving research capacity and competitiveness.
            (2) Definition of epscor.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``EPSCoR'' has the meaning given the term in section 502 of the 
        America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 1862p 
        note).

        TITLE II--ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULATORY BURDEN REDUCTION

SEC. 201. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON RESEARCH REGULATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Scientific and technological advancement have been the 
        largest drivers of economic growth in the last 50 years, with 
        the Federal Government being the largest investor in basic 
        research.
            (2) Federally funded grants are increasingly competitive, 
        with the Foundation funding only approximately 1 in every 5 
        grant proposals.
            (3) Researchers spend as much as 42 percent of their time 
        complying with Federal regulations, including administrative 
        tasks such as applying for grants or meeting reporting 
        requirements.
            (4) The time spent on the activities described in paragraph 
        (3) affects efficiency and reduces valuable research time.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
administrative burdens faced by researchers may be reducing the return 
on investment of federally funded research and development.
    (c) Establishment.--The Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, shall establish an interagency working group (referred to in 
this section as the ``Working Group'') to reduce administrative burdens 
on federally funded researchers while protecting the public interest in 
the transparency of and accountability for federally funded activities.
    (d) Responsibilities.--
            (1) In general.--The Working Group shall--
                    (A) regularly review relevant, administration-
                related regulations imposed on federally funded 
                researchers; and
                    (B) recommend those regulations or processes that 
                may be eliminated, streamlined, or otherwise improved 
                for the purpose described in subsection (c).
            (2) Grant review.--
                    (A) In general.--The Working Group, in consultation 
                with the Office of Management and Budget, shall--
                            (i) conduct a comprehensive review of 
                        Federal science agency grant proposal 
                        documents; and
                            (ii) develop, to the extent practicable, a 
                        simplified, uniform grant format to be used by 
                        all Federal science agencies.
                    (B) Considerations.--In developing the uniform 
                grant format, the Working Group shall consider whether 
                to implement--
                            (i) procedures for preliminary project 
                        proposals in advance of peer-review selection;
                            (ii) increased use of ``Just-In-Time'' 
                        procedures for documentation that does not bear 
                        directly on the scientific merit of a proposal;
                            (iii) simplified initial budget proposals 
                        in advance of peer review selection; and
                            (iv) detailed budget proposals for 
                        applicants that peer review selection 
                        identifies as likely to be funded.
            (3) Centralized researcher profile database.--
                    (A) Establishment.--The Working Group shall 
                establish, to the extent practicable, a secure,

SEC. 305. GRANT PROGRAMS TO EXPAND STEM OPPORTUNITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Economic projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
        indicate that by 2018, there could be 2.4 million unfilled STEM 
        jobs.
            (2) Women represent slightly more than half the United 
        States population, and projections indicate that 54 percent of 
        the population will be a member of a racial or ethnic minority 
        group by 2050.
            (3) Despite representing half the population, women 
        comprise only about 30 percent of STEM workers according to a 
        2015 report by the National Center for Science and Engineering 
        Statistics.
            (4) A 2014 National Center for Education Statistics study 
        found that women and underrepresented minorities leave the STEM 
        fields at higher rates than their counterparts.
            (5) The representation of women in STEM drops significantly 
        at the faculty level. Overall, women hold only 25 percent of 
        all tenured and tenure-track positions and 17 percent of full 
        professor positions in STEM fields in our Nation's universities 
        and 4-year colleges.
            (6) Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about 6.5 
        percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 5 percent 
        of full professor positions.
            (7) Many of the numbers in the American Indian or Alaskan 
        Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander categories 
        for different faculty ranks were too small for the National 
        Science Foundation to report publicly without potentially 
        compromising confidential information about the individuals 
        being surveyed.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is critical to our Nation's economic leadership and 
        global competitiveness that we educate, train, and retain more 
        scientists, engineers, and computer scientists;
            (2) there is currently a disconnect between the 
        availability of and growing demand for STEM-skilled workers;
            (3) women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are 
        the largest untapped STEM talent pools in the United States; 
        and
            (4) given the shifting demographic landscape, the United 
        States should encourage full participation of individuals 
        described in paragraph (3) in STEM fields.
    (c) Reaffirmation.--The Director of the Foundation shall continue 
to support existing programs designed to broaden participation of 
women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in STEM fields.
    (d) Program to Broaden Participation in STEM Fields.--
            (1) In general.--The Director of the Foundation shall award 
        grants on a competitive, merit-reviewed basis, to eligible 
        entities to increase the participation of women and groups 
        underrepresented in STEM fields.
            (2) Applications.--An applicant seeking a grant under this 
        section shall submit an application to the Director at such 
        time, in such manner, and containing such information as the 
        Director may require.
            (3) Use of funds.--Activities supported by grants under 
        this section may include the following:
                    (A) Online workshops.
                    (B) Mentoring programs that partner science, 
                technology, engineering, mathematics, or computer 
                science professionals with applicable students.
                    (C) Internships for applicable undergraduate and 
                graduate students in STEM fields.
                    (D) Conducting outreach programs that provide 
                applicable elementary school and secondary school 
                students with opportunities to increase their exposure 
                to STEM fields.
                    (E) Programs to increase the recruitment and 
                retention of underrepresented faculty.
                    (F) Such additional programs as the Director of the 
                Foundation may consider appropriate.
    (e) Grant Program for Grades K Through 8.--
            (1) In general.--The Director of the Foundation shall award 
        grants to be used for research to advance the engagement of 
        students in grades kindergarten through 8 in STEM that are 
        designed to encourage interest, engagement, and skills 
        development of students in STEM fields, particularly those who 
        are members of groups underrepresented in STEM fields.
            (2) Use of funds.--Activities supported by grants under 
        this section may include--
                    (A) development and implementation of programming 
                described in paragraph (1) for the purpose of research;
                    (B) use of a variety of engagement methods,

SEC. 313. DEVELOPING STEM APPRENTICESHIPS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The lack of data on the return on investment for United 
        States employers using registered apprenticeships makes it 
        difficult--
                    (A) to communicate the value of these programs to 
                businesses; and
                    (B) to expand registered apprenticeships.
            (2) The lack of data on the value and impact of employer-
        provided worker training, which is likely substantial, hinders 
        the ability of the Federal Government to formulate policy 
        related to workforce training.
            (3) The Secretary of Commerce has initiated--
                    (A) the first study on the return on investment for 
                United States employers using registered 
                apprenticeships through case studies of firms in 
                various sectors, occupations, and geographic locations 
                to provide the business community with data on employer 
                benefits and costs; and
                    (B) discussions with officials at relevant Federal 
                agencies about the need to collect comprehensive data 
                on--
                            (i) employer-provided worker training; and
                            (ii) existing tools that could be used to 
                        collect such data.
    (b) Development of Apprenticeship Information.--The Secretary of 
Commerce shall continue to research the value to businesses of 
utilizing apprenticeship programs, including--
            (1) evidence of return on investment of apprenticeships, 
        including estimates for the average time it takes a business to 
        recover the costs associated with training apprentices; and
            (2) data from the United States Census Bureau and other 
        statistical surveys on employer-provided training, including 
        apprenticeships and other on-the-job training and industry-
        recognized certification programs.
    (c) Dissemination of Apprenticeship Information.--The Secretary of 
Commerce shall disseminate findings from research on apprenticeships to 
businesses and other relevant stakeholders, including--
            (1) institutions of higher education;
            (2) State and local chambers of commerce; and
            (3) workforce training organizations.
    (d) Studying Approaches to Collecting Employer-provided Worker 
Training Data.--The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor 
shall--
            (1) collaborate to identify approaches to collecting 
        employer-provided worker training data;
            (2) provide a report to the relevant congressional 
        committees on--
                    (A) the existing tools available to collect such 
                data; and
                    (B) the time and cost of collecting such data; and
            (3) provide recommendations to the relevant congressional 
        committees on additional tools that may be needed to collect 
        such data.
    (e) New Apprenticeship Program Study.--The Secretary of Commerce 
and the Secretary of Labor shall collaborate to study approaches for 
reducing the cost of creating new apprenticeship programs and hosting 
apprentices for businesses, particularly small businesses, including--
            (1) training sharing agreements;
            (2) group training models; and
            (3) pooling resources and best practices.

        America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-
        358; 124 Stat. 3982) to pursue the use of incentive prizes and 
        challenges has yielded numerous benefits;
            (2) crowdsourcing and citizen science projects have a 
        number of additional unique benefits, including accelerating 
        scientific research, increasing cost effectiveness to maximize 
        the return on taxpayer dollars, addressing societal needs, 
        providing hands-on learning in STEM, and connecting members of 
        the public directly to Federal agency missions and to each 
        other; and
            (3) granting Federal agencies the direct, explicit 
        authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will 
        encourage its appropriate use to advance agency missions and 
        stimulate and facilitate broader public participation in the 
        innovation process, yielding numerous benefits to the Federal 
        Government and citizens who participate in such projects.

    TITLE VI--INNOVATION, COMMERCIALIZATION, AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

SEC. 601. INNOVATION CORPS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps 
        (referred to in this section as the ``I-Corps'') was 
        established to foster a national innovation ecosystem by 
        encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, and 
        entrepreneurs to identify and explore the innovation and 
        commercial potential of National Science Foundation-funded 
        research well beyond the laboratory.
            (2) Through I-Corps, the Foundation invests in 
        entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and 
        mentoring that can ultimately lead to the practical deployment 
        of technologies, products, processes, and services that improve 
        the Nation's competitiveness, promote economic growth, and 
        benefit society.
            (3) By building networks of entrepreneurs, educators, 
        mentors, institutions, and collaborations, and supporting 
        specialized education and training, I-Corps is at the leading 
        edge of a strong, lasting foundation for an American innovation 
        ecosystem.
            (4) By translating federally funded research to a 
        commercial stage more quickly and efficiently, programs like 
        the I-Corps create new jobs and companies, help solve societal 
        problems, and provide taxpayers with a greater return on their 
        investment in research.
            (5) The I-Corps program model has a strong record of 
        success that should be replicated at all Federal science 
        agencies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) commercialization of federally-funded research can 
        improve the Nation's competitiveness, grow the economy, and 
        benefit society;
            (2) I-Corps is a useful tool in promoting the 
        commercialization of federally-funded research by training 
        researchers funded by the Foundation in entrepreneurship and 
        commercialization;
            (3) I-Corps should continue to build a network of 
        entrepreneurs, educators, mentors, and institutions and support 
        specialized education and training; and
            (4) researchers other than those funded by the Foundation 
        may also benefit from the education and training described in 
        paragraph (3).
    (c) I-Corps Program.--
            (1) In general.--In order to promote a strong, lasting 
        foundation for the national innovation ecosystem and increase 
        the positive economic and social impact of federally-funded 
        research, the Director of the Foundation shall set forth 
        eligibility requirements and carry out a program to award 
        grants for entrepreneurship and commercialization education, 
        training, and mentoring.
            (2) Expansion of i-corps.--
                    (A) In general.--The Director--
                            (i) shall encourage the development and 
                        expansion of I-Corps and other training 
                        programs that focus on professional 
                        development, including education in 
                        entrepreneurship and commercialization; and
                            (ii) may establish an agreement with 
                        another Federal science agency--
                                    (I) to make researchers, students, 
                                and institutions funded by that agency 
                                eligible to participate in the I-Corps 
                                program; or
                                    (II) to assist that agency with the 
                                design and implementation of its own 
                                program that is similar to the I-Corps

SEC. 603. OPTICS AND PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 1998 National Research Council Report, ``Harnessing 
        Light'' presented a comprehensive overview on the importance of 
        optics and photonics to various sectors of the United States 
        economy.
            (2) In 2012, in response to increased coordination and 
        investment by other nations, the National Research Council 
        released a follow up study recommending a national photonics 
        initiative to increase collaboration and coordination among 
        United States industry, Federal and State government, and 
        academia to identify and further advance areas of photonics 
        critical to regaining United States competitiveness and 
        maintaining national security.
            (3) Publicly-traded companies focused on optics and 
        photonics in the United States enable more than $3 trillion in 
        revenue annually.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) optics and photonics research and technologies promote 
        United States global competitiveness in industry sectors, 
        including telecommunications and information technology, 
        energy, healthcare and medicine, manufacturing, and defense;
            (2) Federal science agencies, industry, and academia should 
        seek partnerships with each other to develop basic research in 
        optics and photonics into more mature technologies and 
        capabilities; and
            (3) each Federal science agency, as appropriate, should--
                    (A) survey and identify optics and photonics-
                related programs within that Federal science agency and 
                share results with other Federal science agencies for
