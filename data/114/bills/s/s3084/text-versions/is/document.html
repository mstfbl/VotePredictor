                ``the National''; and
                    (B) by striking ``education,'' and inserting 
                ``education'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``with 27 States'' and 
        all that follows through the semicolon at the end and inserting 
        ``with 28 States and jurisdictions, taken together, receiving

        States and jurisdictions historically underserved by Federal 
        research and development funding in strengthening their 
        research and innovation capabilities;
            ``(5) the EPSCoR structure requires each participating 
        State to develop a science and technology plan suited to State 
        and local research, education, and economic interests and 
        objectives;
            ``(6) EPSCoR has been credited with advancing the research 
        competitiveness of participating States, improving awareness of 
        science, promoting policies that link scientific investment and 
        economic growth, and encouraging partnerships between 
        government, industry, and academia;
            ``(7) EPSCoR proposals are evaluated through a rigorous and 
        competitive merit review process to ensure that awarded 
        research and development efforts meet high scientific 
        standards; and
            ``(8) according to the National Academy of Sciences, EPSCoR 
        has strengthened the national research infrastructure and 
        enhanced the educational opportunities needed to develop the 
        science and engineering workforce.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) since maintaining the Nation's scientific and 
                economic leadership requires the participation of 
                talented individuals nationwide, EPSCoR investments 
                into State research and education capacities are in the 
                Federal interest and should be sustained; and
                    (B) EPSCoR should maintain its experimental 
                component by supporting innovative methods for 
                improving research capacity and competitiveness.
            (2) Definition of epscor.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``EPSCoR'' has the meaning given the term in section 502 of the

                of larger, renewable funding opportunities; and
                    ``(B) to allow the agency, States, and 
                jurisdictions to experiment with new research and 
                development funding models; and
            ``(3) consider modifications to the mechanisms used to

        TITLE II--ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULATORY BURDEN REDUCTION

SEC. 201. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP ON RESEARCH REGULATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Scientific and technological advancement have been the 
        largest drivers of economic growth in the last 50 years, with 
        the Federal Government being the largest investor in basic 
        research.
            (2) Federally funded grants are increasingly competitive, 
        with the Foundation funding only approximately 1 in every 5 
        grant proposals.
            (3) Researchers spend as much as 42 percent of their time 
        complying with Federal regulations, including administrative 
        tasks such as applying for grants or meeting reporting 
        requirements.
            (4) The time spent on the activities described in paragraph 
        (3) affects efficiency and reduces valuable research time.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
administrative burdens faced by researchers may be reducing the return 
on investment of federally funded research and development.
    (c) Establishment.--The Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, shall establish an interagency working group (referred to in 
this section as the ``Working Group'') to reduce administrative burdens 
on federally funded researchers while protecting the public interest in 
the transparency of and accountability for federally funded activities.
    (d) Responsibilities.--
            (1) In general.--The Working Group shall--
                    (A) regularly review relevant, administration-
                related regulations imposed on federally funded 
                researchers; and
                    (B) recommend those regulations or processes that 
                may be eliminated, streamlined, or otherwise improved 
                for the purpose described in subsection (c).
            (2) Grant review.--
                    (A) In general.--The Working Group, in consultation 
                with the Office of Management and Budget, shall--

                        Federal science agency grant proposal 
                        documents; and
                            (ii) develop, to the extent practicable, a 
                        simplified, uniform grant format to be used by 
                        all Federal science agencies.
                    (B) Considerations.--In developing the uniform 
                grant format, the Working Group shall consider whether 
                to implement--
                            (i) procedures for preliminary project 
                        proposals in advance of peer-review selection;
                            (ii) increased use of ``Just-In-Time'' 
                        procedures for documentation that does not bear 
                        directly on the scientific merit of a proposal;
                            (iii) simplified initial budget proposals 
                        in advance of peer review selection; and
                            (iv) detailed budget proposals for 
                        applicants that peer review selection 
                        identifies as likely to be funded.

        jobs.
            (2) Women represent slightly more than half the United 
        States population, and projections indicate that 54 percent of 
        the population will be a member of a racial or ethnic minority 
        group by 2050.
            (3) Despite representing half the population, women 
        comprise only about 30 percent of STEM workers according to a 
        2015 report by the National Center for Science and Engineering 
        Statistics.
            (4) A 2014 National Center for Education Statistics study 
        found that women and underrepresented minorities leave the STEM 
        fields at higher rates than their counterparts.
            (5) The representation of women in STEM drops significantly 
        at the faculty level. Overall, women hold only 25 percent of 
        all tenured and tenure-track positions and 17 percent of full 
        professor positions in STEM fields in our Nation's universities 
        and 4-year colleges.
            (6) Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about 6.5 
        percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 5 percent 
        of full professor positions.
            (7) Many of the numbers in the American Indian or Alaskan 
        Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander categories 
        for different faculty ranks were too small for the National 
        Science Foundation to report publicly without potentially 
        compromising confidential information about the individuals 
        being surveyed.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is critical to our Nation's economic leadership and 
        global competitiveness that we educate, train, and retain more 
        scientists and engineers;
            (2) there is currently a disconnect between the 
        availability of and growing demand for STEM-skilled workers;
            (3) women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are 
        the largest untapped STEM talent pools in the United States; 
        and
            (4) given the shifting demographic landscape, the United 
        States should encourage full participation of individuals 
        described in paragraph (3) in STEM fields.
    (c) Reaffirmation.--The Director of the Foundation shall continue 
to support existing programs designed to broaden participation of 
women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in STEM fields.

    TITLE VI--INNOVATION, COMMERCIALIZATION, AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

SEC. 601. INNOVATION CORPS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps 
        (referred to in this section as the ``I-Corps'') was 
        established to foster a national innovation ecosystem by 
        encouraging institutions, scientists, engineers, and 
        entrepreneurs to identify and explore the innovation and 
        commercial potential of National Science Foundation-funded 
        research well beyond the laboratory.
            (2) Through I-Corps, the Foundation invests in 
        entrepreneurship and commercialization education, training, and 
        mentoring that can ultimately lead to the practical deployment 
        of technologies, products, processes, and services that improve 
        the Nation's competitiveness, promote economic growth, and 
        benefit society.
            (3) By building networks of entrepreneurs, educators, 
        mentors, institutions, and collaborations, and supporting 
        specialized education and training, I-Corps is at the leading 
        edge of a strong, lasting foundation for an American innovation 
        ecosystem.
            (4) By translating federally funded research to a 
        commercial stage more quickly and efficiently, programs like 
        the I-Corps create new jobs and companies, help solve societal 
        problems, and provide taxpayers with a greater return on their 
        investment in research.
            (5) The I-Corps program model has a strong record of 
        success that should be replicated at all Federal science 
        agencies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) commercialization of federally funded research can 
        improve the Nation's competitiveness, grow the economy, and 
        benefit society;
            (2) I-Corps is a useful tool in promoting the 
        commercialization of federally funded research by training 
        researchers funded by the Foundation in entrepreneurship and 
        commercialization;
            (3) I-Corps should continue to build a network of 
        entrepreneurs, educators, mentors, and institutions and support 
        specialized education and training; and
            (4) researchers other than those funded by the Foundation 
        may also benefit from the education and training described in 
        paragraph (3).
    (c) I-Corps Program.--
            (1) In general.--In order to promote a strong, lasting 
        foundation for the national innovation ecosystem and increase 
        the positive economic and social impact of federally funded 
        research, the Director of the Foundation shall set forth 
        eligibility requirements and carry out a program to award 
        grants for entrepreneurship and commercialization education,

                        programs that focus on professional 
                        development, including education in 
                        entrepreneurship and commercialization; and
                            (ii) may establish an agreement with 
                        another Federal science agency--

SEC. 603. OPTICS AND PHOTONICS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The 1998 National Research Council Report, ``Harnessing 
        Light'' presented a comprehensive overview on the importance of 
        optics and photonics to various sectors of the United States 
        economy.
            (2) In 2012, in response to increased coordination and 
        investment by other nations, the National Research Council 
        released a follow up study recommending a national photonics 
        initiative to increase collaboration and coordination among 
        United States industry, Federal and State government, and 
        academia to identify and further advance areas of photonics 
        critical to regaining United States competitiveness and 
        maintaining national security.
            (3) Publicly traded companies focused on optics and 
        photonics in the United States enable more than $3 trillion in 
        revenue annually.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) optics and photonics research and technologies promote 
        United States global competitiveness in industry sectors, 
        including telecommunications and information technology, 
        energy, healthcare and medicine, manufacturing, and defense;
            (2) Federal science agencies, industry, and academia should 
        seek partnerships with each other to develop basic research in 
        optics and photonics into more mature technologies and 
        capabilities; and
            (3) each Federal science agency, as appropriate, should--
                    (A) survey and identify optics and photonics-
                related programs within that Federal science agency and 
                share results with other Federal science agencies for 
                the purpose of generating multiple applications and 
                uses;
                    (B) partner with the private sector and academia to 
                leverage knowledge and resources to maximize 
                opportunities for innovation in optics and photonics;
                    (C) explore research and development opportunities,
