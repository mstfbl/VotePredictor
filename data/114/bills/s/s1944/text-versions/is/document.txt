                    (A) issue a covered rule that does not amend or 
                modify an existing rule of the agency, unless--
                            (i) the agency has repealed 1 or more

                        determined and certified by the head of the 
                        agency; or
                    (B) issue a covered rule that amends or modifies an 
                existing rule of the agency, unless--
                            (i) the agency has repealed or amended 1 or 
                        more existing covered rules of the agency; and
                            (ii) the cost of the covered rule to be 
                        issued is less than or equal to the cost of the 
                        covered rules repealed or amended under clause 
                        (i), as determined and certified by the head of 
                        the agency.
            (2) Penalty for failure to repeal or amend rules.--During 
        the period beginning on the date of failure to comply by an 
        agency with paragraph (1) in issuing a covered rule, and ending 
        on the date on which the agency complies with paragraph (1) 
        with respect to that covered rule, no statutory pay adjustment 
        (as defined in section 147(b) of the Continuing Appropriations 
        Act, 2011 (5 U.S.C. 5303 note)) shall take effect with respect 
        to any employee of the agency.
            (3) Application.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the 
        issuance of a covered rule by an agency that--
                    (A) relates to the internal policy or practice of 
                the agency or procurement by the agency; or
                    (B) is being revised to be less burdensome to 
                decrease requirements imposed by the covered rule or 
                the cost of compliance with the covered rule.
    (c) Considerations for Repealing Rules.--In determining whether to 
repeal a covered rule under subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(i) of subsection 
(b)(1), the head of the agency that issued the covered rule shall 
consider--
            (1) whether the covered rule achieved, or has been 
        ineffective in achieving, the original purpose of the covered 
        rule;
            (2) any adverse effects that could materialize if the 
        covered rule is repealed, in particular if those adverse 
        effects are the reason the covered rule was originally issued;
            (3) whether the costs of the covered rule outweigh any 
        benefits of the covered rule to the United States;
            (4) whether the covered rule has become obsolete due to 
        changes in technology, economic conditions, market practices, 
        or any other factors; and
            (5) whether the covered rule overlaps with a covered rule 
        to be issued by the agency.
    (d) Publication of Covered Rules in Unified Agenda.--
            (1) Requirements.--Each agency shall, on a semiannual 
        basis, submit jointly and without delay to the Office of 
        Information and Regulatory Affairs for publication in the 
        Unified Agenda a list containing--
                    (A) each covered rule that the agency intends to 
                issue during the 6-month period following the date of 
                submission;
                    (B) each covered rule that the agency intends to 
                repeal or amend in accordance with subsection (b) 
                during the 6-month period following the date of 
                submission; and
                    (C) the cost of each covered rule described in 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B).
            (2) Prohibition.--An agency may not issue a covered rule 
        unless the agency complies with the requirements under 
        paragraph (1).
