    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-
        211; 25 U.S.C. 2801 note) was enacted to enhance law 
        enforcement services, encourage interagency cooperation, and 
        improve Federal accountability for public safety in Indian 
        communities;
            (2) in 2013, the Bureau of Indian Affairs reported 
        increases in property crimes and violent crimes in Indian 
        country;
            (3) according to the Department of Justice, 34 percent of 
        total Indian country criminal matters are eligible for 
        prosecution, a percentage that has not decreased significantly 
        and has remained fairly steady;
            (4) during the period beginning in 2010 and ending on the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the number of law enforcement 
        officers working on public safety in Indian country has 
        slightly increased, but according to the Bureau of Indian 
        Affairs, only approximately 43 percent of the total need for 
        those officers is currently being met;
            (5) for a period of more than 40 years prior to the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Shadow Wolves, a special unit of 
        tactical officers of the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement, have been deployed throughout the Tohono O'odham 
        Nation reservation in Arizona and have been operating in an 
        area--
                    (A) of more than 5,000 square miles of vast, 
                desert, tribal land in the Southwest, 75 square miles 
                of which is an area located along the United States 
                border with Mexico;
                    (B) in which approximately 28,000 Indians reside; 
                and
                    (C) that has been targeted by criminal 
                organizations for use as a major corridor to deliver 
                contraband from Mexico to locations throughout the 
                United States, including other Indian reservations;
            (6) many Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal detention 
        facilities continue to operate in overcrowded conditions;
            (7) tribal justice systems have encountered barriers to 
        accessing criminal data and improvements to the ability to 
        access that data are needed to facilitate information sharing 
        by Federal agencies;
            (8) American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles are 
        overrepresented in Federal and State juvenile justice systems;
            (9) there is a lack of training, collaboration, 
        communication, and cooperation among government agencies 
        regarding juvenile justice for Indian youth;
            (10) tribal youth in the Federal justice system--
                    (A) may spend more time in secure confinement than 
                youth in State justice systems, sometimes by several 
                years; and
                    (B) are placed in facilities that may be located 
                far away from the communities and families of the 
                tribal youth; and
            (11) appropriate services for tribal youth in the Federal 
        justice system are unavailable.
