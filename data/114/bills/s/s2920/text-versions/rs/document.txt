        Law 111-211; 25 U.S.C. 2801 note) was enacted to enhance law 
        enforcement services, encourage interagency cooperation, and 
        improve Federal accountability for public safety in Indian 
        communities;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) in 2013, the Bureau of Indian Affairs reported 
        increases in property crimes and violent crimes in Indian 
        country;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) according to the Department of Justice, 34 
        percent of total Indian country criminal matters are eligible 
        for prosecution, a percentage that has not decreased 
        significantly and has remained fairly steady;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) during the period beginning in 2010 and ending 
        on the date of enactment of this Act, the number of law 
        enforcement officers working on public safety in Indian country 
        has slightly increased, but according to the Bureau of Indian 
        Affairs, only approximately 43 percent of the total need for 
        those officers is currently being met;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) for a period of more than 40 years prior to 
        the date of enactment of this Act, the Shadow Wolves, a special 
        unit of tactical officers of the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement, have been deployed throughout the Tohono O'odham

                reside; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) that has been targeted by criminal 
                organizations for use as a major corridor to deliver 
                contraband from Mexico to locations throughout the 
                United States, including other Indian 
                reservations;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) many Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal 
        detention facilities continue to operate in overcrowded 
        conditions;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) tribal justice systems have encountered 
        barriers to accessing criminal data and improvements to the 
        ability to access that data are needed to facilitate 
        information sharing by Federal agencies;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles 
        are overrepresented in Federal and State juvenile justice 
        systems;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) there is a lack of training, collaboration, 
        communication, and cooperation among government agencies 
        regarding juvenile justice for Indian youth;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) tribal youth in the Federal justice system--
        </DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) may spend more time in secure 
                confinement than youth in State justice systems, 
                sometimes by several years; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) are placed in facilities that may be 
                located far away from the communities and families of 
                the tribal youth; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) appropriate services for tribal youth in the

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (25 U.S.C. 2801 
        note; Public Law 111-211) was enacted to enhance law 
        enforcement services, encourage interagency cooperation, and 
        improve Federal accountability for public safety in Indian 
        communities;
            (2) in 2013, the Bureau of Indian Affairs reported 
        increases in property crimes and violent crimes in Indian 
        country;
            (3) according to the Department of Justice, in 2014, 34 
        percent of the total Indian country criminal matters submitted 
        for prosecution were declined, a percentage that has not 
        decreased significantly since the date of enactment of the 
        Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (25 U.S.C. 2801 note; Public 
        Law 111-211) and has remained fairly steady;
            (4) drug and alcohol abuse is a key contributing factor to 
        violence and crime in Indian communities;
            (5) substance abuse prevention and treatment, including 
        detention-based treatment, are critical to reducing the rates 
        of recidivism in Indian communities;
            (6) during the period beginning in 2010 and ending on the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the number of law enforcement 
        officers working on public safety in Indian country has 
        slightly increased, but according to the Bureau of Indian 
        Affairs, only approximately 43 percent of the total need for 
        those officers is currently being met;
            (7) for a period of more than 40 years prior to the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Shadow Wolves, a special unit of 
        tactical officers of the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement, have been deployed throughout the Tohono O'odham 
        Nation reservation in Arizona and have been operating in an 
        area--
                    (A) of more than 5,000 square miles of vast, 
                desert, tribal land in the Southwest, 75 square miles 
                of which is an area located along the United States 
                border with Mexico;
                    (B) in which approximately 28,000 Indians reside; 
                and
                    (C) that has been targeted by criminal 
                organizations for use as a major corridor to deliver 
                contraband from Mexico to locations throughout the 
                United States, including other Indian reservations;
            (8) many Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal detention 
        facilities continue to operate in overcrowded conditions;
            (9) tribes continue to encounter barriers to accessing and 
        entering information into national crime information databases 
        for criminal and civil purposes and additional options are 
        needed to ensure Indian tribes can fully participate in the 2-
        way sharing of criminal justice information so that all tribal 
        justice and public safety agencies have access to the data 
        needed to keep their communities safe;
            (10) American Indian and Alaska Native juveniles are 
        overrepresented in Federal and State juvenile justice systems;
            (11) there is a lack of training (including trauma-informed 
        training and practices), collaboration, communication, and 
        cooperation among government agencies regarding juvenile 
        justice for Indian youth;
            (12) tribal youth in the Federal justice system--
                    (A) may spend more time in secure confinement than 
                youth in State justice systems, sometimes by several 
                years; and
                    (B) may be placed in facilities located far away 
                from the communities and families of the tribal youth; 
                and
            (13) appropriate services for tribal youth in the Federal 
        and tribal justice systems are unavailable.
