SEC. 121. WAIVER OF FEES FOR RENEWAL OF IMMIGRANT VISA FOR ADOPTED 
              CHILD IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

    Section 221(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1201(c)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(c) Period of Validity; Renewal or Replacement.--
            ``(1) Immigrant visas.--An immigrant visa shall be valid 
        for such period, not exceeding 6 months, as shall be by 
        regulations prescribed, except that any visa issued to a child 
        lawfully adopted by a United States citizen and spouse while 
        such citizen is serving abroad in the United States Armed 
        Forces, or is employed abroad by the United States Government, 
        or is temporarily abroad on business, shall be valid until such 
        time, for a period not to exceed 3 years, as the adoptive 
        citizen parent returns to the United States in due course of 
        his service, employment, or business.
            ``(2) Nonimmigrant visas.--A nonimmigrant visa shall be 
        valid for such periods as shall be prescribed by regulations. 
        In prescribing the period of validity of a nonimmigrant visa in 
        the case of nationals of any foreign country who are eligible 
        for such visas, the Secretary of State shall, insofar as 
        practicable, accord to such nationals the same treatment upon a 
        reciprocal basis as such foreign country accords to nationals 
        of the United States who are within a similar class, except 
        that in the case of aliens who are nationals of a foreign 
        country and who either are granted refugee status and firmly 
        resettled in another foreign country or are granted permanent 
        residence and residing in another foreign country, the 
        Secretary of State may prescribe the period of validity of such 
        a visa based upon the treatment granted by that other foreign 
        country to alien refugees and permanent residents, 
        respectively, in the United States.
            ``(3) Visa replacement.--An immigrant visa may be replaced 
        under the original number during the fiscal year in which the 
        original visa was issued for an immigrant who establishes to 
        the satisfaction of the consular officer that the immigrant--
                    ``(A) was unable to use the original immigrant visa 
                during the period of its validity because of reasons 
                beyond his control and for which he was not 
                responsible;
                    ``(B) is found by a consular officer to be eligible 
                for an immigrant visa; and
                    ``(C) pays again the statutory fees for an 
                application and an immigrant visa.
            ``(4) Fee waiver.--If an immigrant visa was issued, on or 
        after March 27, 2013, for a child who has been lawfully 
        adopted, or who is coming to the United States to be adopted, 
        by a United States citizen, any statutory immigrant visa fees 
        relating to a renewal or replacement of such visa may be waived 
        or, if already paid, may be refunded upon request, subject to 
        such criteria as the Secretary of State may prescribe, if--
                    ``(A) the immigrant child was unable to use the 
                original immigrant visa during the period of its 
                validity as a direct result of extraordinary 
                circumstances, including the denial of an exit permit; 
                and
                    ``(B) if such inability was attributable to factors 
                beyond the control of the adopting parent or parents 
                and of the immigrant.''.

SEC. 122. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC INCITEMENT 
              WITHIN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the 1995 Interim Agreement on 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly referred to as Oslo II, 
specifically details that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall 
``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda, against each 
other and, without derogating from the principle of freedom of 
expression, shall take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any 
organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and 
        organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israeli 
        Jews and Palestinians, including--
                    (A) Professor Mohammed Dajani Daoudi, who took 
                students from al-Quds University in Jerusalem to visit 
                Auschwitz in March 2014 only to return to death threats 
                by fellow Palestinians and expulsion from his teacher's 
                union;
                    (B) the Israel Palestine Center for Research and 
                Information, the only joint Israeli-Palestinian public 
                policy think-tank,
                    (C) United Hatzalah, a nonprofit, fully volunteer 
                Emergency Medical Services organization that, 
                mobilizing volunteers who are religious or secular 
                Jews, Arabs, Muslims, and Christians, provides EMS 
                services to all people in Israel regardless of race, 
                religion, or national origin; and
                    (D) Breaking the Impasse, an apolitical initiative 
                of Palestinian and Israeli business and civil society 
                leaders who advocate for a two-state solution and an 
                urgent diplomatic solution to the conflict;
            (2) reiterates strong condemnation of anti-Israel and anti-
        Semitic incitement in the Palestinian Authority as antithetical 
        to the stated desire to achieve a just, lasting, and 
        comprehensive peace settlement; and
            (3) urges President Abbas and Palestinian Authority 
        officials to discontinue all official incitement that runs 
        contrary to the determination to put an end to decades of 
        confrontation.

SEC. 123. SUPPORT FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE, TERRITORIAL 
              INTEGRITY, AND INVIOLABILITY OF POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES IN

    It is the sense of Congress that Congress--
            (1) supports the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
        integrity, and inviolability of post-Soviet countries within 
        their internationally recognized borders;
            (2) expresses deep concern over increasingly aggressive 
        actions by the Russian Federation;
            (3) is committed to providing sufficient funding for the 
        Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs of the Department of 
        State to address subversive and destabilizing activities by the 
        Russian Federation within post-Soviet countries;
            (4) supports robust engagement between the United States 
        and post-Soviet countries through--
                    (A) the promotion of strengthened people-to-people 
                ties, including through educational and cultural 
                exchange programs;
                    (B) anticorruption assistance;
                    (C) public diplomacy;
                    (D) economic diplomacy; and
                    (E) other democratic reform efforts;
            (5) encourages the President to further enhance nondefense 
        cooperation and diplomatic engagement with post-Soviet 
        countries;
            (6) condemns the subversive and destabilizing activities 
        undertaken by the Russian Federation within post-Soviet 
        countries;
            (7) encourages enhanced cooperation between the United 
        States and the European Union to promote greater Euro-Atlantic 
        integration, including through--
                    (A) the enlargement of the European Union; and
                    (B) the Open Door policy of the North Atlantic 
                Treaty Organization;
            (8) urges continued cooperation between the United States 
        and the European Union to maintain sanctions against the 
        Russian Federation until the Government of Russia has--
                    (A) fully implemented all provisions of the Minsk 
                agreements, done at Minsk September 5, 2014 and 
                February 12, 2015; and
                    (B) demonstrated respect for the territorial 
                sovereignty of Ukraine;
            (9) calls on the member states of the European Union to 
        extend the current sanctions regime against the Russian 
        Federation; and
            (10) urges the consideration of additional sanctions if the 
        Russian Federation continue to engage in subversive and 
        destabilizing activities within post-Soviet countries.

        Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.''.
            (7) On November 29, 1987, DPRK agents planted explosive 
        devices onboard Korean Air flight 858, which killed all 115 
        passengers and crew on board.
            (8) On March 26, 2010, the DPRK fired upon and sank the 
        South Korean warship Cheonan, killing 46 of her crew.
            (9) On November 23, 2010, the DPRK shelled South Korea's 
        Yeonpyeong Island, killing 4 South Korean citizens.
            (10) On February 7, 2014, the United Nations Commission of 
        Inquiry on human rights in DPRK (in this subsection referred to 
        as the ``Commission of Inquiry'') released a report detailing 
        the atrocious human rights record of the DPRK.
            (11) Dr. Michael Kirby, Chair of the Commission of Inquiry, 
        stated on March 17, 2014, ``The Commission of Inquiry has found 
        systematic, widespread, and grave human rights violations 
        occurring in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It has 
        also found a disturbing array of crimes against humanity. These 
        crimes are committed against inmates of political and other 
        prison camps; against starving populations; against religious 
        believers; against persons who try to flee the country--
        including those forcibly repatriated by China.''.
            (12) Dr. Michael Kirby also stated, ``These crimes arise 
        from policies established at the highest level of the State. 
        They have been committed, and continue to take place in the 
        Democratic People's Republic of Korea, because the policies, 
        institutions, and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart 
        remain in place. The gravity, scale, duration, and nature of 
        the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a 
        totalitarian State that does not have any parallel in the 
        contemporary world.''.
            (13) The Commission of Inquiry also notes, ``Since 1950, 
        the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has engaged in the 
        systematic abduction, denial of repatriation, and subsequent 
        enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a 
        large scale and as a matter of State policy. Well over 200,000 
        persons, including children, who were brought from other 
        countries to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea may have 
        become victims of enforced disappearance,'' and states that the 
        DPRK has failed to account or address this injustice in any 
        way.
            (14) According to reports and analysis from organizations 
        such as the International Network for the Human Rights of North 
        Korean Overseas Labor, the Korea Policy Research Center, NK 
        Watch, the Asian Institute for Policy Studies, the Center for 
        International and Strategic Studies, and the George W. Bush 
        Institute, there may currently be as many as 100,000 North 
        Korean overseas laborers in various nations around the world.
            (15) Such forced North Korean laborers are often subjected 
        to harsh working conditions under the direct supervision of 
        DPRK officials, and their salaries contribute to anywhere from 
        $150,000,000 to $230,000,000 a year to the DPRK state coffers.
            (16) According to the Director of National Intelligence's 
        2015 Worldwide Threat Assessment, ``North Korea's nuclear 
        weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the 
        United States and to the security environment in East Asia.''.
            (17) The Worldwide Threat Assessment states, ``North Korea 
        has also expanded the size and sophistication of its ballistic 
        missile forces, ranging from close-range ballistic missiles to 
        ICBMs, while continuing to conduct test launches. In 2014, 
        North Korea launched an unprecedented number of ballistic 
        missiles.''.
            (18) On December 19, 2015, the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation declared that the DPRK was responsible for a 
        cyberattack on Sony Pictures conducted on November 24, 2014.
            (19) From 1988 to 2008, the DPRK was designated by the 
        United States Government as a state sponsor of terrorism.
            (20) The DPRK is currently in violation of United Nations 
        Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006), 1718 (2006), 1874 
        (2009), 2087 (2013), and 2094 (2013).
            (21) The DPRK repeatedly violated agreements with the 
        United States and the other so-called Six-Party Talks partners 
        (the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the 
        People's Republic of China) designed to halt its nuclear 
        weapons program, while receiving significant concessions, 
        including fuel, oil, and food aid.
            (22) The Six-Party Talks have not been held since December 
        2008.
            (23) On May 9, 2015, the DPRK claimed that it has test-
        fired a ballistic missile from a submarine.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the DPRK represents a serious threat to the national 
        security of the United States and United States allies in East 
        Asia and to international peace and stability, and grossly 
        violates the human rights of its own people;
            (2) the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the 
        Treasury should impose additional sanctions against the DPRK, 
        including targeting its financial assets around the world, 
        specific designations relating to human rights abuses, and a 
        redesignation of the DPRK as a state sponsor of terror; and
            (3) the President should not resume the negotiations with 
        the DPRK, either bilaterally or as part of the Six-Party Talks, 
        without strict preconditions, including that the DPRK--
                    (A) adhere to its denuclearization commitments 
                outlined in the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party 
                Talks;
                    (B) commit to halting its ballistic missile 
                programs and its proliferation activities;
                    (C) cease military provocations; and
                    (D) measurably and significantly improve its human 
                rights record.
