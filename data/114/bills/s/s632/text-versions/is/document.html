                      TITLE I--STRONG PATENTS ACT

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the patent property rights enshrined in the 
        Constitution of the United States provide the foundation for 
        the exceptional innovation environment in the United States;
            (2) strong patent rights encourage United States inventors 
        to invest their resources in creating new inventions;
            (3) patent protection has led to patient cures, positive 
        changes to the standard of living for all people in the United 
        States, and improvements to the agricultural, 
        telecommunications, and electronics industries, among others;
            (4) the United States patent system is an essential part of 
        the country's economic success;
            (5) strong patent protection improves the chances of 
        success for small companies and increases their chances of 
        securing financing from investors;
            (6) intellectual property-intensive industries in the 
        United States generate tens of millions of jobs for individuals 
        in the United States;
            (7) intellectual property-intensive industries in the 
        United States account for more than one-third of the country's 
        gross domestic product;
            (8) in the highly competitive global economy, the United 
        States needs to uphold strong patent protections to maintain 
        its position as the world's premier innovative country;
            (9) Congress last enacted comprehensive reforms of the 
        patent system only a few years ago, in 2011;
            (10) unintended consequences of the comprehensive 2011 
        reform of patent laws are continuing to become evident, 
        including the strategic filing of post-grant review proceedings 
        to depress stock prices and extort settlements;
            (11) the Judicial Conference of the United States is in the 
        process of making significant revisions to rules governing 
        pleadings and discovery in the Federal Rules of Civil 
        Procedure, with changes scheduled to take effect in December 
        2015;
            (12) the Supreme Court recently issued rulings in Octane 
        Fitness, LLC v. Icon Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1749 
        (2014) and Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, 
        Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1744 (2014) that significantly reduced the 
        burden on an alleged infringer to recover attorney fees from 
        the patent owner, and increased the incidence of fees shifted 
        to the losing party; and
            (13) efforts by Congress to reform the patent system 
        without careful scrutiny create a serious risk of making it 
        more costly and difficult for legitimate innovators to protect 
        their patents from infringement, thereby weakening United 
        States companies and the United States economy.

                license or enforce the patent at the time the 
                communications are sent, and the sender is not a person

                infringement occurred; or

                previously filed a civil action asserting a claim of

                is the subject of the written communication when the 
                sender knew such activity was held, in a final 
                determination, not to infringe the patent;
            (2) the sender of the communications, in bad faith, seeks 
        compensation for--
                    (A) a patent claim that has been held to be

                otherwise unenforceable against the recipient, in a

                    (B) activities undertaken by the recipient after 
                expiration of the patent asserted in the

                was authorized, with respect to the patent claim or 
                claims that are the subject of the communications, by a 
                person with the right to license the patent; or

                license the patent to, or enforce the patent against,

                alleged to infringe the identified patent;
                    (D) a description, to the extent reasonable under 
                the circumstances, of how the product, service, or

                patent and patent claim; or
                    (E) a name and contact information for a person the

shall be an affirmative defense that statements, representations, or 
omissions were not made in bad faith (as defined in subparagraphs (B) 
and (C) of section 201(1)) if the sender can demonstrate that such 
statements, representations, or omissions were mistakes made in good 
faith. Evidence that the sender in the usual course of business sends 
written communications that do not violate the provisions of this title 
shall be sufficient to demonstrate good faith. Good faith may also be 
demonstrated by other evidence.

    (b) Powers of Commission.--The Commission shall enforce this title 
in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the

into and made a part of this title. Any person who violates section 202 
shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and 
immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act.

        State, may bring a civil action on behalf of such residents of 
        the State in a district court of the United States of 
        appropriate jurisdiction--
                    (A) to enjoin further such violation by the

            (2) Maximum civil penalty.--Notwithstanding the number of 
        actions which may be brought against a person under this 
        subsection, a person may not be liable for a total of more than 
        $5,000,000 for a series of related violations of section 202.
            (3) Intervention by the ftc.--
                    (A) Notice and intervention.--The attorney general 
                of a State shall provide prior written notice of any 
                action under paragraph (1) to the Commission and 
                provide the Commission with a copy of the complaint in 
                the action, except in any case in which such prior 
                notice is not feasible, in which case the attorney 
                general shall serve such notice immediately upon 
                instituting such action. The Commission shall have the 
                right--
                            (i) to intervene in the action;
                            (ii) upon so intervening, to be heard on 
                        all matters arising therein; and
                            (iii) to file petitions for appeal.
                    (B) Limitation on state action while federal action 
                is pending.--If the Commission has instituted a civil 
                action for violation of section 202, no State attorney 
                general may bring an action under this subsection 
                during the pendency of that action against any 
                defendant named in the complaint of the Commission for 
                any violation of such section alleged in the complaint.
            (4) Construction.--For purposes of bringing any civil 
        action under paragraph (1), nothing in this title shall be 
        construed to prevent the attorney general of a State from 
        exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by the 
        laws of that State to--
                    (A) conduct investigations;
                    (B) administer oaths or affirmations; or
                    (C) compel the attendance of witnesses or the 
                production of documentary and other evidence.
