236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 
1357)--

        subdivision of a State for actions taken in compliance with the 
        detainer; and
            (2) if the actions of the officer, employee, or agent of

purposes of this Act, the term ``sanctuary jurisdiction'' means any

ordinance, policy, or practice that prohibits or restricts any 
government entity or official from--
            (1) sending, receiving, maintaining, or exchanging with any 
        Federal, State, or local government entity information

        unlawful) of any individual; or
            (2) complying with a request lawfully made by the 
        Department of Homeland Security under section 236 or 287 of the

        comply with a detainer for, or notify about the release of, an 
        individual.
    (b) Exception.--A State or political subdivision of a State shall 
not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction based solely on its having a 
policy whereby its officials will not share information regarding, or 
comply with a request made by the Department of Homeland Security under 
section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1226 and 1357) to comply with a detainer regarding, an individual who
