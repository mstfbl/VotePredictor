SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 11, 2001, 19 terrorists, who underwent 
        airport security screening prior to boarding domestic flights, 
        were able to commandeer 4 airplanes and use those airplanes to 
        perpetrate the most deadly terrorist attack ever to be executed 
        on United States soil.
            (2) In the aftermath of those attacks, Congress passed the 
        Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public Law 107-71), 
        which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on 
        November 19, 2001--
                    (A) to enhance the level of security screening 
                throughout our aviation system; and
                    (B) to transfer responsibility for such screening 
                from the private sector to the newly established 
                Transportation Security Administration (referred to in 
                this section as ``TSA'').
            (3) By establishing TSA, Congress and the American public 
        recognized that the highest level of screener performance was 
        directly linked to employment and training standards, pay and 
        benefits, and the creation of an experienced, committed 
        screening workforce.
            (4) Section 111(d) of the Aviation and Transportation 
        Security Act (49 U.S.C. 44935 note) authorizes the Under 
        Secretary of Transportation for Security to ``employ, appoint, 
        discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and 
        conditions of employment of Federal service for such a number 
        of individuals as the Under Secretary determines to be 
        necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under 
        Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United States 
        Code''. The functions of the TSA were transferred to the 
        Department of Homeland Security by section 403 of the Homeland 
        Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 203).
            (5) TSA has interpreted the authorization set forth in 
        paragraph (4) as applying to the majority of the Transportation 
        Security Officer workforce performing screening functions, 
        while all other Transportation Security Administration 
        employees, including managers, are subject to title 5, United 
        States Code, as incorporated in title 49 of such Code.
            (6) In November 2006, the International Labor Organization 
        ruled that the Bush Administration violated international labor 
        law when it prohibited Transportation Security Officers from 
        engaging in collective bargaining.
            (7) After the Federal Labor Relations Board approved a 
        petition for the election of an exclusive representative, on 
        February 4, 2011, TSA Administrator John Pistole issued a 
        binding determination stating that ``it is critical that every 
        TSA employee feels that he or she has a voice and feels safe 
        raising issues and concerns of all kinds. This is important not 
        just for morale; engagement of every employee is critically 
        important for security.''.
            (8) This determination was superseded by a second 
        determination issued on December 29, 2014, which changed the 
        previous guideline for collective bargaining and resulting in 
        limitations in the subjects that can be bargained, issues in 
        dispute that may be raised to an independent, third-party 
        neutral decisionmaker (such as an arbitrator or the Merit 
        Systems Protection Board), and barriers to union representation 
        of the Transportation Security Officer workforce.
            (9) The 2011 and 2014 determinations both cited TSA's 
        authority under section 111(d) of the Aviation and 
        Transportation Security Act (49 U.S.C. 44935 note) to create a 
        personnel system that denies the Transportation Security 
        Officer workforce the rights under title 5, United States Code, 
        that are provided to most other Federal workers, including--
                    (A) the right to appeal adverse personnel decisions 
                to the Merit Systems Protection Board;
                    (B) fair pay under the General Services wage 
                system, 2011;
                    (C) fair pay and raises under the General Services 
                wage system, including overtime guidelines, access to 
                earned leave;
                    (D) the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
                of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.);
                    (E) fair performance appraisals under chapter 73 of 
                title 5, United States Code; and
                    (F) direct protections against employment 
                discrimination set forth in title 7, United States 
                Code.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the personnel system utilized by the Transportation 
        Security Administration pursuant to section 111(d) of the 
        Aviation and Transportation Security Act (49 U.S.C. 44935 note) 
        provides insufficient workplace protections for the 
        Transportation Security Officer workforce, who are the 
        frontline personnel who secure our Nation's aviation system; 
        and
            (2) such personnel should be entitled to the protections 
        under title 5, United States Code.
