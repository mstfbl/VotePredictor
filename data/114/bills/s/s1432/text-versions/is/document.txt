                                 A BILL


 
     To require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on the 
technology, potential lifecycle energy savings, and economic impact of 
             recycled carbon fiber, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Fiber Recycling Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. RECYCLED CARBON FIBER STUDY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) current methods for manufacturing carbon fiber are 
        energy intensive, making carbon fiber costly for use in mass-
        produced applications;
            (2) it takes approximately one-tenth the energy to produce 
        recycled carbon fiber as it does to produce virgin carbon 
        fiber;
            (3) using recycled carbon fiber in the manufacturing 
        process could result in as great as 40 percent in cost savings 
        compared to the manufacture of virgin fiber; and
            (4) up to 30 percent of carbon fiber manufactured becomes 
        part of the waste stream.
    (b) Study.--The Secretary of Energy (referred to in this Act as the 
``Secretary'') shall conduct a study on--
            (1) the technology of recycled carbon fiber and production 
        waste carbon fiber; and
            (2) the potential lifecycle energy savings and economic 
        impact of recycled carbon fiber.
    (c) Factors for Consideration.--In conducting the study under 
subsection (b), the Secretary shall consider--
            (1) the quantity of recycled carbon fiber or production 
        waste carbon fiber that would make the use of recycled carbon 
        fiber or production waste carbon fiber economically viable;
            (2) any existing or potential barriers to recycling carbon 
        fiber or using recycled carbon fiber;
            (3) any financial incentives that may be necessary for the 
        development of recycled carbon fiber or production waste carbon 
        fiber;
            (4) the potential lifecycle savings in energy from 
        producing recycled carbon fiber, as compared to producing new 
        carbon fiber;
            (5) the best and highest use for recycled carbon fiber;
            (6) the potential reduction in carbon dioxide emissions 
        from producing recycled carbon fiber, as compared to producing 
        new carbon fiber;
            (7) any economic benefits gained from using recycled carbon 
        fiber or production waste carbon fiber;
            (8) workforce training and skills needed to address labor 
        demands in the development of recycled carbon fiber or 
        production waste carbon fiber; and
            (9) how the Department of Energy can leverage existing 
        efforts in the industry on the use of production waste carbon 
        fiber.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report describing 
the results of the study conducted under subsection (b).

SEC. 3. RECYCLED CARBON FIBER DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

    The Secretary shall consult with the aviation and automotive 
industries and existing programs of the Advanced Manufacturing Office 
of the Department of Energy to develop a carbon fiber recycling 
demonstration project.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry 
out this Act $10,000,000, to remain available until expended.
                                 <all>
