SEC. 338. STARBASE PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The budget of the President for fiscal year 2017 
        requested no funding for the Department of Defense STARBASE 
        program.
            (2) The purpose of the STARBASE program is to improve the 
        knowledge and skills of students in kindergarten through 12th 
        grade in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
        (STEM) subjects, to connect them to the military, and to 
        motivate them to explore science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics and possible military careers as they continue 
        their education.
            (3) The STARBASE program currently operates at 76 locations 
        in 40 States and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, 
        primarily on military installations.
            (4) To date, nearly 750,000 students have participated in 
        the STARBASE program.
            (5) The STARBASE program is a highly effective program run 
        by dedicated members of the Armed Forces and strengthens the 
        relationships between the military, communities, and local 
        school districts.
            (6) The budget of the President for fiscal year 2017 seeks 
        to eliminate funding for the STARBASE program for that fiscal 
        year due to a reorganization of science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics programs throughout the Federal 
        Government.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
STARBASE program should continue to be funded by the Department of 
Defense.

              TO DESIGNATE PAYMENT OF THE DEATH GRATUITY TO A TRUST FOR 
              A SPECIAL NEEDS INDIVIDUAL.

explore options to allow members of the Armed Forces to designate that, 
upon their death, the death gratuity payable with respect to members of 
the Armed Forces upon death may be paid to a trust that is legally

subsection (a) shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
            (1) The purposes of the Survivor Benefit Plan, the manner 
        in which the Plan interacts with other Federal programs to 
        provide financial stability and resources for survivors of 
        members of the Armed Forces and military retirees, and a 
        comparison between the benefits available under the Plan, on 
        the one hand, and benefits available to Government and private 
        sector employees, on the other hand, intended to provide 
        financial stability and resources for spouses and other 
        dependents when a primary family earner dies.
            (2) The effectiveness of the Survivor Benefit Plan in 
        providing survivors with intended benefits, including the 
        provision of survivor benefits for survivors of members of the 
        Armed Forces dying on active duty and members dying while in 
        reserve active-status.
            (3) The feasibility and advisability of providing survivor 
        benefits through alternative insurance products available 
        commercially for similar purposes, the extent to which the 
        Government could subsidize such products at no cost in excess 
        of the costs of the Survivor Benefit Plan, and the extent to 
        which such products might meet the needs of survivors, 
        especially those on fixed incomes, to maintain financial 
        stability.
    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report

                        Benefits and Operations

SEC. 661. PROTECTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF ACCESS TO AND SAVINGS AT 
              COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES.

    (a) Optimization Strategy.--Section 2481(c) of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following paragraph:
    ``(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall develop and implement a 
comprehensive strategy to optimize management practices across the 
defense commissary system and the exchange system that reduce reliance 
of those systems on appropriated funding without reducing benefits to 
the patrons of those systems or the revenue generated by 
nonappropriated fund entities or instrumentalities of the Department of 
Defense for the morale, welfare, and recreation of members of the armed 
forces.
    ``(B) The Secretary shall ensure that savings generated due to such 
optimization practices are shared by the defense commissary system and 
the exchange system through contracts or agreements that appropriately 
reflect the participation of the systems in the development and 
implementation of such practices.''.
    (b) Authority To Supplement Appropriations Through Business 
Optimization.--Section 2483(c) of such title is amended by adding at 
the end the following new sentence: ``Such appropriated amounts may 
also be supplemented with additional funds derived from improved 
management practices implemented pursuant to sections 2481(c)(3) and 
2487(c) of this title and the alternative pricing program implemented 
pursuant to section 2484(i) of this title.''.
    (c) Alternative Pricing Program.--Section 2484 of such title is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(i) Alternative Pricing Program.--(1) The Secretary of Defense 
may establish and carry out, in accordance with the requirements of 
this subsection, an alternative pricing program pursuant to which 
prices may be established in response to market conditions and customer 
demand. Prices under the alternative pricing program shall reflect the 
uniform sales price surcharge applicable under subsection (d).
    ``(2) Before establishing an alternative pricing program under this 
subsection, the Secretary shall establish the following:
            ``(A) Specific, measurable benchmarks for success in the 
        provision of high quality grocery merchandise, discount savings 
        to patrons, and levels of customer satisfaction while achieving 
        savings for the Department of Defense.
            ``(B) A baseline of overall savings to patrons achieved by 
        commissary stores before the initiation of the alternative 
        pricing program, based on a comparison of prices charged by 
        those stores on a regional basis with prices charged by 
        relevant local competitors for a representative market basket 
        of goods. In determining the savings baseline, the Secretary 
        shall take into account the effect of the surcharges added 
        under the pricing program by reason of subsection (d).
    ``(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the defense commissary system 
implements the alternative pricing program by conducting price 
comparisons using the methodology established for paragraph (2)(B) and 
adjusting pricing as necessary to ensure that pricing in the 
alternative pricing program achieves overall savings to patrons that 
are reasonably consistent with the baseline savings established for the 
relevant region pursuant to such paragraph.
    ``(j) Conversion to Nonappropriated Fund Entity or 
Instrumentality.--(1) If the Secretary of Defense determines that the 
alternative pricing program under subsection (i) has met the benchmarks 
for success established pursuant to subsection (i)(2)(A) and the 
savings requirements established pursuant to subsection (i)(3) over a 
period of at least six months, the Secretary may convert the defense 
commissary system to a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality, 
with operating expenses financed in whole or in part by receipts from 
the sale of products and the sale of services. Upon such conversion, 
appropriated funds shall be transferred to the defense commissary 
system only in accordance with paragraph (2) or section 2491 of this 
title. The requirements of section 2483 of this title shall not apply 
to the defense commissary system operating as a nonappropriated fund 
entity or instrumentality.
    ``(2) If the Secretary determines that the defense commissary 
system operating as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality is 
not likely, in any fiscal year, to afford the level of patron savings 
required in subsection (i)(3), the Secretary may authorize a transfer 
of appropriated funds available for such purpose to the commissary 
system in an amount sufficient to offset the anticipated loss. Any 
funds so transferred shall be considered to be nonappropriated funds 
for such purpose.
    ``(3) The Secretary may identify positions of employees in the 
defense commissary system who are paid with appropriated funds whose 
status may be converted to the status of an employee of a 
nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality. The status and 
conversion of such employees shall be addressed as provided in section 
2491(c) of this title for employees in morale, welfare, and recreation 
programs. No individual who is an employee of the defense commissary 
system as of the date of the enactment of this subsection shall suffer 
any loss of or decrease in pay as a result of the conversion.''.
    (d) Establishment of Common Business Practices.--Section 2487 of 
such title is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection (c):

processes, practices, and systems--

        defense commissary system and the exchange system; and
            ``(B) to optimize the operations of the defense retail 
        systems as a whole and the benefits provided by the 
        commissaries and exchanges.
    ``(2) The Secretary may authorize the defense commissary system and 
the exchange system to enter into contracts or other agreements for the 
following:
            ``(A) Products and services that are shared by the defense 
        commissary system and the exchange system.
            ``(B) The acquisition of supplies, resale goods, and 
        services on behalf of both the defense commissary system and 
        the exchange system.
    ``(3) For the purpose of a contract or agreement authorized under 
paragraph (2), the Secretary may--
            ``(A) use funds appropriated pursuant to section 2483 of 
        this title to reimburse a nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality for the portion of the cost of a contract or 
        agreement entered by the nonappropriated fund entity or 
        instrumentality that is attributable to the defense commissary 
        system; and

SEC. 704. COVERAGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOOD AND VITAMINS FOR 
              DIGESTIVE AND INHERITED METABOLIC DISORDERS UNDER THE 
              TRICARE PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Specialized food is often medically necessary for the 
        safe and effective management of many digestive and inherited 
        metabolic disorders that impact digestion, absorption, and 
        metabolism of nutrients.
            (2) Although medically necessary food is essential for 
        patients, it is often expensive and not uniformly reimbursed by 
        health insurance, leaving many families with an insurmountable 
        financial burden.
            (3) As a result, many patients who cannot afford medically 
        necessary food may experience adverse health consequences from 
        suboptimal disease management, including hospitalization, 
        intellectual impairment, behavioral dysfunction, inadequate 
        growth, nutrient deficiencies, and even death.
    (b) Availability Under the TRICARE Program.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1077 of title 10, United States 
        Code, is amended--
                    (A) in subsection (a)--
                            (i) in paragraph (3), by inserting before 
                        the period at the end the following: ``, 
                        including medically necessary vitamins''; and
                            (ii) by adding at the end the following new 
                        paragraph:
            ``(18) Medically necessary food and the medical equipment 
        and supplies necessary to administer such food (other than 
        medical equipment and supplies described in section 1861(n) of 
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(n))).''; and

                support contract pursuant to the competition of that 
                contract under subparagraph (A).
            (2) Continuous competition.--

                behaviors.
            (5) Coordinate and integrate health care across the 
        continuum of care, connecting all aspects of the health care 
        received by the patient, including the patient's health care 
        team.
            (6) Facilitate access to health care providers, including--

        for the use of a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation 
        methodology in the contract file, if the contract to be awarded

                hours of direct labor required for the production or 
                provision of the products or services.

completing further reconciliation audits or corrective actions other 
than those described in this section. To accomplish closeout of such 
contracts--
            (1) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        in other contract line items within a contract regardless of

                    (A) the records have been destroyed or lost; or
                    (B) the records are available but the contracting 
                officer in collaboration with the certifying official 
                has determined that a discrepancy is of a de minimis 
                value such that the time and effort required to 
                determine the cause of an out-of-balance condition is 
                disproportionate to the amount of the discrepancy.
    (c) Closeout Terms.--The contracts identified in subsection (b) may 
be closed out--
            (1) upon receipt of $581,803 from the contractor to be

for Policy in all matters of policy related to special operations 
activities and low intensity conflict activities of the Department of 
Defense.''.

SEC. 924. PILOT PROGRAM ON ORGANIZATION OF SUBORDINATE COMMANDS OF A 
              UNIFIED COMBATANT COMMAND AS JOINT TASK FORCES.

    (a) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of Defense shall carry out a 
pilot program on organizing the subordinate commands of a unified 
combatant command in the form of joint task forces.
    (b) Covered Commands.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot 
program in at least one unified combatant command designated by the 
Secretary for purposes of this section.
    (c) Plan.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out the pilot program, the 
        Secretary shall develop, for each combatant command 
        participating in the pilot program, a plan to--
                    (A) disestablish, and prohibit the reestablishment 
                of, any subordinate command of such combatant command 
                that is organized by a service of the Armed Forces;
                    (B) identify the major missions and contingencies 
                in the area of responsibility of such combatant command 
                that would require a military response;
                    (C) establish subordinate commands for such 
                combatant command in the form of joint task forces, as 
                described in subsection (d);
                    (D) select a commander of an appropriate grade to 
                lead each joint task force so established based on the 
                scale and complexity of the mission that such task 
                force must perform; and
                    (E) describe any additional authorities, 
                specialized training, or other organizational elements 
                that such joint task forces may require to meet the 
                objectives of the plan.
            (2) Objectives.--The objectives of each plan under this 
        subsection shall be--
                    (A) to provide for a greater emphasis on 
                operational military missions;
                    (B) to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 
                the combatant command concerned in performing the 
                missions of the combatant command through better 
                integration of functional components and capabilities, 
                both from within the combatant command and across the 
                Department of Defense;
                    (C) to create more flexible and responsive 
                subordinate commands that can be established, grown, 
                reduced, altered, or disestablished based on the 
                changing nature of threats and contingencies in the 
                area of responsibility of the combatant command 
                concerned;
                    (D) to devolve responsibility and initiative, to 
                the greatest extent practicable, to lower levels in the 
                combatant command concerned, eliminating unnecessary 
                layers of management and headquarters staff, and 
                reducing the cost and time to perform mission critical 
                tasks;
                    (E) to enhance the ability of the combatant command 
                concerned to execute global defense strategies and 
                address threats that span multiple regions, functions, 
                and domains, involve different durations of time, and 
                lack clearly defined phases of conflict; and
                    (F) to enable the commander of the combatant 
                command concerned to integrate the activities of the 
                combatant command across wider spans of control with 
                fewer personnel and resources, and to focus more 
                consistently on the strategic missions of the combatant 
                command, including coordination with other combatant 
                commands and engagement with key foreign partners.
            (3) Problems to overcome.--The problems that each plan 
        under this subsection shall seek to overcome are--
                    (A) deficiencies in the current organization of the 
                unified combatant commands that have led senior leaders 
                over many years to rely increasingly on the 
                establishment of ad hoc joint task forces to meet 
                critical emergent requirements for the combatant 
                commands;
                    (B) dramatic growth in the size of staffs of the 
                unified combatant commands that inhibit an effective 
                and efficient performance of missions, lead to 
                duplication of effort, and draw limited vital resources 
                away from operational units and toward bureaucratic 
                staffing functions;
                    (C) hierarchal, time-intensive, and resource-
                intensive planning and decision-making processes that 
                are required to compensate for, and attempt to achieve 
                integration among, functional command structures 
                oriented around separate Armed Forces;
                    (D) antiquated approaches to persistent, trans-
                regional, cross-functional, and multi-domain threats 
                that cannot be addressed through discrete and isolated 
                operational plans based on a clear commencement of 
                hostilities leading to combat operations; and
                    (E) misaligned priorities that result in unified 
                combatant commands being overly focused on mission 
                support activities (such as intelligence analysis and 
                regional theater engagement) and insufficiently focused 
                on the operational missions of the combatant commands.
            (4) Preparation.--Each plan under this subsection shall be 
        prepared in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
        of Staff and the commander of the combatant command concerned.
            (5) Deadline for development.--Any plan to be developed 
        under this subsection shall be completed by not later than 
        March 1, 2017.
            (6) Submittal to congress.--Upon completion of the 
        development of a plan under this subsection, the Secretary 
        shall submit such plan to the congressional defense committees.
            (7) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence 
        implementation of each plan developed under this subsection for 
        purposes of the pilot program by not later than September 1, 
        2017.
    (d) Joint Task Forces.--
            (1) In general.--Each joint task force established for 
        purposes of the pilot program pursuant to a plan under 
        subsection (c) shall be--
                    (A) established and organized as a cross-functional 
                team with the primary purpose of performing an 
                identified mission or providing essential support and 
                enabling capabilities to task forces performing such 
                missions;
                    (B) assigned the necessary number and mixture of 
                Armed Forces personnel and related capabilities to 
                perform the mission of such task force;
                    (C) organized and sized in a manner that best 
                reflects the scope, scale, complexity, and priority of 
                the mission that such task force is required to perform 
                or support;
                    (D) comprised of representatives from each 
                functional component from across the Department of 
                Defense that is relevant to the performance of the 
                mission of such task force, including the Armed Forces, 
                other unified combatant commands, other joint task 
                forces that are subordinate to the same or another 
                unified combatant command, defense intelligence 
                agencies, other combat support agencies, and 
                acquisition offices; and
                    (E) commanded by a military officer of appropriate 
                grade who would be selected as prescribed by section 
                164(e) of title 10, United States Code, and overseen by 
                the commander of the combatant command as prescribed by 
                section 164(d) of such title were such joint task force 
                the subordinate command of a unified combatant command.
            (2) Purposes.--The purpose of each joint task force 
        established pursuant to this subsection shall be to achieve the 
        operational military mission of such task force, including by--
                    (A) integrating all the functional components 
                within such task force into joint efforts;
                    (B) producing integrated operational plans, 
                consistent with the orders of the commander of the 
                combatant command concerned and the defense strategy of 
                the Department of Defense;
                    (C) recommending to the commander of the combatant 
                command concerned any additional resources and 
                capabilities that the commander of such joint task 
                force determines necessary to achieve the mission of 
                such task force;
                    (D) providing better alignment and unity of effort 
                with other joint task forces within the combatant 
                command concerned or other unified combatant commands 
                that are performing related missions or addressing 
                similar threats;
                    (E) conducting engagements with foreign partners 
                from the area of responsibility of such task force that 
                are necessary to achieving the military mission of such 
                task force; and
                    (F) experimenting with new operational concepts and 
                developmental capabilities that the commander of such 
                task force considers essential to the mission of such 
                task force.
    (e) Report.--Not later than September 1, 2018, the Secretary shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report that includes, 
for each plan developed under subsection (c) for purposes of the pilot 
program, the following:
            (1) A description of such plan.
            (2) An assessment of the positive and negative effects of 
        such plan.

Subtitle C--Organization and Management of Other Department of Defense 
                          Offices and Elements

SEC. 941. ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Organizational Strategy Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than July 20, 2017, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall formulate and issue to the 
        Department of Defense an organizational strategy for the 
        Department that--
                    (A) identifies the most important missions and 
                other organizational outputs for the Department, 
                including the manner in which capabilities for such 
                missions will be generated and objectives for such 
                outputs will be achieved;
                    (B) reforms the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
                and the manner in which it operates to support the 
                Secretary;
                    (C) improves management of relationships and 
                processes involving the Office of the Secretary of 
                Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the combatant 
                commands, the military departments, and the Defense 
                Agencies;
                    (D) improves and professionalizes the supervision 
                of the Defense Agencies; and
                    (E) improves support to the President and the 
                National Security Council in interagency processes and 
                deliberations.
            (2) Objectives.--The objectives of the strategy shall be as 
        follows:
                    (A) To enable the Department to integrate the 
                expertise and capacities of the components of the 
                Department for effective and efficient achievement of 
                the missions of the Department.
                    (B) To enable the Department to focus on critical 
                missions that span multiple functional issues, to frame 
                competing and alternative courses of action, and to 
                make clear and effective strategic choices in a timely 
                manner to achieve such missions.
                    (C) To clarify responsibility and accountability in 
                the decision-making processes in the Department.
                    (D) To enable the Department to anticipate, adapt, 
                and innovate rapidly to changes in the threats facing 
                the United States, and to exploit the opportunities to 
                counter such threats offered by technological and 
                organizational advances.
                    (E) To improve the ability of the Department to 
                work effectively in interagency processes in order to 
                better serve the President and the National Security 
                Council and to better contribute to national security 
                missions.
                    (F) To achieve an organizational structure with 
                fewer layers of management and reduced levels of 
                staffing that performs better than the current 
                organizational structure of the Department.
            (3) Impediments to be addressed.--The strategy shall 
        address, and seek to overcome, the following:
                    (A) Sequential, hierarchical planning and decision-
                making processes oriented around functional 
                bureaucratic structures that are excessively parochial, 
                duplicative, resistant to integration, and result in 
                unclear, consensus-based outcomes that often constrain 
                the ability of the Department to achieve core missions 
                effectively and efficiently.
                    (B) Layering of management structures and processes 
                that result in decisions being made by higher levels of 
                management where the authority for cross-functional 
                integration exists but detailed substantive expertise 
                is often lacking or being reduced to lowest common 
                denominator recommendations to senior leaders that 
                suppress rather than resolve disputes across functional 
                organizations.
                    (C) Weak leadership skills and culture in the 
                Office of the Secretary of Defense.
                    (D) Misaligned incentives and a culture that 
                rewards bureaucratic parochialism and inertia, risk 
                avoidance, and the deferral or delay of decisions.
            (4) Causes of impediments to be eliminated.--In connection 
        with the impediments specified in paragraph (3), the strategy 
        shall address, and seek to eliminate, the following:
                    (A) A noncollaborative culture within the 
                Department that lacks shared purpose and values.
                    (B) Risk aversion arising from fear of the 
                consequences of real or perceived failure, or from the 
                absence of positive or negative incentives to reduce 
                such risk aversion.
                    (C) Lack of viable alternative mechanisms for 
                achieving the integration of the functional components 
                of the Department and for aligning expertise and 
                decision-making authority at the most efficient levels 
                of management.
            (5) Solutions.--In connection with the impediments 
        specified in paragraph (3) and the causes of such impediments 
        specified in paragraph (4), the strategy shall specify, and 
        seek to achieve, the following:
                    (A) Cross-functional teams to manage the major 
                missions and other high-priority outputs of the 
                Department that inherently cross functional boundaries 
                (in this section referred to as ``mission teams'').

        case officers (as proposed by the Director of the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency for the Defense Clandestine Service).
            (3) Whether a consolidated clandestine human intelligence 
        collection organization charged with meeting the needs of the

        Central Intelligence Agency.
            (4) Whether it is more effective and efficient to provide 
        support and perform oversight of the consolidated organization 
        described in paragraph (3) through the Directorate of

        (NIP).

            (1) the fiscal challenges of the Nation are a top priority 
        for Congress, and sequestration--nonstrategic, across-the-board 
        budget cuts--remains an unreasonable and inadequate budgeting 
        tool to address the deficits and debt of the United States;
            (2) sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal 
        years 2018 through 2021, the remaining years of the 
        discretionary spending caps under the Budget Control Act of 
        2011;
            (3) sequestration relief should include both defense and 
        nondefense relief; and
            (4) sequestration relief should be offset through targeted 
        changes in mandatory and discretionary spending and revenues.

              INDIVIDUALS DETAINED AT UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, 
              GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO COUNTRIES COVERED BY DEPARTMENT 
              OF STATE TRAVEL WARNINGS.

    (a) Finding.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of State issues travel warnings 
        regarding travel to foreign countries for reasons that include 
        ``unstable government, civil war, ongoing intense crime or 
        violence, or frequent terrorist attacks''.
            (2) These travel warnings are issued to highlight the 
        ``risks of traveling'' to particular countries and are left in 
        place until the situation in the country concerned improves.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) countries that pose such a significant travel threat to 
        United States citizens that the Department of State feels 
        obliged to issue a travel warning should not be considered an 
        appropriate recipient of any detainee transferred from United 
        States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and
            (2) if a country is subject to a Department of State travel 
        warning, it is highly unlikely that the government of the 
        country can provide the United States Government appropriate 
        security and assurances regarding the prevention of the 
        recidivism of any detainee so transferred.
    (c) Prohibition.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs and (2) 
        and (3), no amounts authorized to be appropriated by this Act 
        or otherwise available for the Department of Defense may be 
        used, during the period beginning on the date of the enactment 
        of this Act and ending on December 31, 2017, to transfer, 
        release, or assist in the transfer or release of any individual 
        detained in the custody or under the control of the Department 
        of Defense at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay to 
        the custody or control of any country subject to a Department 
        of State travel warning at the time the transfer or release 
        would otherwise occur.
            (2) Exception for certain warnings.--Paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply with respect to any country subject to a travel 
        warning described in that paragraph that is issued solely on 
        the basis of one or more of the following:
                    (A) Medical deficiencies, infectious disease 
                outbreaks, or other health-related concerns.
                    (B) A natural disaster.
                    (C) Criminal activity.
            (3) Exception for certain country.--Paragraph (1) shall not 
        apply with respect to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

                    (A) adversary integrated air defense systems (IADS) 
                have created regions where fourth generation airborne 
                systems may be limited in their ability to effectively 
                operate;
                    (B) adversary aircraft, air-to-air missiles, and 
                airborne electronic attack or electronic protection 
                systems are advancing beyond the capabilities of fourth 
                generation airborne systems; and
                    (C) fifth generation airborne systems provide a 
                wider variety of options for a given warfighting 
                challenge, preserve the technological advantage of the 
                United States over near-peer threats, and serve as a 
                force multiplier by increasing situational awareness 
                and combat effectiveness of fourth generation airborne 
                systems.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
development and fielding of fifth generation airborne system systems 
should include the following:
            (1) Multispectral (radar, infrared, visual, emissions) low 
        observable (LO) design features, self-protection jamming, and 
        other capabilities that significantly delay or deny threat 
        system detection, tracking, and engagement.
            (2) Integrated avionics that autonomously fuse and 
        prioritize onboard multispectral sensors and offboard 
        information data to provide an accurate realtime operating 
        picture and data download for postmission exploitation and 
        analysis.
            (3) Resilient communications, navigation, and 
        identification techniques designed to effectively counter 
        adversary attempts to deny or confuse friendly systems.
            (4) Robust and secure networks linking individual platforms 
        to create a common, accurate, and highly integrated picture of 
        the battle space for friendly forces.
            (5) Advanced onboard diagnostics capable of monitoring 
        system health, accurately reporting system faults, and 
        increasing overall system performance and reliability.
            (6) Integrated platform and subsystem designs to maximize 
        lethality and survivability while enabling decision 
        superiority.
            (7) Maximum consideration for the fielding of unmanned 
        platforms either employed in concert with fifth generation 
        manned platforms or as standalone unmanned platforms, to 
        increase warfighting effectiveness and reduce risk to personnel 
        during high risk missions.
            (8) Advanced air-to-air, air-to-ground, and other weapons 
        able to leverage fifth generation capabilities.
            (9) Comprehensive and high-fidelity live, virtual, and 
        constructive training systems, updated range infrastructure, 
        and sufficient threat-representative adversary training assets 
        to maximize fifth generation force proficiency, effectiveness, 
        and readiness while protecting sensitive capabilities.

                warfare, there continues to be a continuous or 
                potential need for a military selective service process 
                designed to produce large numbers of combat members of 
                the Armed Forces, and if so, whether such a system 
                should include mandatory registration by all citizens 
                and residents, regardless of sex.
                    (B) The need, and how best to meet the need, of the 
                Nation, the military, the Federal civilian sector, and

            (1) support day-to-day air refueling operations, combatant 
        commander operations plans, and flexibility for contingency 
        ops, and have--
                    (A) a strategic location that is essential to the 
                defense of the United States and its interests;
                    (B) receivers for boom or probe-and-drogue training 
                opportunities with joint and international partners; 
                and
                    (C) sufficient airfield and airspace availability 
                and capacity to meet requirements; and
            (2) possess facilities that--
                    (A) take full advantage of existing infrastructure 
                to provide--
                            (i) runway, hangars, and aircrew and 
                        maintenance operations; and
                            (ii) sufficient fuels receipt, storage, and 
                        distribution for 5-day peacetime operating 
                        stock; and
                    (B) minimize overall construction and operational 
                costs.

        and European partners of the United States are indispensable to 
        addressing global security challenges;
            (2) the security and stability of Europe is an enduring 
        vital national security interest of the United States;
            (3) while the investments of the United States are 
        important to the security and stability of Europe, the 
        investments of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and 
        European partners in developing and employing their own 
        security capabilities should meet or exceed such investments of 
        the United States, including in efforts such as the European 
        Deterrence Initiative;
            (4) Congress expects an increase in the forward presence of 
        the military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies and European partners, especially by the most capable 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies; and
            (5) the forces described in paragraph (4) must be 
        interoperable with the additional United States troops in 
        Eastern Europe, as enabled by the European Deterrence 
        Initiative, and are a critical component of the forward 
        presence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to provide 
        improved collective security and increased effective 
        deterrence.
    (b) Accounting of European Investment.--Not later than 60 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
shall present to the congressional defense committees an accounting of 
European investment in security capabilities including current and 
planned efforts to contribute to global security operations such as 
maintaining security and stability in Afghanistan and countering the 
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, programs and projects designed to 
deter Russia and maintain the security and stability of Europe, and any 
other initiative that matches or compliments the efforts the United 
States is making (such as the European Deterrence Initiative).
    (c) Elements.--The accounting presented pursuant to subsection (b) 
shall include the following:
            (1) A summary of the major outcomes of the 2014 NATO Wales 
        Summit and the 2016 NATO Warsaw Summit including progress 
        towards fulfilment of pledges to increase defense spending as 
        agreed to by Heads of State and Government.
            (2) A description of initiatives by other members of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European partners to--
                    (A) deter security challenges posed by Russia;
                    (B) increase capabilities to respond to 
                unconventional or hybrid warfare tactics such as those 
                used by the Russian Federation to annex Crimea and 
                foment instability in Eastern Ukraine;
                    (C) enhance security in Europe in ways that match 
                or exceed United States contributions to conventional 
                deterrence in the region;
                    (D) contribute to the counter-Islamic State of Iraq 
                and the Levant campaign and the North Atlantic Treaty 
                Organization-led mission in Afghanistan; and

SEC. 1251. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SECURITY SECTOR ASSISTANCE.

            (1) United States security sector assistance is aimed at 
        strengthening the ability of United States allies and partner 
        nations to build their own security capacity, consistent with 
        the principles of good governance and rule of law;
            (2) in an environment of limited resources and diverse 
        security challenges, it is essential that the United States be 
        selective and focus targeted assistance where it can be most 
        effective and where it is most aligned with broader foreign 
        policy and national security objectives of the United States;
            (3) the goals of United States security sector assistance

                rights;
                    (D) strengthen collective security and 
                multinational defense arrangements and organizations; 
                and
                    (E) promote the adoption of United States products 
                and technology, which increases interoperability and 
                interdependence;
            (4) the Department of State is the coordinator of United 
        State foreign policy, and is responsible for policy direction 
        on all matters relating to security sector assistance;
            (5) the Department of Defense provides critical 
        implementing support to the Department of State on security 
        assistance programs, and conducts critical security cooperation 
        programs of its own;
            (6) other United States Government agencies, such as the 
        United States Agency for International Development, the 
        Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice, and the 
        Department of Homeland Security, also play critical roles in 
        executing a whole-of-government approach to security sector 
        assistance;
            (7) security sector assistance must be discharged as a 
        shared responsibility across all departments and agencies of 
        the United States Government, with all departments and agencies 
        operating with a shared commitment to agility, effectiveness, 
        and coordination; and
            (8) as the two leading implementers of security sector 
        assistance, the Department of State and Department of Defense 
        should work collaboratively in all matters relating to security 
        sector assistance, including by undertaking joint planning to 
        determine the best application of security sector assistance 
        programs under title 10, United States Code, the Foreign 
        Assistance Act of 1961, and other laws relating to such 
        programs for the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        State, particularly when the United States Government seeks to 
        introduce a significant new military capability into a foreign 
        country or region, significantly enhance the security capacity 
        of a foreign country, or engage a diplomatically sensitive 
        foreign country.

        western Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and the United 
        States territory of Guam.
            (2) The United States and Palau have forged close security, 
        economic and cultural ties since the United States defeated the 
        armed forces of Imperial Japan in Palau in 1944.
            (3) The United States administered Palau as a District of 
        the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 
        1947 to 1994.
            (4) In 1994, the United States and Palau entered into a 50-
        year Compact of Free Association which provided for the 
        independence of Palau and set forth the terms for close and 
        mutually beneficial relations in security, economic, and 
        governmental affairs.
            (5) The security terms of the Compact grant the United 
        States full authority and responsibility for the security and 
        defense of Palau, including the exclusive right to deny any 
        nation's military forces access to the territory of Palau 
        except the United States, an important element of our Pacific 
        strategy for defense of the United States homeland, and the 
        right to establish and use defense sites in Palau.
            (6) The Compact entitles any citizen of Palau to volunteer 
        for service in the United States Armed Forces, and they do so 
        at a rate that exceeds that of any of the 50 States.
            (7) In 2009, and in accordance with section 432 of the 
        Compact, the United States and Palau reviewed their overall 
        relationship. In 2010, the two nations signed an agreement 
        updating and extending several provisions of the Compact, 
        including an extension of United States financial and program 
        assistance to Palau, and establishing increased post-9/11 
        immigration protections. However, the United States has not yet 
        approved this Agreement or provided the assistance as called 
        for in the Agreement.
            (8) Beginning in 2010 and most recently on February 22, 
        2016, the Department of the Interior, the Department of State, 
        and the Department of Defense have sent letters to Speaker of 
        the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of 
        the Senate transmitting the legislation to approve the 2010 
        United States Palau Agreement including an analysis of the 
        budgetary impact of the legislation.
            (9) The February 22, 2016, letter concluded, ``Approving 
        the results of the Agreement is important to the national 
        security of the United States, stability in the Western Pacific 
        region, our bilateral relationship with Palau and to the United 
        States' broader strategic interest in the Asia-Pacific 
        region.''
            (10) On May 20, 2016, the Department of Defense submitted a 
        letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the congressional 
        defense committees in support of including legislation enacting 
        the agreement in the fiscal year 2017 National Defense 
        Authorization Act and concluded that its inclusion advances 
        United States national security objectives in the region.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) to fulfill the promise and commitment of the United 
        States to its ally, the Republic of Palau, and reaffirm this 
        special relationship and strengthen the ability of the United 
        States to defend the homeland, Congress and the President 
        should promptly enact the Compact Review Agreement signed by 
        the United States and Palau in 2010; and
            (2) Congress and the President should immediately seek a 
        mutually acceptable solution to approving the Compact Review 
        Agreement and ensuring adequate budgetary resources are 
        allocated to meet United States obligations under the Compact 
        through enacting legislation, including through this Act.

SEC. 1654. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR DETERRENCE.

    The following is the sense of Congress:
            (1) The nuclear forces of the United States continue to 
        play a fundamental role in deterring aggression against the 
        interests of the United States and its allies in an 
        increasingly dangerous world in which foreign adversaries, 
        including the Russian Federation, are making explicit nuclear 
        threats against the United States and its allies. Strong United 
        States nuclear forces assure United States allies that the 
        extended deterrence guarantees of the United States are 
        credible and that the resolve of the United States remains 
        strong even in the face of nuclear provocations, including 
        nuclear coercion and blackmail.
            (2) The prevention of war through effective deterrence 
        requires survivable and flexible nuclear forces that are well 
        exercised and ready to respond to nuclear escalation if 
        necessary. Possessing a range of capabilities and options to 
        counter nuclear threats assures United States allies and 
        enhances the credibility of United States nuclear deterrence by 
        reinforcing the resolve of the United States in the minds of 
        United States allies and potential adversaries.
            (3) The declared policy of the United States with respect 
        to the use of nuclear weapons must be coordinated and 
        communicate clearly that the use of nuclear weapons against the 
        United States or its vital interests would ultimately fail and 
        subject the aggressor to incalculable consequences.
            (4) In support of a strong and credible nuclear deterrent, 
        the United States must--
                    (A) maintain a nuclear force with a diverse, 
                flexible range of nuclear yield and delivery modes that 
                are ready, capable, and credible;
                    (B) afford the highest priority to the 
                modernization of the nuclear triad, dual-capable 
                aircraft, and related command and control elements; and
                    (C) ensure the broadest participation of United 
                States allies in nuclear defense planning, training, 
                and exercises to demonstrate the commitment of the 
                United States and its allies and their solidarity 
                against nuclear threats and coercion.
            (5) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) must make 
        it clear at the NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2016 
        that NATO has taken steps to address the nuclear provocations 
        of the Russian Federation, particularly including steps to 
        counter any calculation by the Russian Federation that the use 
        of nuclear weapons against NATO members could have other than 
        incalculable consequences for the Russian Federation. Effective 
        deterrence requires that NATO clearly communicate that reality 
        to the leaders of the Russian Federation, conduct realistic 
        nuclear planning and exercises, and modernize the full suite of 
        dual-capable aircraft and associated command and control 
        networks and facilities.

SEC. 1655. EXPEDITED DECISION WITH RESPECT TO SECURING LAND-BASED 
              MISSILE FIELDS.

    To mitigate any risk posed to the nuclear forces of the United 
States by the failure to replace the UH-1N helicopter, the Secretary of 
Defense shall, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff--

        helicopters meet security requirements and if there are any 
        shortfalls or gaps in meeting such requirements;
            (2) not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, submit to Congress a report on the decision 
        relating to a request for forces required by paragraph (1); and
            (3) if the Chairman determines the implementation of the 
        decision to be warranted to mitigate any risk posed to the 
        nuclear forces of the United States--
                    (A) not later than 60 days after such date of 
                enactment, implement that decision; or
                    (B) if the Secretary cannot implement that decision 
                during the period specified in subparagraph (A), not 
                later than 45 days after such date of enactment, submit 
                to Congress a report that includes a proposal for the 
                date by which the Secretary can implement that decision 
                and a plan to carry out that proposal.

        review and decide special issuance cases.
    (h) Report Required.--Not later than 5 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in coordination with the 
National Transportation Safety Board, shall submit to the Committee on

except paragraph (5) of that subsection, unless the Administrator has 
published final regulations in the Federal Register under that 
subsection.
    (j) Covered Aircraft Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered

        individual's ability to safely operate a covered aircraft under 
        the third-class medical certificate exemption in subsection 
        (a), the Administrator may require the individual to provide 
        additional information or history so that the Administrator may 
        determine whether the individual is safe to continue operating 
        a covered aircraft.
            (2) Use of information.--The Administrator may use credible 
        or urgent information received under paragraph (1) to request

administration in the Department of Transportation. The mission of the 
Maritime Administration is to foster, promote, and develop the merchant 
maritime industry of the United States.
    ``(b) Maritime Administrator.--The head of the Maritime 
Administration is the Maritime Administrator, who is appointed by the 
President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The 
Administrator shall report directly to the Secretary of Transportation 
and carry out the duties prescribed by the Secretary.
    ``(c) Deputy Maritime Administrator.--The Maritime Administration 
shall have a Deputy Maritime Administrator, who is appointed in the 
competitive service by the Secretary, after consultation with the 
Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall carry out the duties 
prescribed by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator shall be 
Acting Administrator during the absence or disability of the 
Administrator and, unless the Secretary designates another individual,

    ``(d) Duties and Powers Vested in Secretary.--All duties and powers 
of the Maritime Administration are vested in the Secretary.
    ``(e) Regional Offices.--The Maritime Administration shall have

officer's pay and allowances as an officer in the armed forces, makes 
the officer's total pay and allowances equal to the amount that would 
be paid to an individual performing work the Secretary considers to be 
of similar importance, difficulty, and responsibility as that performed 
by the officer during the detail.
    ``(h) Contracts, Cooperative Agreements, and Audits.--
            ``(1) Contracts and cooperative agreements.--In the same 
        manner that a private corporation may make a contract within

        Government and disburse amounts to--

        date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall 
        prescribe interim guidance for use in sentencing at courts-
        martial before the implementation of sentencing parameters and 
        criteria pursuant to the regulations referred to in paragraph 
        (1). Insofar as the President considers practicable, the 
        interim guidance shall be consistent with the purposes and 
        procedures set forth in subsections (c) and (d) of section 856 
        of title 10, United States Code (article 56 of the Uniform Code 
        of Military Justice), as so amended, taking into account the

                Maximums.--''; and
                    (B) by striking subsection (b); and
            (2) section 853a of title 10, United States Code (article 
        53a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), as added by

        (c) and (d) and inserting the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Limitation on Acceptance of Plea Agreements.--The military 
judge shall reject a plea agreement that--
            ``(1) contains a provision that has not been accepted by

Justice), as amended by subsection (a), only if the sentence is 
adjudged on or after the effective date of the interim guidance 
prescribed under subsection (c)(2).

SEC. 5262. EFFECTIVE DATE OF SENTENCES.

    (a) In General.--Section 857 of title 10, United States Code 
(article 57 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), is amended to 
read as follows:
``Sec. 857. Art. 57. Effective date of sentences
    ``(a) Execution of Sentences.--A court-martial sentence shall be 
executed and take effect as follows:
            ``(1) Forfeiture and reduction.--A forfeiture of pay or 
        allowances shall be applicable to pay and allowances accruing 
        on and after the date on which the sentence takes effect. Any 
        forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that is 
        included in a sentence of a court-martial takes effect on the 
        earlier of--
                    ``(A) the date that is 14 days after the date on 
                which the sentence is adjudged; or
                    ``(B) in the case of a summary court-martial, the 
                date on which the sentence is approved by the convening 
                authority.
            ``(2) Confinement.--Any period of confinement included in a 
        sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the 
        sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during 
        which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred 
        shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of 
        confinement.
            ``(3) Approval of sentence of death.--If the sentence of 
        the court-martial extends to death, that part of the sentence 
        providing for death may not be executed until approved by the 
        President. In such a case, the President may commute, remit, or 
        suspend the sentence, or any part thereof, as the President 
        sees fit. That part of the sentence providing for death may not 
        be suspended.
            ``(4) Approval of dismissal.--If in the case of a 
        commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, the sentence of a 
        court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of the sentence 
        providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by 
        the Secretary concerned or such Under Secretary or Assistant 
        Secretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned. In 
        such a case, the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Assistant 
        Secretary, as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend 
        the sentence, or any part of the sentence, as the Secretary 
        sees fit. In time of war or national emergency he or she may 
        commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted 
        grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the 
        duration of the war or emergency and six months thereafter.
            ``(5) Completion of appellate review.--If a sentence 
        extends to death, dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct 
        discharge, that part of the sentence extending to death, 
        dismissal, or a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may be 
        executed, in accordance with service regulations, after 
        completion of appellate review (and, with respect to death or 
        dismissal, approval under paragraph (3) or (4), as 
        appropriate).
            ``(6) Other sentences.--Except as otherwise provided in 
        this subsection, a general or special court-martial sentence is 
        effective upon entry of judgment and a summary court-martial 
        sentence is effective when the convening authority acts on the 
        sentence.
    ``(b) Deferral of Sentences.--
            ``(1) In general.--On application by an accused, the 
        convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under his 
        or her jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-
        martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is 
        currently assigned, may, in his or her sole discretion, defer 
        the effective date of a sentence of confinement, reduction, or 
        forfeiture. The deferment shall terminate upon entry of 
        judgment or, in the case of a summary court-martial, when the 
        convening authority acts on the sentence. The deferment may be 
        rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the 
        accused is no longer under his or her jurisdiction, by the 
        officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the 
        command to which the accused is currently assigned.
            ``(2) Deferral of certain persons sentenced to 
        confinement.--In any case in which a court-martial sentences a 
        person referred to in paragraph (3) to confinement, the 
        convening authority may defer the service of the sentence to 
        confinement, without the consent of that person, until after 
        the person has been permanently released to the armed forces by 
        a State or foreign country referred to in that paragraph.
            ``(3) Covered persons.--Paragraph (2) applies to a person 
        subject to this chapter who--
                    ``(A) while in the custody of a State or foreign 
                country is temporarily returned by that State or 
                foreign country to the armed forces for trial by court-
                martial; and
                    ``(B) after the court-martial, is returned to that 
                State or foreign country under the authority of a 
                mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.
            ``(4) State defined.--In this subsection, the term `State' 
        includes the District of Columbia and any Commonwealth, 
        territory, or possession of the United States.
            ``(5) Deferral while review pending.--In any case in which 
        a court-martial sentences a person to confinement, but in which 
        review of the case under section 867(a)(2) of this title 
        (article 67(a)(2)) is pending, the Secretary concerned may 
        defer further service of the sentence to confinement while that 
        review is pending.
    ``(c) Appellate Review.--
            ``(1) Completion of appellate review.--Appellate review is 
        complete under this section when--
                    ``(A) a review under section 865 of this title 
                (article 65) is completed; or

                Appeals or the sentence includes death, and review is
