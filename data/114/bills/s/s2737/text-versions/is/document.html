            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting after subparagraph (B) 
        the following new subparagraphs:
                    ``(C)(i) Any person may submit a request for 
                recognition under subparagraph (A) of all or part of an 
                appropriate standard established by a nationally or 
                internationally recognized standard organization.
                    ``(ii) Not later than 60 calendar days after the 
                Secretary receives such a request, the Secretary 
                shall--
                            ``(I) make a determination to recognize 
                        all, part, or none of the standard that is the 
                        subject of the request; and
                            ``(II) issue to the person who submitted 
                        such request a response in writing that states 
                        the Secretary's rationale for that 
                        determination, including the scientific, 
                        technical, regulatory, or other basis for such 
                        determination.
                    ``(iii) The Secretary shall take such actions as 
                may be necessary to implement all or part of a standard 
                recognized under subclause (I) of clause (ii), in 
                accordance with subparagraph (A).
                    ``(D) The Secretary shall make publicly available, 
                in such manner as the Secretary determines appropriate, 
                the rationale for recognition of all, part, or none of 
                a standard, including the scientific, technical, 
                regulatory, or other basis for the decision regarding 
                such recognition.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Training on use of standards.--The Secretary shall 
        provide to all employees of the Food and Drug Administration 
        who review premarket submissions for devices periodic training 
        on the concept and use of recognized standards for purposes of 
        meeting a premarket submission requirement or other applicable 
        requirement under this Act, including standards relevant to an 
        employee's area of device review.''.
    (b) Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall review and update, if 
necessary, previously published guidance and standard operating 
procedures identifying the principles for recognizing standards, and 
for withdrawing the recognition of standards, under section 514(c) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360d(c)), taking 
into account the experience with and reliance on a standard by foreign 
regulatory authorities and the device industry, and whether recognition 
of a standard will promote harmonization among regulatory authorities 
in the regulation of devices.

                        no longer requires a report under subsection 
                        (k) to provide reasonable assurance of safety 
                        and effectiveness; and

                inserting ``1 calendar day after the date of 
                publication of the final list under paragraph 
                (1)(B),''; and

        manufacturers that have agreed to participate in a pilot 
        project under this subsection with the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services.
            (5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        limit the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services to provide for alternative methods of medical device 
        reporting under part 803 of title 21, Code of Federal 
        Regulations (or successor regulations), including such methods
