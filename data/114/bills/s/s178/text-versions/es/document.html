SEC. 109. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, defines a 
        sex trafficker as a person who ``knowingly. . .recruits, 
        entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains 
        by any means a person. . .knowing, or in reckless disregard of 
        the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, 
        coercion. . .or any combination of such means will be used to 
        cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the 
        person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused 
        to engage in a commercial sex act'';
            (2) while use of the word ``obtains'' in section 1591, 
        United States Code, has been interpreted, prior to the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to encompass those who purchase illicit 
        sexual acts from trafficking victims, some confusion persists;
            (3) in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. 
        2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth 
        Circuit ruled that section 1591 of title 18, United States 
        Code, applied to persons who purchase illicit sexual acts with 
        trafficking victims after the United States District Court for 
        the District of South Dakota erroneously granted motions to 
        acquit these buyers in two separate cases; and
            (4) section 108 of this title amends section 1591 of title 
        18, United States Code, to add the words ``solicits or 
        patronizes'' to the sex trafficking statute making absolutely 
        clear for judges, juries, prosecutors, and law enforcement 
        officials that criminals who purchase sexual acts from human 
        trafficking victims may be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted 
        as sex trafficking offenders when this is merited by the facts 
        of a particular case.

    This title may be cited as the ``Human Exploitation Rescue 
Operations Act of 2015'' or the ``HERO Act of 2015''.

SEC. 302. HERO ACT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution 
        of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the 
        United States. International demand for this material creates a 
        powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children 
        within the United States.
            (2) The targeting of United States children by 
        international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland 
        security of the United States. This threat must be fought with 
        trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-
        exploitation strategies and technologies.
            (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical 
        national security role in protecting the United States from the 
        growing international threat of child exploitation and human 
        trafficking.
            (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national 
        resource in the effort to combat international child 
        exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in 
        investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.
            (5) The returning military heroes of the United States 
        possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law 
        enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, 
        and the Department of Homeland Security should use this 
        national resource to the maximum extent possible.
            (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) 
        Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of 
        the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes 
        of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue 
        children from sexual abuse and slavery.
    (b) Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Investigations Unit, 
and Computer Forensics Unit.--
            (1) In general.--Subtitle H of title VIII of the Homeland

                 TITLE IV--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child Custody Act''.

SEC. 402. DEFINITIONS.

    In this title:
            (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula 
        grant'' means a grant under--
                    (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control 
                and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) 
                (commonly referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against 
                Women Formula Grant Program''); or
                    (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act 
                of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the 
                ``Sexual Assault Services Program'').
            (2) Termination.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, 
                when used with respect to parental rights, a complete 
                and final termination of the parent's right to custody 
                of, guardianship of, visitation with, access to, and 
                inheritance from a child.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to require a State, in 
                order to receive an increase in the amount provided to 
                the State under the covered formula grants under this 
                title, to have in place a law that terminates any 
                obligation of a person who fathered a child through 
                rape to support the child.

SEC. 403. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Men who father children through rape should be 
        prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.
            (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in 
        the United States.
            (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their 
        child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face custody 
        battles with their rapists.
            (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious 
        crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in less 
        than 5 percent of rapes.
            (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most 
        common standard for termination of parental rights among the 50 
        States, territories, and the District of Columbia.
            (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and 
        convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for 
        allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in 
        Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).
            (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape 
        survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights of 
        the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the 
        child was conceived through rape.
            (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the 
        survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which 
        can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and 
        can make it more difficult for her to recover.
            (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely 
        negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.
            (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or 
        parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape, 
        or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.

SEC. 404. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED.

    The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to a State 
under the covered formula grants in accordance with this title if the 
State has in place a law that allows the mother of any child that was 
conceived through rape to seek court-ordered termination of the 
parental rights of her rapist with regard to that child, which the 
court is authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of 
rape.

SEC. 405. APPLICATION.

    A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the State 
under the covered formula grants shall include in the application of 
the State for each covered formula grant such information as the 
Attorney General may reasonably require, including information about 
the law described in section 404.

SEC. 406. GRANT INCREASE.

    The amount of the increase provided to a State under the covered 
formula grants under this title shall be equal to not more than 10 
percent of the average of the total amount of funding provided to the 
State under the covered formula grants under the 3 most recent awards 
to the State.

SEC. 407. PERIOD OF INCREASE.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an increase in 
the amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under 
this title for a 2-year period.
    (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an increase in the 
amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this 
title more than 4 times.

SEC. 408. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.

    The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the amount 
provided to a State under the covered formula grants under this title 
such that--
            (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under 
        the program described in section 402(1)(A); and
            (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under 
        the program described in section 402(1)(B).

SEC. 409. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this title 
$5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2019.

                TITLE V--MILITARY SEX OFFENDER REPORTING

                            conviction.''.
