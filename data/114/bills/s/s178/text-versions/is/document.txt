            (2) Nonprofit organization requirements.--
                    (A) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph and 
                covered grants, the term ``nonprofit organization'' 
                means an organization that is described in section 
                501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is 
                exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code.
                    (B) Prohibition.--The Attorney General may not 
                award a covered grant to a nonprofit organization that 
                holds money in offshore accounts for the purpose of 
                avoiding paying the tax described in section 511(a) of 
                the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
                    (C) Disclosure.--Each nonprofit organization that 
                is awarded a covered grant and uses the procedures 
                prescribed in regulations to create a rebuttable 
                presumption of reasonableness for the compensation of 
                its officers, directors, trustees and key employees, 
                shall disclose to the Attorney General, in the 
                application for the grant, the process for determining 
                such compensation, including the independent persons 
                involved in reviewing and approving such compensation, 
                the comparability data used, and contemporaneous 
                substantiation of the deliberation and decision. Upon 
                request, the Attorney General shall make the 
                information disclosed under this subsection available 
                for public inspection.

                or by any individual or organization awarded 
                discretionary funds through a cooperative agreement 
                under this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, to 
                host or support any expenditure for conferences that 
                uses more than $20,000 in Department funds, unless the 
                Deputy Attorney General or such Assistant Attorney 
                Generals, Directors, or principal deputies as the
