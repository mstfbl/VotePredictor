SEC. 109. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, defines a 
        sex trafficker as a person who ``knowingly. . .recruits, 
        entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains 
        by any means a person. . .knowing, or in reckless disregard of 
        the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, 
        coercion. . .or any combination of such means will be used to 
        cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that the 
        person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused 
        to engage in a commercial sex act'';
            (2) while use of the word ``obtains'' in section 1591, 
        United States Code, has been interpreted, prior to the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to encompass those who purchase illicit 
        sexual acts from trafficking victims, some confusion persists;
            (3) in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. 
        2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth 
        Circuit ruled that section 1591 of title 18, United States 
        Code, applied to persons who purchase illicit sexual acts with 
        trafficking victims after the United States District Court for 
        the District of South Dakota erroneously granted motions to 
        acquit these buyers in two separate cases; and
            (4) section 108 of this title amends section 1591 of title 
        18, United States Code, to add the words ``solicits or 
        patronizes'' to the sex trafficking statute making absolutely 
        clear for judges, juries, prosecutors, and law enforcement 
        officials that criminals who purchase sexual acts from human 
        trafficking victims may be arrested, prosecuted, and convicted

    This title may be cited as the ``Human Exploitation Rescue 
Operations Act of 2015'' or the ``HERO Act of 2015''.

SEC. 302. HERO ACT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution 
        of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the 
        United States. International demand for this material creates a 
        powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children 
        within the United States.
            (2) The targeting of United States children by 
        international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland 
        security of the United States. This threat must be fought with 
        trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-
        exploitation strategies and technologies.
            (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical 
        national security role in protecting the United States from the 
        growing international threat of child exploitation and human 
        trafficking.
            (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national 
        resource in the effort to combat international child 
        exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in 
        investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.
            (5) The returning military heroes of the United States 
        possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law 
        enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, 
        and the Department of Homeland Security should use this 
        national resource to the maximum extent possible.
            (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) 
        Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of 
        the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes 
        of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue 
        children from sexual abuse and slavery.
    (b) Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Investigations Unit, 
and Computer Forensics Unit.--
            (1) In general.--Subtitle H of title VIII of the Homeland 
        Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) is amended by
