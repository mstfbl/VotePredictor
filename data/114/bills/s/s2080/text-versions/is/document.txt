        pipeline water crossings;
            (4) identify gaps in data and information that exist in the 
        pipeline network in the Great Lakes Basin, and request 
        information related to pipeline integrity or risks from owners 
        and operators with facilities that cross lakes, rivers, and 
        streams; and
            (5) produce recommendations to prevent future leaks,
