SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 1919 to 1920, the Sixty-Sixth United States 
        Congress debated, and State legislatures considered, an 
        amendment to the United States Constitution to provide suffrage 
        for women.
            (2) A proposed women's suffrage amendment was first 
        introduced in the United States Senate in 1878 and was brought 
        to a vote, unsuccessfully, in 1887, 1914, 1918, and 1919. 
        Finally, on May 21, 1919, the House of Representatives approved 
        a proposed amendment, followed by the Senate a few weeks later 
        on June 4. Within days, the legislatures of Wisconsin, 
        Illinois, and Michigan had voted to ratify the Amendment.
            (3) On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th State to 
        ratify the Amendment, providing the support of three-fourths of 
        States necessary under article V of the United States 
        Constitution.
            (4) The introduction, passage, and ultimate ratification of 
        the Nineteenth Amendment were the culmination of decades of 
        work and struggle by advocates for the rights of women across 
        the United States and worldwide.
            (5) Ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment ensured women 
        could more fully participate in their democracy and 
        fundamentally changed the role of women in the civic life of 
        our Nation.
            (6) The centennial offers an opportunity for people in the 
        United States to learn about and commemorate the efforts of the 
        women's suffrage movement and the role of women in our 
        democracy.
            (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow 
        people in the United States to learn about the women's suffrage 
        movement and to commemorate and honor the role of the 
        ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in further fulfilling 
        the promise of the United States Constitution and promoting the 
        core values of our democracy.
