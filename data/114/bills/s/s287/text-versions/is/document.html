SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the safety of the food supply of the United States is 
        vital to the public health, to public confidence in the food 
        supply, and to the success of the food sector of the Nation's 
        economy;
            (2) lapses in the protection of the food supply and loss of 
        public confidence in food safety are damaging to consumers and 
        the food industry, and place a burden on interstate commerce;
            (3) the safety and security of the food supply requires an 
        integrated, systemwide approach to preventing foodborne 
        illness, a thorough and broad-based approach to basic and 
        applied research, and intensive, effective, and efficient 
        management of the Nation's food safety program;
            (4) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of 
        the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--
                    (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and 
                the ability to detect all forms of contamination;
                    (B) an aging and immune-compromised population, 
                with a growing number of people at high risk for 
                foodborne illnesses, including infants and children;
                    (C) a concern regarding food fraud for economic 
                gain, especially with mislabeling and intentionally 
                misleading claims;
                    (D) an increasing volume of imported food, without 
                adequate monitoring and inspection; and
                    (E) maintenance of rigorous inspection of the 
                domestic food processing and food service industries;
            (5) Federal food safety standard setting, inspection, 
        enforcement, and research efforts should be based on the best 
        available science and public health considerations and food 
        safety resources should be systematically deployed in ways that 
        most effectively prevent foodborne illness;
            (6) the Federal food safety system is fragmented, with at 
        least 15 Federal agencies sharing responsibility for food 
        safety, and operates under laws that do not reflect current 
        conditions in the food system or current scientific knowledge 
        about the cause and prevention of foodborne illness;
            (7) the fragmented Federal food safety system and outdated 
        laws preclude an integrated, systemwide approach to preventing 
        foodborne illness, to the effective and efficient operation of 
        the Nation's food safety program, and to the most beneficial 
        deployment of food safety resources;
            (8) the National Academy of Sciences recommended in the 
        report ``Ensuring Safe Food from Production to Consumption'' 
        that Congress establish by statute a unified and central 
        framework for managing Federal food safety programs, and 
        recommended modifying Federal statutes so that inspection, 
        enforcement, and research efforts are based on scientifically 
        supportable assessments of risks to public health; and
            (9) the lack of a single focal point for food safety 
        leadership in the United States undercuts the ability of the 
        United States to exert food safety leadership internationally, 
        which is detrimental to the public health and the international 
        trade interests of the United States.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to establish a single agency to be known as the ``Food 
        Safety Administration'' to--
                    (A) regulate food safety and related labeling to 
                strengthen the protection of the public health;
                    (B) ensure that food facilities fulfill their 
                responsibility to produce food in a manner that 
                protects the public health of all people in the United 
                States;
                    (C) lead an integrated, systemwide approach to food 
                safety and to make more effective and efficient use of 
                resources to prevent foodborne illness;
                    (D) provide a single focal point for food safety 
                leadership, both nationally and internationally; and
                    (E) provide an integrated food safety research 
                capability, utilizing internally generated, 
                scientifically and statistically valid studies, in 
                cooperation with academic institutions and other 
                scientific entities of the Federal and State 
                governments, to achieve the continuous improvement of 
                research on foodborne illness and contaminants;
            (2) to transfer to the Food Safety Administration the food 
        safety, labeling, inspection, and enforcement functions that, 
        as of the day before the effective date of this Act, are 
        performed by other Federal agencies; and
            (3) to modernize and strengthen the Federal food safety 
        laws to achieve more effective application and efficient 
        management of the laws for the protection and improvement of 
        public health.

SEC. 402. MANDATORY RECALL AUTHORITY.

    (a) Voluntary Procedures.--If the Administrator determines that 
there is a reasonable probability that an article of food (other than 
infant formula) is adulterated or misbranded and the use of or exposure 
to such article will cause serious adverse health consequences or death 
to humans or animals, the Administrator shall provide the owner, 
operator, or agent in charge of the facility that created, caused, or 
was otherwise responsible for such food with an opportunity to cease 
distribution and recall such article.
    (b) Prehearing Order To Cease Distribution and Give Notice.--
            (1) In general.--If the owner, operator, or agent in charge 
        of the facility refuses to or does not voluntarily cease 
        distribution or recall such article within the time and in the 
        manner prescribed by the Administrator (if so prescribed), the 
        Administrator may by order require, as the Administrator deems 
        necessary, such person to--
                    (A) immediately cease distribution of such article;
                    (B) as applicable, immediately notify all persons 
                manufacturing, processing, packing, transporting, 
                distributing, receiving, holding, or importing and

            (2) Required additional information.--
                    (A) In general.--If an article of food covered by a 
                recall order issued under paragraph (1)(B) has been 
                distributed to a warehouse-based, third-party logistics 
                provider without providing such provider sufficient 
                information to know or reasonably determine the precise 
                identity of the article of food covered by a recall 
                order that is in its possession, the notice provided by 
                the responsible party subject to the order issued under 
                paragraph (1)(B) shall include such information as is 
                necessary for the warehouse-based, third-party 
                logistics provider to identify the food.
                    (B) Rules of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed--
                            (i) to exempt a warehouse-based, third-
                        party logistics provider from the requirements 
                        of food safety law; or
                            (ii) to exempt a warehouse-based, third-
                        party logistics provider from being the subject 
                        of a mandatory recall order.
            (3) Determination to limit areas affected.--If the 
        Administrator requires an owner, operator, or agent in charge 
        of the facility to cease distribution under paragraph (1)(A) of 
        an article of food identified in subsection (a), the 
        Administrator may limit the size of the geographic area and the 
        markets affected by such cessation if such limitation would not 
        compromise the public health.
    (c) Hearing on Order.--The Administrator shall provide the owner, 
operator, or agent in charge of the facility subject to an order under 
subsection (b) with an opportunity for an informal hearing, to be held 
as soon as possible, but not later than 2 days after the issuance of 
the order, on the actions required by the order and on why the article 
that is the subject of the order should not be recalled.
    (d) Post-Hearing Recall Order and Modification of Order.--
            (1) Amendment of order.--If, after providing opportunity 
        for an informal hearing under subsection (c), the Administrator 
        determines that removal of the article from commerce is 
        necessary, the Administrator shall, as appropriate--
                    (A) amend the order to require recall of such 
                article or other appropriate action;

                article was, or may have been, distributed.
            (2) Vacating of order.--If, after such hearing, the 
        Administrator determines that adequate grounds do not exist to 
        continue the actions required by the order, or that such 
        actions should be modified, the Administrator shall vacate the 
        order or modify the order.
    (e) Rule Regarding Alcoholic Beverages.--The Administrator shall 
not initiate a mandatory recall or take any other action under this

        in order to provide notification--
                    (A) of the recall to consumers and retailers to 
                whom such article was, or may have been, distributed; 
                and
                    (B) that includes, at a minimum--
                            (i) the name of the article of food subject 
                        to the recall;
                            (ii) a description of the risk associated 
                        with such article; and
                            (iii) to the extent practicable, 
                        information for consumers about similar 
                        articles of food that are not affected by the 
                        recall;
            (2) provide to the public a list of retail consignees 
        receiving products for which there is determined to be a

            (3) if available, publish on the Internet website of the 
        Administration an image of the article that is the subject of 
        the press release described in paragraph (1).
    (h) No Delegation.--The authority conferred by this section to 
order a recall or vacate a recall order shall not be delegated to any 
officer or employee other than the Administrator.
    (i) Effect.--Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of 
the Administrator to request or participate in a voluntary recall, or 
to issue an order to cease distribution or to recall under any other 
provision of the food safety law or under the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).

            (1) In general.--To assist in carrying out the requirements 
        of this subsection, the Administrator shall establish an 
        incident command operation or a similar operation that will 
        operate not later than 24 hours after the initiation of a 
        mandatory recall or the recall of an article of food for which 
        the use of, or exposure to, such article will cause serious 
        adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.
            (2) Requirements.--To reduce the potential for 
        miscommunication during recalls or regarding investigations of 
        a foodborne illness outbreak associated with a food that is 
        subject to a recall, each incident command operation or similar 
        operation under paragraph (1) shall use regular staff and 
        resources of the Administration to--
                    (A) ensure timely and coordinated communication 
                within the Administration, including enhanced 
                communication and coordination between different

                from the Administration, including public statements, 
                throughout the duration of the investigation and 
                related foodborne illness outbreak;
                    (C) identify a single point of contact within the 
                Administration for public inquiries regarding any 
                actions by the Administrator related to a recall;
                    (D) coordinate with Federal, State, local, and 
                tribal authorities, as appropriate, that have 
                responsibilities related to the recall of a food or a 
                foodborne illness outbreak associated with a food that 
                is subject to the recall, including notification of the 
                Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Education 
                in the event such recalled food is a commodity intended 
                for use in a child nutrition program (as defined in 
                section 25(b) of the Richard B. Russell National School 
                Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1769f(b))); and
                    (E) conclude operations at such time as the 
                Administrator determines appropriate.
            (3) Multiple recalls.--The Administrator may establish 
        multiple or concurrent incident command operations or similar

        379j-31) for not complying with a recall order are applicable 
        to all food facilities under this Act as if--
                    (A) the term ``responsible party'' means ``owner, 
                operator, or agent in charge of the facility''; and
                    (B) references to section 423 of the Federal Food, 
                Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350l) are references
