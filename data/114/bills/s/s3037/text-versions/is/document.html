by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(n)(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
this subsection, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a 
system for classifying any individual who is determined to be entitled 
to disability insurance benefits under this title or to monthly 
benefits under section 202 by reason of being under a disability in the 
following manner:
            ``(A) An individual shall be classified as `medical 
        improvement expected' if the impairment or combination of 
        impairments causing the individual to be disabled is expected 
        to medically improve to the point where the individual will no 
        longer be disabled in 12 to 24 months.
            ``(B) An individual shall be classified as `medical 
        improvement likely' if the impairment or combination of 
        impairments causing the individual to be disabled is expected 
        to medically improve to the point where the individual will no 
        longer be disabled in 25 months to 60 months.
            ``(C) An individual shall be classified as `medical 
        improvement possible' if the impairment or combination of 
        impairments causing the individual to be disabled is not 
        expected to medically improve to the point where the individual 
        will no longer be disabled in 60 months, but future improvement 
        is possible.
            ``(D) An individual shall be classified as `medical 
        improvement not expected' if the individual has an impairment 
        or combination of impairments that is chronic or progressive 
        with permanent, irreversible structural or functional loss, and 
        for which there is no known effective therapy, treatment, or 
        surgical intervention that could result in medical improvement 
        to the point where the individual is no longer disabled.
    ``(2) In classifying an individual under the system established 
under this subsection, the Commissioner of Social Security shall not 
classify an individual as `medical improvement not expected' solely by 
reason of such individual's age where a lesser classification is 
appropriate.
    ``(3) Notwithstanding section 205(b)(1) or subsection (c)(1) or (d) 
of this section, there shall be no review of, or right to appeal, a 
classification made under the system established under this 
subsection.''.

              BENEFICIARIES.

    ``(1)(A) In the case of any individual who has not attained age 63, 
is determined to be under a disability, and is classified as `medical 
improvement possible' or `medical improvement not expected', the 
applicable State agency or the Commissioner of Social Security (as may 
be appropriate) shall, for purposes of determining such individual's 
continuing disability--
            ``(i) if the individual is classified as `medical 
        improvement possible', conduct a review to determine whether 
        the individual remains under a disability during the 5th year 
        following the first month after the individual's waiting period 
        (as defined in section 223(c)(2)); and
            ``(ii) if the individual is classified as `medical 
        improvement not expected', conduct a review to determine 
        whether the individual remains under a disability during the 
        10th year following the first month after the individual's 
        waiting period (as so defined).
    ``(B) In addition to the continuing disability reviews required 
under subparagraph (A) and notwithstanding how an individual is 
classified under the system established by the Commissioner of Social 
Security under subsection (n), if the Commissioner has reason to 
believe that an individual that has been determined to be under a 
disability is not under a disability, the Commissioner may review such 
individual's case at such time and in such manner as the Commissioner 
determines appropriate except that the Commissioner shall not initiate 
a review on the basis of income earned by an individual who is a 
participant in the process established under section 223(l).
    ``(C) Reviews of cases which are required or permitted under this 
paragraph shall be in addition to, and shall not be considered as a 
substitute for, any other reviews which are required or provided for 
under or in the administration of this title.'';
            (2) by striking paragraph (2); and
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (5) as

                new paragraph:
            ``(5) in the case of a continuing disability review under 
        section 221(i), evidence that would be sufficient to support a 
        finding in an initial determination that the individual is not 
        under a disability and is able to engage in substantial gainful 
        activity.''; and
                    (C) in the flush matter at the end, by inserting 
                ``, except that, in the case of a continuing disability 
                review under section 221(i), the Commissioner shall not 
                consider the fact that an individual is engaged in 
                substantial gainful work as part of the process 
                established under subsection (l) as evidence that the 
                individual is able to engage in substantial gainful 
                activity'' after ``secured by the Commissioner of 
                Social Security''.

        423(d)(2)) is amended--

                individual'' and inserting ``Subject to subparagraph 
                (D), an individual''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraph:
            ``(D) In the case of a continuing disability review under 
        section 221(i), an individual may be found to be under a 
        disability even though the individual is engaged in substantial 
        gainful work as part of the process established under 
        subsection (l).''.

SEC. 4. REGULATIONS RELATED TO DISABILITY CLASSIFICATIONS AND CDRS.

benefits under section 202 by reason of being under a disability for 
any month that begins on or after the date that is 1 year after the

Return to Work Act of 2016, is determined to be under a disability, and 
is classified by the Commissioner of Social Security as `medical 
improvement expected' or `medical improvement likely', the termination 
month applicable to the individual shall be--
            ``(A) if the individual has been classified as `medical 
        improvement expected', the 23rd month following the first month 
        after the individual's waiting period (as defined in subsection 
        (c)(2)); or

        of the termination month applicable (or most recently 
        applicable) to the individual under paragraph (1) as of the 
        date of such application and ending with the date that is 12 
        months before the end of such termination month.

Security may deem an application for disability insurance benefits 
under this section or for monthly benefits under section 202 by reason 
of being under a disability submitted by an individual who is a 
recipient of such benefits that is submitted after the period described 
in clause (i)(II) to be a timely reapplication if--

        application was not submitted during such period; and
            ``(II) the application is submitted not later than 6 months

adverse determination with respect to the timely reapplication of an 
individual who is a recipient of disability insurance benefits under 
this section or monthly benefits under section 202 by reason of being 
under a disability and such individual files a timely request for a 
hearing under section 221(d), such individual may elect to have the 
payment of such benefits (as well as any other benefits payable under 
this title or title XVIII on the basis of such individual's entitlement 
to such benefits) continue in the same manner and subject to the same 
conditions as an election made under subsection (g).

this section or monthly benefits under section 202 by reason of being 
under a disability--

        be under a disability shall have no evidentiary weight;

        process established under subsection (l) may be taken into 
        account for purposes of determining whether such individual is 
        under a disability; and

            ``(i) in the case of an individual who has average monthly 
        earnings (as determined under subparagraph (B)) equal to or 
        less than the level of monthly earnings established by the

return to employment under this subsection, any services performed or 
earnings derived from services during the period of such participation
