labor organizations representing a class or craft of directly affected 
employees of railroads carriers or railroad carrier contractors) in a 
confidential close call reporting system.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Program Elements.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Secretary shall use any 
        information and experience gathered through research and pilot 
        programs on confidential close call reporting systems in 
        developing a rule for the voluntary adoption of confidential 
        close call reporting system programs under this 
        section.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Rulemaking.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--Each confidential close 
                call reporting system program shall be designed to 
                improve railroad safety by facilitating greater 
                collection and analysis of reports that describe unsafe 
                conditions and events in the railroad industry, as 
                reported voluntarily and confidentially by 
                employees.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Requirements.--The rule shall 
                specify--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        railroad safety regulatory provisions and the 
                        conditions under which the relief will and will 
                        not be granted; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (vi) the appropriate use and 
                        protection, including the information 
                        protections described in subsection (d), of 
                        confidential data generated under voluntary 
                        participation in the confidential close call 
                        reporting system.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Program Development.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--A railroad carrier voluntarily 
        participating in a confidential close call reporting system

                railroad carrier contractor or the representative 
                thereof; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) the participating employees and 
                contractors or the representative thereof (such as 1 or 
                more non-profit labor organizations representing a 
                class or craft of directly affected employees of the 
                railroad carrier or railroad carrier 
                contractor).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Information Protection.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--For a confidential close call 
        reporting system program established through an implementing 
        memorandum of understanding described in subsection (c), the 
        rule shall include provisions that withhold from discovery or 
        admission into evidence (in a Federal or State court proceeding 
        for damages involving personal injury, wrongful death, or 
        property damage against a railroad carrier or railroad carrier 
        contractor) any plan, document, report, survey, schedule, list, 
        or data compiled or collected for the sole purpose of 
        developing, evaluating, planning, or implementing a 
        confidential close call reporting system program, including a 
        railroad carrier's analysis of its close calls or near 
        misses.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Retroactive applications.--With regard to a 
        voluntary confidential close call reporting system that was in 
        effect prior to the date of final rule under subsection (a), 
        the Secretary--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) shall allow the parties participating 
                in that system to sign a new or revised implementing 
                memorandum of understanding that prospectively entitles 
                the parties to the information protections under 
                paragraph (1); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) may retroactively apply the 
                information protections under paragraph (1) to any 
                information and analyses that was generated under that 
                system prior to the date of the final rule.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Confidentiality.--For a confidential close 
        call reporting system program established through an 
        implementing memorandum of understanding described in 
        subsection (c), the Secretary shall ensure that the Department 
        of Transportation and any entity collecting close call reports, 
        de-identifying data, or distributing close call data provide 
        the same level of confidentiality as contained in the 
        Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency 
        Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. 3501 note), as administered by the 
        Bureau of Transportation Statistics.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) require a railroad carrier to adopt a 
        confidential close call reporting system program;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) prohibit a railroad carrier from voluntarily 
        adopting a confidential close call reporting system program 
        outside of the rulemaking framework; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) require the Secretary to develop a 
        confidential close call reporting system program with a 
        railroad carrier, a railroad carrier contractor, employees of 
        the railroad carrier or railroad carrier contractor, or any 
        non-profit labor organizations representing a class or craft of 
        employees of a railroad carrier or a railroad carrier 
        contractor.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Definition of Railroad Carrier.--In this section, the 
term ``railroad carrier'' has the meaning given the term in section 
20102 of title 49, United States Code.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (g) Additional Information Protections.--Section 20118 is 
amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in subsection (a)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in the matter preceding paragraph 
                (1)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) by inserting ``, confidential 
                        close call reporting system program,'' after 
                        ``safety risk reduction program''; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                confidential close call reporting system program,'' 
                after ``safety risk reduction program'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in subsection (b), by inserting ``, 
        confidential close call reporting system program,'' after 
        ``safety risk reduction program''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) in subsection (c), by inserting ``, of any 
        information or analyses generated as part of a confidential 
        close call reporting system program,'' after ``risk mitigation 
        analyses''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 403. SPEED LIMIT ACTION PLANS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, each railroad carrier providing intercity rail 
passenger transportation or commuter rail passenger transportation, in 
consultation with any applicable host railroad carrier, shall survey 
its entire system and identify each main track location where there is 
a reduction of more than 20 miles per hour from the approach speed to a 
curve or bridge and the maximum authorized operating speed for 
passenger trains at that curve or bridge.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Action Plans.--Not later than 120 days after the date 
that the survey under subsection (a) is complete, a rail passenger 
carrier shall submit to the Secretary an action plan that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) identifies each main track location where 
        there is a reduction of more than 20 miles per hour from the 
        approach speed to a curve or bridge and the maximum authorized 
        operating speed for passenger trains at that curve or 
        bridge;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) describes appropriate actions, including 
        modification to automatic train control systems, if applicable, 
        other signal systems, or other practices, including increased 
        crew communication, to enable warning and enforcement of the 
        maximum authorized speed for passenger trains at each location 
        identified under paragraph (1);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) contains milestones and target dates for 
        implementing each appropriate action described under paragraph 
        (2); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) ensures compliance with the maximum authorized 
        speed at each location identified under paragraph 
        (1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Approval.--Not later than 90 days after the date an 
action plan is submitted under subsection (a), the Secretary shall 
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove the action 
plan.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

from the requirements of this section each segment of track for which 
operations are governed by a positive train control system certified 
under section 20157 of title 49, United States Code, or any other 
safety technology or practice that would achieve an equivalent or 
greater level of safety in reducing derailment risk.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall 
prohibit the Secretary from applying the requirements of this section 
to other segments of track at high risk of overspeed 
derailment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 404. SIGNAGE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall promulgate such 
regulations as the Secretary considers necessary to require each 
railroad carrier providing intercity rail passenger transportation or 
commuter rail passenger transportation, in consultation with any 
applicable host railroad carrier, to install signs to warn train crews 
before the train approaches a location that the Secretary identifies as 
having high risk of overspeed derailment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Alternative Safety Measures.--The Secretary may exempt 
from the requirements of this section each segment of track for which 
operations are governed by a positive train control system certified 
under section 20157 of title 49, United States Code, or any other 
safety technology or practice that would achieve an equivalent or 
greater level of safety in reducing derailment risk.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 405. ALERTERS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall promulgate a rule to 
require a working alerter in the controlling locomotive of each 
passenger train in intercity rail passenger transportation (as defined 
in section 24102 of title 49, United States Code) or commuter rail 
passenger transportation (as defined in section 24102 of title 49, 
United States Code).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Rulemaking.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Secretary may promulgate a 
        rule to specify the essential functionalities of a working 
        alerter, including the manner in which the alerter can be 
        reset.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Alternate practice or technology.--The 
        Secretary may require or allow a technology or practice in lieu 
        of a working alerter if the Secretary determines that the 
        technology or practice would achieve an equivalent or greater 
        level of safety in enhancing or ensuring appropriate locomotive 
        control.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 406. SIGNAL PROTECTION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall promulgate such 
regulations as the Secretary considers necessary to require that on-
track safety regulations, whenever practicable and consistent with 
other safety requirements and operational considerations, include 
requiring implementation of redundant signal protection, such as 
shunting or other practices and technologies that achieve an equivalent 
or greater level of safety, for maintenance-of-way work crews who 
depend on a train dispatcher to provide signal protection.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Alternative Safety Measures.--The Secretary may exempt 
from the requirements of this section each segment of track for which 
operations are governed by a positive train control system certified 
under section 20157 of title 49, United States Code, or any other 
safety technology or practice that would achieve an equivalent or 
greater level of safety in providing additional signal 
protection.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 407. TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION PLANS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 20156(e) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in paragraph (4)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking 
                ``and'' at the end; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the 
                period at the end and inserting ``; and''; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) each railroad carrier required to 
                submit such a plan, until the implementation of a 
                positive train control system by the railroad carrier, 
                shall analyze and, as appropriate, prioritize 
                technologies and practices to mitigate the risk of 
                overspeed derailments.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 408. COMMUTER RAIL TRACK INSPECTIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall evaluate track 
inspection regulations to determine if a railroad carrier providing 
commuter rail passenger transportation on high density commuter 
railroad lines should be required to inspect the lines in the same 
manner as currently required for other commuter railroad 
lines.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Rulemaking.--Considering safety, including railroad 
carrier employee and contractor safety, and system capacity, the 
Secretary may promulgate a rule for high density commuter railroad 
lines. If, after the evaluation under subsection (a), the Secretary 
determines that it is necessary to promulgate a rule, the Secretary 
shall specifically consider the following regulatory requirements for 
high density commuter railroad lines:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
