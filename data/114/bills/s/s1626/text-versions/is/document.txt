Corridor Commission established under section 24905, the State-
Supported Route Committee established under section 24712, and groups 
representing rail passengers and customers, as appropriate, shall 
complete a study that evaluates--
            (1) the shared use of right-of-way by passenger and freight 
        rail systems; and
            (2) the operational, institutional, and legal structures 
        that would best support improvements to the systems referred to 
        in paragraph (1).
    (b) Areas of Study.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall evaluate--
            (1) the access and use of railroad right-of-way by a rail 
        carrier that does not own the right-of-way, such as passenger 
        rail services that operate over privately-owned right-of-way, 
        including an analysis of--
                    (A) access agreements;
                    (B) costs of access; and

        and regulatory mechanisms for establishing, measuring, and 
        enforcing train performance standards, including--

                recorded;
                    (B) the assignment of responsibility for such 
                delays; and
                    (C) the use of incentives and penalties for 
                performance;
            (3) strengths and weaknesses in the existing mechanisms 
        described in paragraph (2) and possible approaches to address 
        the weaknesses;
            (4) mechanisms for measuring and maintaining public 
        benefits resulting from publicly funded freight or passenger 
        rail improvements, including improvements directed towards 
        shared-use right-of-way by passenger and freight rail;
            (5) approaches to operations, capacity, and cost estimation 
        modeling that--
                    (A) allows for transparent decisionmaking; and

                    (C) whether current insurance levels of passenger 
                rail operators are adequate and whether to establish 
                minimum insurance requirements for such passenger rail 
                operators; and
                    (D) whether to establish a liability regime modeled 
                after section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
                U.S.C. 2210);
            (7) the effect on rail passenger services, operations, 
        liability limits and insurance levels of the assertion of 
        sovereign immunity by a State; and

                    (B) consider and recommend technology, process, 
                policy, or other options that would permit through-
                ticketing to allow intercity and commuter rail 
                passengers to purchase, in a single transaction, travel 
                that utilizes Amtrak and connecting commuter rail 
                services;
