                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a task force to review policies and measures to promote, 
  and to develop best practices for, reduction of short-lived climate 
                  pollutants, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Super Pollutants Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) short-lived climate pollutants account for 40 percent 
        of global warming impacting the atmosphere, even though those 
        pollutants account for a much smaller percentage of warming 
        agents, by weight;
            (2) reducing short-lived climate pollutant emissions 
        could--
                    (A) prevent more than 2,000,000 premature deaths 
                each year, according to the United Nations Environment 
                Programme (UNEP);
                    (B) prevent more than 30,000,000 tons of crop 
                losses each year, according to UNEP;
                    (C) cut the rate of sea-level rise by 25 percent, 
                according to the National Center for Atmospheric 
                Research and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography;
                    (D) cut the rate of warming by up to 0.6 degrees 
                Celsius by 2050, according to UNEP; and
                    (E) significantly contribute toward the overall 
                global target of holding increased warming below 2 
                degrees Celsius;
            (3) the United States is--
                    (A) 1 of the largest consumers of 
                hydrofluorocarbons in the world; and
                    (B) providing significant innovation in the 
                development of low global warming potential (low-GWP) 
                alternatives;
            (4) the United States could serve as a leader and exemplar 
        of responsibly phasing down hydrofluorocarbon production and 
        consumption;
            (5)(A) the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
        Ozone Layer has been an extraordinarily successful model for 
        protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and achieving 
        significant climate protection cobenefits; and
            (B) since that treaty was signed in 1987, there has been a 
        98-percent reduction in ozone-depleting substances; and
            (6) the interagency Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, 
        released in March 2014, outlines a proactive agenda for 
        reducing methane leakage and waste throughout the United States 
        economy.

        Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of 
        the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Commandant of the 
        Coast Guard, shall develop a comprehensive plan to reduce black 
        carbon emissions, based on appropriate emission data from 
        oceangoing vessels provided on a voluntary basis, from 
        international shipping through--
                    (A) a clean freight partnership;
                    (B) the inclusion of limits on black carbon; and
                    (C) efforts that include protection of access to 
                critical fuel shipments and emergency needs of coastal 
                communities.
            (2) Roadmap.--A principal objective of the plan developed 
        pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be the establishment, in 
        coordination with the Department of Transportation, of a 
        roadmap toward helping countries reduce fine-particle emissions 
        (PM&lt;INF&gt;2.5&lt;/INF&gt;) in the shipping sector through--
                    (A) the installation of advanced emissions 
                controls; and
                    (B) the reduction of sulfur content in fuels.

United States in the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-
Lived Climate Pollutants, the Secretary of State is encouraged--
            (1) to work with the Coalition to craft specific financing 
        mechanisms for the incremental cost of international black 
        carbon mitigation activities; and

                substantial environmental, gender, livelihood, and 
                public health benefits, including support for clean-
                burning cookstoves and fuels; and
                    (C) work with the Global Alliance for Clean 
                Cookstoves to help developing nations establish 
                thriving markets for clean and efficient cooking 
                solutions.
            (2) Emissions reductions.--The Secretary of State, in 
        collaboration with the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency and the Secretary of Transportation, shall 
        provide additional aid to international efforts to reduce black 
        carbon emissions from diesel trucks, 2-stroke engines, diesel 
        generators, and industrial processes by providing technical 
        assistance--
                    (A) to help developing nations lower the sulfur 
                content of diesel fuels;
                    (B) to expand access to diesel particulate filters;
                    (C) to provide vehicle manufacturers with low-
                emission engine designs; and

                            (ii) to expand initiatives relating to the 
                        recovery and reclamation of hydrofluorocarbons;
                    (B) cooperate with the Secretary of Energy in 
                considering modifications to the Energy Star program 
                established under section 324A of the Energy Policy and 
                Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6294a) to include 
                refrigerant systems that--
                            (i) achieve best-in-class energy efficiency

        United States leadership and full support of an amendment to 
        the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
        Layer, done at Montreal September 16, 1987, should ensure a 
        smooth, technically feasible global transition away from high-
        GWP HFC.
    (b) Study on High-GWP HFC Alternatives.--Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and

                    (A) identifies--
                            (i) the standards or regulatory barriers 
                        that are preventing the use of alternatives to 
                        high-GWP HFC in the United States that are in 
                        widespread use in other countries;
                            (ii) any standards or regulations requiring 
                        revision; and

                (1); and
                    (B) to reduce the allocation of HCFC-22 consumption 
                allowances commensurate with anticipated decreased 
                demand resulting from the prohibition of uncharged 
                condensing equipment under subsection (e) of section 
                605 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7671d) (as added by 
                paragraph (1)).
    (d) R-134a Automotive Air Conditioning Recharge Kits.--
            (1) Study.--The Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency shall conduct a study to determine the most

    (c) Sense of Congress Regarding Financing Conditions.--It is the 
sense of Congress that, in evaluating gas and oil-related projects for 
financial support, the heads of the United States Export-Import Bank 
and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should condition 
financing for those projects on--
            (1) the deployment of the best technology, methods, and 
        management practices for detecting and repairing leaks of 
        methane throughout the oil and gas production, processing, 
        transportation, and distribution system;
            (2) the minimization of venting and inefficient or 
        unnecessary flaring; and
            (3) the deployment of best technology, methods, and 
        management practices for reducing emissions of other air 
        pollution, especially--
                    (A) volatile organic compounds; and
