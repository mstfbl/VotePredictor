      To protect Federal, State, and local public safety officers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Our Heroes Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Law enforcement officers, first responders, and public 
        safety officials risk their lives every day to serve and 
        protect our neighborhoods and communities.
            (2) These men and women are true public servants who 
        regularly sacrifice and encounter grave daily harm.
            (3) The families of law enforcement officers, first 
        responders, and public safety officials also sacrifice and 
        contribute to their roles as guardians of the public good.
            (4) In recent times, it has become apparent that these 
        women and men are being targeted intentionally by criminals in 
        our society.
            (5) Congress must do all it can to promote a system of law 
        and order which enables law enforcement officers, first 
        responders, and public safety officials to properly do their 
        jobs.
