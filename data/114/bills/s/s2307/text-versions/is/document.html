                                 A BILL


 
   To promote the strengthening of the private sector in Bosnia and 
                              Herzegovina.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bosnia and Herzegovina-American 
Enterprise Fund Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to support economic 
opportunity and political progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina through 
the creation of an enterprise fund that will provide financial 
investment and technical assistance to small and medium-sized 
enterprises.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has a strong interest in ensuring the 
        gains in stability and reconciliation made since the end of the 
        Bosnian War in 1995 are not overtaken by difficult economic 
        conditions.
            (2) In 2014, protests broke out across Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina as a result of widespread frustration among the 
        populace regarding the economy, which is currently experiencing 
        an unemployment rate of more than 40 percent.
            (3)(A) A crucial element for economic progress in Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina is robust growth among small and medium-sized 
        enterprises (SMEs), which have struggled to access necessary 
        financing.
            (B) Although the private sector credit-to-GDP ratio in 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina grew from 25 percent in 2001 to over 65 
        percent in 2008, it has failed to grow in the 7 years since, 
        and is significantly less than the average for advanced 
        economies.
            (C) Bank lending, which grew similarly rapidly before 2008, 
        has grown barely more than 1 percent per year since then.
            (D) International financial institutions and foreign-owned 
        private investment funds active in Bosnia and Herzegovina have 
        provided growth finance for larger companies and infrastructure 
        project financing, but have not substantially invested in SMEs.
            (4)(A) Bosnia and Herzegovina's demographic, income and 
        geographic characteristics are promising for SME growth.
            (B) Bosnia and Herzegovina is a market of almost 4,000,000 
        people, whose per capita income has grown by almost 50 percent 
        in less than a decade, and substantial growth remains in order 
        to achieve income parity with its Balkan neighbor economies.
            (C) Bosnia and Herzegovina currently imports almost 
        $10,000,000,000 of goods per year, a substantial portion of 
        which could be substituted for by domestic SME production.
            (5) To help foster and support the fledgling private sector 
        in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin 
        Wall, Congress, through enactment of the Support for East 
        European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5401 et seq.) 
        and the FREEDOM Support Act (22 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.), 
        authorized nearly $1,200,000,000 for the United States Agency 
        for International Development (USAID) to establish 10 new 
        investment funds (collectively known as the ``Enterprise 
        Funds'') to both support economic development objectives and 
        realize substantial financial returns.
            (6) The Enterprise Funds--
                    (A) channeled approximately $10,000,000,000 of 
                public and private funding into more than 500 
                enterprises in 19 countries;
                    (B) leveraged $6,900,000,000 in private investment 
                capital from outside the United States Government;
                    (C) provided substantial development capital where 
                supply was limited;
                    (D) created or sustained more than 300,000 jobs 
                through investment and development activities;
                    (E) funded $80,000,000 in technical assistance to 
                strengthen the private sector; and
                    (F) are expected to recoup 177 percent of the 
                original USAID funding.
            (7) Enterprise funds established in partnership with United 
        States partners, such as Poland, Hungary, Albania, Russia, and 
        other European countries, have proven beneficial to the 
        economies of such countries.
            (8) Creating a similar fund in close partnership with the 
        people of Bosnia and Herzegovina would help sustain and expand 
        economic reform efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and empower 
        entrepreneurs to create urgently needed employment 
        opportunities.
            (9) Establishing an enterprise fund for Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina would--
                    (A) help improve financial institutions within the 
                country;
                    (B) provide debt, equity, and other investment 
                vehicles for commercially viable SMEs; and
                    (C) make the investment environment more attractive 
                to domestic and international investors.

        and Herzegovina;
            (2) to promote policies and practices conducive to
