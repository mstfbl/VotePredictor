                     Subtitle E--Vehicle Innovation

SEC. 2041. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Energy Information Administration, the 
        transportation sector accounts for approximately 28 percent of 
        the United States primary energy demand and greenhouse gas 
        emissions, and 21 percent of global oil demand.
            (2) The United States transportation sector is over 90-
        percent dependent on petroleum.
            (3) United States heavy truck fuel consumption will 
        increase 27 percent by 2030.
            (4) The domestic automotive and commercial vehicle 
        manufacturing sectors have increasingly limited resources for 
        research, development, and engineering of advanced 
        technologies.
            (5) Vehicle, engine, and component manufacturers are 
        playing a more important role in vehicle technology 
        development, and should be better integrated into Federal 
        research efforts.
            (6) Priorities for the vehicle technologies research of the 
        Department have shifted drastically in recent years among 
        diesel hybrids, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and plug-in 
        electric hybrids, with little continuity among them.
            (7) The integration of vehicle, communication, and 
        infrastructure technologies has great potential for efficiency 
        gains through better management of the total transportation 
        system.
            (8) The Federal Government should balance its role in 
        researching longer-term exploratory concepts and developing 
        nearer-term transformational technologies for vehicles.

SEC. 2042. OBJECTIVES.

    The objectives of this subtitle are--
            (1) to develop United States technologies and practices 
        that--
                    (A) improve the fuel efficiency and emissions of 
                all vehicles produced in the United States; and
                    (B) reduce vehicle reliance on petroleum-based 
                fuels;
            (2) to support domestic research, development, engineering, 
        demonstration, and commercial application and manufacturing of 
        advanced vehicles, engines, and components;
            (3) to enable vehicles to move larger volumes of goods and 
        more passengers with less energy and emissions;
            (4) to develop cost-effective advanced technologies for 
        wide-scale utilization throughout the passenger, commercial, 
        government, and transit vehicle sectors;
            (5) to allow for greater consumer choice of vehicle 
        technologies and fuels;
            (6) shorten technology development and integration cycles 
        in the vehicle industry;
            (7) to ensure a proper balance and diversity of Federal 
        investment in vehicle technologies; and
            (8) to strengthen partnerships between Federal and State 
        governmental agencies and the private and academic sectors.

  Subtitle D--Weatherization Enhancement and Local Energy Efficiency 
                     Investment and Accountability

SEC. 3031. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the State energy program established under part D of 
        title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
        6321 et seq.) (referred to in this section as ``SEP'') and the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons 
        established under part A of title IV of the Energy Conservation 
        and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.) (referred to in 
        this section as ``WAP'') have proven to be beneficial, long-
        term partnerships among Federal, State, and local partners;
            (2) the SEP and the WAP have been reauthorized on a 
        bipartisan basis over many years to address changing national, 
        regional, and State circumstances and needs, especially 
        through--
                    (A) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
                U.S.C. 6201 et seq.);
                    (B) the Energy Conservation and Production Act (42 
                U.S.C. 6801 et seq.);
                    (C) the State Energy Efficiency Programs 
                Improvement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-440; 104 Stat. 
                1006);
                    (D) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13201 
                et seq.);
                    (E) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 
                et seq.); and
                    (F) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 
                2007 (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.);
            (3) the SEP, also known as the ``State energy conservation 
        program''--
                    (A) was first created in 1975 to implement a State-
                based, national program in support of energy 
                efficiency, renewable energy, economic development, 
                energy emergency preparedness, and energy policy; and
                    (B) has come to operate in every sector of the 
                economy in support of the private sector to improve 
                productivity and has dramatically reduced the cost of 
                government through energy savings at the State and 
                local levels;
            (4) Federal laboratory studies have concluded that, for 
        every Federal dollar invested through the SEP, more than $7 is 
        saved in energy costs and almost $11 in non-Federal funds is 
        leveraged;
            (5) the WAP--
                    (A) was first created in 1976 to assist low-income 
                families in response to the first oil embargo;
                    (B) has become the largest residential energy 
                conservation program in the United States, with more 
                than 7,100,000 homes weatherized since the WAP was 
                created;
                    (C) saves an estimated 35 percent of consumption in 
                the typical weatherized home, yielding average annual 
                savings of $437 per year in home energy costs;
                    (D) has created thousands of jobs in both the 
                construction sector and in the supply chain of 
                materials suppliers, vendors, and manufacturers who 
                supply the WAP;
                    (E) returns $2.51 in energy savings for every 
                Federal dollar spent in energy and nonenergy benefits 
                over the life of weatherized homes;
                    (F) serves as a foundation for residential energy 
                efficiency retrofit standards, technical skills, and 
                workforce training for the emerging broader market and 
                reduces residential and power plant emissions of carbon 
                dioxide by 2.65 metric tons each year per home; and
                    (G) has decreased national energy consumption by 
                the equivalent of 24,100,000 barrels of oil annually;
            (6) the WAP can be enhanced with the addition of a targeted 
        portion of the Federal funds through an innovative program that 
        supports projects performed by qualified nonprofit 
        organizations that have a demonstrated capacity to build, 
        renovate, repair, or improve the energy efficiency of a 
        significant number of low-income homes, building on the success 
        of the existing program without replacing the existing WAP 
        network or creating a separate delivery mechanism for basic WAP 
        services;
            (7) the WAP has increased energy efficiency opportunities 
        by promoting new, competitive public-private sector models of 
        retrofitting low-income homes through new Federal partnerships;
            (8) improved monitoring and reporting of the work product 
        of the WAP has yielded benefits, and expanding independent 
        verification of efficiency work will support the long-term 
        goals of the WAP;
            (9) reports of the Government Accountability Office in 
        2011, the Inspector General of the Department, and State 
        auditors have identified State-level deficiencies in monitoring 
        efforts that can be addressed in a manner that will ensure that 
        WAP funds are used more effectively;
            (10) through the history of the WAP, the WAP has evolved 
        with improvements in efficiency technology, including, in the 
        1990s, many States adopting advanced home energy audits, which 
        has led to great returns on investment; and
            (11) as the home energy efficiency industry has become more 
        performance-based, the WAP should continue to use those 
        advances in technology and the professional workforce.

        Subtitle E--Utility Energy Service Contracts Improvement

SEC. 3041. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal Government is the largest consumer of 
        energy in the United States;
            (2) Federal agencies are expected to meet, by law, 
        Executive order, and mandate, stringent energy efficiency and 
        conservation targets;
            (3) the utility energy service contract (referred to in 
        this section as ``UESC'') was developed to provide Federal 
        agencies an effective means to implement energy efficiency, 
        renewable energy and water efficiency projects, and has been 
        used successfully to invest nearly $2,700,000,000 in property 
        at Federal facilities;
            (4) the General Services Administration, which manages more 
        than 9,600 Federal properties and is the lead agency for 
        procuring utility services for the Federal Government, has 
        determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period under 
        the law;
            (5) the Federal Energy Management Program, which oversees 
        the UESC program and is a principal office guiding agencies to 
        use funding more effectively in meeting Federal and agency-
        specific energy and resource management objectives, has 
        determined that UESCs may extend beyond a 10-year period under 
        the law;
            (6) extensive precedent exists for Federal agencies to 
        contract for energy saving services using contracts with term 
        limits of more than 10 years but not to exceed 25 years;
            (7) a number of Federal agencies, contrary to congressional 
        intent, have sought to limit UESC term limits to periods of 
        less than 10 years; and
            (8) greater flexibility with UESCs will help reduce the 
        operational cost of Federal agencies, ultimately saving money 
        for taxpayers.

SEC. 3042. UTILITY ENERGY SERVICE CONTRACTS.

    Part 3 of title V of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act 
(as amended by section 2151) is amended by adding after section 554 the 
following:

``SEC. 555. UTILITY ENERGY SERVICE CONTRACTS.

    ``(a) In General.--Each Federal agency may use, to the maximum 
extent practicable, measures provided by law to meet energy efficiency 
and conservation mandates and laws, including through utility energy 
service contracts.
    ``(b) Contract Period.--The term of a utility energy service 
contract entered into by a Federal agency may have a contract period 
that extends beyond 10 years, but not to exceed 25 years.
    ``(c) Requirements.--The conditions of a utility energy service 
contract entered into by a Federal agency shall include requirements 
for measurement, verification, and performance assurances or guarantees 
of the savings.''.

        sale or use of the electricity occurs. If any amount as 
        increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 0.1 
        cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 
        0.1 cent.

        than April 1 of each calendar year, determine and publish in 
        the Federal Register the inflation adjustment factor for such 
        calendar year in accordance with this subsection.
