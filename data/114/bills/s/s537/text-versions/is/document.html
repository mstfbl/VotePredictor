    (b) Special Rules and Termination of Base Amount Calculation.--
            (1) In general.--Subsection (c) of section 41 is amended to 
        read as follows:
    ``(c) Special Rule in Case of No Qualified Research Expenses in Any 
of 3 Preceding Taxable Years.--
            ``(1) Taxpayers to which subsection applies.--The credit 
        under this section shall be determined under this subsection, 
        and not under subsection (a), if, in any one of the 3 taxable 
        years preceding the taxable year for which the credit is being 
        determined, the taxpayer has no qualified research expenses.
            ``(2) Credit rate.--The credit determined under this

                expired for any taxable year in the 3-taxable-year 
                period taken into account under subsection (a), the 
                qualified research expenses taken into account for such 
                year shall be determined on a basis consistent with the 
                determination of qualified research expenses for the 
                credit year.
                    ``(B) Prevention of distortions.--The Secretary may 
                prescribe regulations to prevent distortions in 
                calculating a taxpayer's qualified research expenses 
                caused by a change in accounting methods used by such 
                taxpayer between the credit year and a year in such 3-
                taxable-year period.''.
