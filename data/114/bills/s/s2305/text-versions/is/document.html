                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           November 19, 2015

Mr. Bennet (for himself and Mr. Portman) introduced the following bill; 
     which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Finance

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the issuance 
     of exempt facility bonds for qualified carbon dioxide capture 
                              facilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Capture Improvement Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide from 
        coal, natural gas, and biomass-fired power plants, as well as 
        from industrial sectors such as oil refining and production of 
        fertilizer, cement, and ethanol, can help protect the 
        environment while improving the economy and national security 
        of the United States.
            (2) The United States is a world leader in the field of 
        carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage, as well as the 
        beneficial use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery 
        operations, with many manufacturers and licensors of carbon 
        dioxide capture technology based in the United States.
            (3) While the prospects for large-scale carbon capture in 
        the United States are promising, costs remain relatively high. 
        Lowering the financing costs for carbon dioxide capture 
        projects would accelerate the deployment of this technology, 
        and if the captured carbon dioxide is subsequently sold for 
        industrial use, such as for use in enhanced oil recovery 
        operations, the economic prospects are further improved.
            (4) Since 1968, tax-exempt private activity bonds have been 
        used to provide access to lower-cost financing for private 
        businesses that are purchasing new capital equipment for 
        certain specified environmental facilities, including 
        facilities that reduce, recycle, or dispose of waste, 
        pollutants, and hazardous substances.
            (5) Allowing tax-exempt financing for the purchase of 
        capital equipment that is used to capture carbon dioxide will 
        reduce the costs of developing carbon dioxide capture projects, 
        accelerate their deployment, and, in conjunction with carbon 
        dioxide utilization and long-term storage, help the United 
        States meet critical environmental, economic, and national 
        security goals.

SEC. 3. CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES.

    (a) In General.--Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
