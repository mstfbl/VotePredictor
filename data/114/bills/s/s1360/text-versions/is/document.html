    ``(4) Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this 
paragraph, the Secretary--
            ``(A) shall consider whether additional adjustments are 
        needed to the liability cap under paragraph (2);
            ``(B) shall consider whether to establish or adjust

        accident or incident'' and inserting ``$500,000,000 per

        responsibility is necessary or sufficient to satisfy claims 
        under this section.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall be 
effective for any passenger rail accident or incident occurring on or 
after May 12, 2015.

        grant to an entity described in section 28103(e)(1)(A) of title 
        49, United States Code, to provide a reasonable reimbursement 
        to offset any incremental increase in the cost of insurance, if 
        the Secretary determines that the additional cost of insurance 
        is a result of the amendments to that section made by section 1 
        of this Act.
            (2) Determinations.--In determining the amount of a 
        reimbursement under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider

appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out subsection (a).
