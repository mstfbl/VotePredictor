and the exchange of electronic health information.
    (b) Areas of Concentration.--In conducting the study under 
subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall--
            (1) evaluate current methods used in certified electronic

                    (A) the privacy of patient information;
                    (B) the security of patient information;
                    (C) improving matching rates;
                    (D) reducing matching errors; and
                    (E) reducing duplicate records; and
            (2) determine whether the Office of the National 
        Coordinator for Health Information Technology could improve 
        patient matching by taking steps including--
                    (A) defining additional data elements to assist in 
                patient data matching;
                    (B) agreeing on a required minimum set of elements 
                that need to be collected and exchanged;
                    (C) requiring electronic health records to have the 
                ability to make certain fields required and use 
                specific standards; or
                    (D) other options recommended by the relevant 
                stakeholders consulted pursuant to subsection (a).
    (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the appropriate
