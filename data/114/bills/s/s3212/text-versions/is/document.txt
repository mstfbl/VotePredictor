SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has a long history of farming and has 
        historically appreciated the invaluable contribution of farming 
        to domestic and global populations;
            (2) family farms represent 97 percent of all farms in the 
        United States, of which 90 percent are small family farms;
            (3) over 30 States have established Century or Centennial 
        Farm designations and awards; and
            (4) agricultural producers perform a vital public service 
        that should be recognized and rewarded.

SEC. 3. CENTURY FARMS PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this 
section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a program under which the 
Secretary recognizes any farm that--
            (1) a State department of agriculture or similar statewide 
        agricultural organization recognizes as a Century Farm; or
            (2)(A) is defined as a farm or ranch under section 4284.902 
        of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the 
        date of enactment of this Act);
            (B) has been in continuous operation for at least 100 
        years; and
            (C) has been owned by the same family for at least 100 
        consecutive years, as verified through deeds, wills, abstracts, 
        tax statements, or other similar legal documents considered 
        appropriate by the Secretary.
    (b) Preference.--In recognizing farms under this section, the 
Secretary shall give preference to small farms, as determined by the 
Secretary.
