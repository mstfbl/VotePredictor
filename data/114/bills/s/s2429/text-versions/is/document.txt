   To require a report on the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear

SEC. 2. REPORT ON MILITARY DIMENSIONS OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM; 
              LIMITATIONS ON SANCTIONS RELIEF.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence, in 
coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to the
