    Congress finds that--
            (1) on August 5, 2015, approximately 3,000,000 gallons of 
        contaminated water was discharged from the Gold King Mine north 
        of Silverton, Colorado, into Cement Creek, a tributary of the 
        Animas River, while contractors of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency were conducting an investigation of the mine--
                    (A) to assess the ongoing water releases from the 
                mine;
                    (B) to treat mine water; and
                    (C) to assess the feasibility of further mine 
                remediation;
            (2) the plume of contaminated water resulting from the 
        discharge described in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) was found to contain high levels of heavy 
                metals, including aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt,

SEC. 5. LONG-TERM WATER QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAM; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Gold King Mine Spill Response Program.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall work with affected 
        States and Indian tribes to develop, fund, and implement a 
        long-term monitoring program for water quality of the Animas 
        and San Juan Rivers in response to the Gold King Mine spill.
            (2) Requirement.--The program under paragraph (1) shall 
        provide--
                    (A) full disclosure to the public of applicable 
                water quality and sediment data; and
                    (B) a clear and meaningful comparison between those 
                data and all relevant water quality standards.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Administrator should--
            (1) consult with all local communities along the Animas and 
        San Juan Rivers affected by the Gold King Mine spill, the 
        Navajo Nation, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, and the States of 
        Colorado and New Mexico to determine whether it is appropriate 
        to seek a designation for the Upper Animas River watershed on 
        the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive 
        Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
        (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.); and
            (2) prioritize the construction of a water treatment plant 
        in the Upper Animas River basin to significantly reduce the 
        ongoing heavy metal discharge into the Animas River from Cement 
        Creek.

                and
                    ``(B) to establish a priority plan for activities

        the physical, chemical, and geological attributes of closed, 
        abandoned, and inactive mines and pursue technological 
        developments to aid in the cleanup of those mines.
    ``(b) Actions Prior to Certain Activities.--Before conducting any 
activity at a mine that presents the significant potential for 
accidental discharge of a hazardous substance or other pollutant, the 
Administrator or the head of any other Federal department or agency 
carrying out an activity for mine remediation shall--
            ``(1) provide to each tribal, State, and local unit of 
        government the resources or residents of which may be affected 
        by such a discharge notice regarding the activity; and
            ``(2) develop a spill prevention, control, and 
        countermeasures plan to avoid and mitigate the impacts of such 
        a discharge.''.

SEC. 7. EFFECT OF ACT.

    Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) provides for 
compensation of any injured person pursuant to this Act (or an
