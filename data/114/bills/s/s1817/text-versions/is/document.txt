            ``(1) In general.--Beginning 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this subsection, when an agency publishes a 
        proposed or final major rule in the Federal Register, the 
        agency shall include a framework for reassessing the major rule 
        under paragraph (2), which shall include--

                objectives of the major rule, including the societal

                basis, or at periodic times, during the implementation 
                of the major rule, including the method by which the 
                agency will invite the public to participate in the 
                review process and seek input from other agencies, 
                taking into account any burden to the public in 
                supplying relevant data to agencies; and
