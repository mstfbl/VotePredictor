        of Prisons, or on its own motion, upon prior notice to the 
        Government, reduce the term of imprisonment for the offense, 
        after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) of 
        title 18, United States Code, the nature and seriousness of the 
        danger to any person or the community, and the post-sentencing 
        conduct of the defendant, if such a reduction is consistent 
        with this section and the amendments made by this section.

    ``(g) Inadequacy of Criminal History.--
            ``(1) In general.--If subsection (f) does not apply to a 
        defendant because the defendant does not meet the requirements 
        described in subsection (f)(1) (relating to criminal history), 
        the court may, upon prior notice to the Government, waive 
        subsection (f)(1) if the court specifies in writing the 
        specific reasons why reliable information indicates that 
        excluding the defendant pursuant to subsection (f)(1) 
        substantially overrepresents the seriousness of the defendant's 
        criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will 
        commit other crimes.
            ``(2) Prohibition.--This subsection shall not apply to any 
        defendant who has been convicted of a serious drug felony or a

        that is punishable by imprisonment under any law of the United 
        States, or of a State or foreign country, that prohibits or 
        restricts the importation, manufacture, or distribution of

Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960 and 963) for which the statutory 
minimum term of imprisonment is 10 years, the court may impose a 
sentence as if the statutory minimum term of imprisonment was 5 years,

afforded the opportunity to make a recommendation, that--
            ``(1) the defendant does not have a prior conviction for a 
        serious drug felony or serious violent felony as defined in 
        paragraphs (57) and (58), respectively, of section 102 of the

        threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous 
        weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection

        serious bodily injury to any person;
            ``(3) the defendant did not play an enhanced role in the 
        offense by acting as an organizer, leader, manager, or

        authority or control over the criminal activity of a criminal 
        organization, regardless of whether the defendant was a member 
        of such organization;

        information and evidence the defendant has concerning the 
        offense or offenses that were part of the same course of 
        conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the 
        defendant has no relevant or useful other information to 
        provide or that the Government is already aware of the 
        information shall not preclude a determination by the court 
        that the defendant has complied with this requirement.

``Sec. 3621A. Post-sentencing risk and needs assessment system
    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 30 months after the date of the 
enactment of this section, the Attorney General shall develop for use 
by the Bureau of Prisons an offender risk and needs assessment system, 
to be known as the `Post-Sentencing Risk and Needs Assessment System' 
or the `Assessment System', which shall--
            ``(1) assess and determine the recidivism risk level of all 
        prisoners and classify each prisoner as having a low, moderate, 
        or high risk of recidivism;
            ``(2) to the extent practicable, assess and determine the 
        risk of violence of all prisoners;
            ``(3) ensure that, to the extent practicable, low-risk 
        prisoners are grouped together in housing and assignment 
        decisions;
            ``(4) assign each prisoner to appropriate recidivism 
        reduction programs or productive activities based on the 
        prisoner's risk level and the specific criminogenic needs of 
        the prisoner, and in accordance with section 3621(h)(4);
            ``(5) reassess and update the recidivism risk level and 
        programmatic needs of each prisoner pursuant to the schedule 
        set forth in subsection (c)(2), and assess changes in the 
        prisoner's recidivism risk within a particular risk level; and
            ``(6) provide information on best practices concerning the 
        tailoring of recidivism reduction programs to the specific 
        criminogenic needs of each prisoner so as to effectively lower 
        the prisoner's risk of recidivating.
    ``(b) Development of System.--
            ``(1) In general.--In designing the Assessment System, the 
        Attorney General shall--
                    ``(A) use available research and best practices in 
                the field and consult with academic and other criminal

                and behavior changes over time, through meaningful 
                consideration of dynamic risk factors, such that--

                        other than low risk have a meaningful 
                        opportunity to progress to a lower risk 
                        classification during the period of the 
                        incarceration of the prisoner through changes 
                        in dynamic risk factors; and
                            ``(ii) all prisoners on prerelease custody, 
                        other than prisoners classified as low risk, 
                        have a meaningful opportunity to progress to a 
                        lower risk classification during such custody 
                        through changes in dynamic risk factors;
                    ``(C) ensure that the Assessment System is adjusted 
                on a regular basis, but not less frequently than every 
                3 years, to take account of the best statistical 
                evidence of effectiveness in reducing recidivism rates; 
                and
                    ``(D) ensure that the Assessment System does not 
                result in unwarranted disparities, including by--

                        recidivism among similarly classified prisoners 
                        to identify any unwarranted disparities in such 
                        rates, including disparities among similarly 
                        classified prisoners of different racial 
                        groups; and

                        possible.
            ``(2) Risk and needs assessment tools.--In carrying out 
        this subsection, the Attorney General shall--
                    ``(A) develop a suitable intake assessment tool to 
                perform the initial assessments and determinations 
                described in subsection (a)(1), and to make the 
                assignments described in subsection (a)(3);

                perform the reassessments and updates described in 
                subsection (a)(4); and
                    ``(C) develop a suitable tool to assess the 
                recidivism risk level of prisoners in prerelease 
                custody.
            ``(3) Use of existing risk and needs assessment tools 
        permitted.--In carrying out this subsection, the Attorney 
        General may use existing risk and needs assessment tools, as 
        appropriate, for the assessment tools required under paragraph 
        (2).
            ``(4) Use of presentence report.--In carrying out this 
        subsection, the Attorney General shall coordinate with the 
        United States Probation and Pretrial Services to ensure that 
        the findings of the Presentence Report of each offender are 
        available and considered in the Assessment System.
            ``(5) Validation.--In carrying out this subsection, the 
        Attorney General shall statistically validate the risk and 
        needs assessment tools on the Federal prison population, or 
        ensure that the tools have been so validated. To the extent 
        such validation cannot be completed with the time period 
        specified in subsection (a), the Attorney General shall ensure 
        that such validation is completed as soon as is practicable.
            ``(6) Relationship with existing classification systems.--
        The Bureau of Prisons may incorporate its existing Inmate 
        Classification System into the Assessment System if the 
        Assessment System assesses the risk level and criminogenic 
        needs of each prisoner and determines the appropriate security 
        level institution for each prisoner. Before the development of 
        the Assessment System, the Bureau of Prisons may use the 
        existing Inmate Classification System, or a pre-existing risk 
        and needs assessment tool that can be used to classify 
        prisoners consistent with subsection (a)(1), or can be 
        reasonably adapted for such purpose, for purposes of this 
        section, section 3621(h), and section 3624(c).
    ``(c) Risk Assessment.--
            ``(1) Initial assessments.--Not later than 30 months after 
        the date on which the Attorney General develops the Assessment 
        System, the Bureau of Prisons shall determine the risk level of 
        each prisoner using the Assessment System.
            ``(2) Reassessments and updates.--The Bureau of Prisons 
        shall update the assessment of each prisoner required under 
        paragraph (1)--

                any prisoner whose anticipated release date is within 3 
                years;

                for any prisoner whose anticipated release date is 
                within 10 years; and
                    ``(C) not less frequently than once every 3 years 
                for any other prisoner.
    ``(d) Assignment of Recidivism Reduction Programs or Productive 
Activities.--The Assessment System shall provide guidance on the kind 
and amount of recidivism reduction programming or productive activities 
appropriate for each prisoner.
    ``(e) Bureau of Prisons Training.--The Attorney General shall 
develop training protocols and programs for Bureau of Prisons officials 
and employees responsible for administering the Assessment System. Such 
training protocols shall include a requirement that personnel of the 
Bureau of Prisons demonstrate competence in using the methodology and 
procedure developed under this section on a regular basis.
    ``(f) Information From Presentence Report.--The Attorney General 
shall ensure that the Bureau of Prisons uses relevant information from 
the Presentence Report of each offenders when conducting an assessment 
under this section.

Prisons is using the Assessment System in an appropriate and consistent 
manner, the Attorney General shall monitor and assess the use of the 
Assessment System and shall conduct periodic audits of the use of the 
Assessment System at facilities of the Bureau of Prisons.
    ``(h) Determinations and Classifications Unreviewable.--Subject to 
any constitutional limitations, there shall be no right of review, 
right of appeal, cognizable property interest, or cause of action, 
either administrative or judicial, arising from any determination or 
classification made by any Federal agency or employee while 
implementing or administering the Assessment System, or any rules or 
regulations promulgated under this section.
    ``(i) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Dynamic risk factor.--The term `dynamic risk factor' 
        means a characteristic or attribute that has been shown to be 
        relevant to assessing risk of recidivism and that can be 
        modified based on a prisoner's actions, behaviors, or 
        attitudes, including through completion of appropriate 
        programming or other means, in a prison setting.
            ``(2) Recidivism risk.--The term `recidivism risk' means 
        the likelihood that a prisoner will commit additional crimes

        impose additional conditions on the prisoner's prerelease 
        custody as the Director of the Bureau of Prisons deems 
        appropriate. If the violation is nontechnical in nature, the 
        Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall revoke the prisoner's 
        prerelease custody.
            ``(7) Credit for prerelease custody.--Upon completion of a 
        prisoner's sentence, any term of supervised release imposed on 
        the prisoner shall be reduced by the amount of time the

        services.--The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall, to the

        United States Probation and Pretrial Services to supervise 
        prisoners placed in home confinement or community supervision 
        under this subsection. Such agreements shall authorize United 
        States Probation and Pretrial Services to exercise the 
        authority granted to the Director of the Bureau of Prisons 
        pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5), and (12). Such agreements 
        shall take into account the resource requirements of United 
        States Probation and Pretrial Services as a result of the 
        transfer of Bureau of Prisons inmates to prerelease custody and 
        shall provide for the transfer of monetary sums necessary to 
        comply with such requirements. United States Probation and 
        Pretrial Services shall, to the greatest extent practicable, 
        offer assistance to any prisoner not under its supervision 
        during prerelease custody under this subsection.''; and
            (5) by inserting at the end the following:
            ``(12) Determination of appropriate conditions for 
        prerelease custody.--In determining appropriate conditions for 
        prerelease custody pursuant to this subsection, and in 
        accordance with paragraph (5), the Director of the Bureau of 
        Prisons shall, to the extent practicable, subject prisoners who 
        demonstrate continued compliance with the requirements of such 
        prerelease custody to increasingly less restrictive conditions, 
        so as to most effectively prepare such prisoners for reentry. 
        No prisoner shall be transferred to community supervision 
        unless the length of the prisoner's eligibility for community 
        supervision pursuant to paragraph (5) is equivalent to or 
        greater than the length of the prisoner's remaining period of 
        prerelease custody.
            ``(13) Aliens subject to deportation.--If the prisoner is 
        an alien whose deportation was ordered as a condition of 
        supervised release or who is subject to a detainer filed by 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the purposes of 
        determining the alien's deportability, the Director of the 
        Bureau of Prisons shall, upon the prisoner's transfer to 
        prerelease custody pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), deliver 
        the prisoner to United States Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement for the purpose of conducting proceedings relating 
        to the alien's deportation.

                        resulting from any decrease in recidivism that 
                        may be attributed to the implementation of the

                        System or the increase in recidivism reduction
