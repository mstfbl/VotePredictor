 To identify and combat corruption in countries, to establish a tiered 
   system of countries with respect to levels of corruption by their 
governments and their efforts to combat such corruption, and to assess 
 United States assistance to designated countries in order to advance 
  anti-corruption efforts in those countries and better serve United

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Global Corruption and 
Ensuring Accountability Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Corruption erodes trust and confidence in democratic 
        institutions, the rule of law, and human rights protections.
            (2) Highly corrupt governments deliberately weaken state 
        institutions, especially those associated with democratic 
        accountability, in order to improve their chances of remaining 
        in power.
            (3) A direct correlation exists between highly corrupt 
        governments and human rights abuses within countries ruled by 
        such governments.
            (4) Corruption--
                    (A) frustrates the ability of the United States to 
                combat terrorism;
                    (B) helps to foster the conditions for violent 
                extremism; and
                    (C) endangers national and international security.
            (5) Corruption damages United States competitiveness 
        globally and creates barriers to economic growth overseas.
            (6) Anti-corruption measures are instrumental in protecting 
        human rights and achieving sustainable economic growth, which 
        benefits a country's citizens and the international community 
        through the creation of open and transparent markets.
            (7) Eliminating corruption requires greater transparency 
        and accountability and effective civilian oversight.
            (8) Deterring corruption requires the credible threat of 
        prosecution to deter corrupt public servants from abusing their 
        authority with impunity for political or financial gains, in 
        collusion with private entities.
            (9) The United States is a signatory to the United Nations 
        Convention Against Corruption, having ratified the treaty on 
        October 30, 2006.
            (10) United States foreign assistance could be used to 
        encourage actors within highly corrupt countries to support a 
        more inclusive, just, and democratic political and economic 
        system that ultimately contributes to regional stability, 
        credible and legitimate United States partners, and markets for 
        goods produced in the United States.
            (11) Preventing corruption requires implementing democracy 
        and governance programs within countries receiving United 
        States foreign assistance, including--
                    (A) anti-corruption training;
                    (B) anti-corruption technical assistance to 
                national human rights institutions;
                    (C) support for civilian anti-corruption oversight 
                capabilities;
                    (D) the development of anti-corruption legal 
                mechanisms; and
                    (E) increased asset recovery and auditing 
                capabilities.
            (12) Poorly directed foreign assistance could inadvertently 
        contribute to exclusive political and economic systems that--
                    (A) contribute to insecurity within the countries 
                receiving such assistance;
                    (B) stymie their citizens' democratic and economic 
                aspirations;
                    (C) discourage a free press and civil society; and
                    (D) impede United States foreign policy goals.
            (13) Effective corruption risk assessment and analysis 
        before, during, and after the provision of foreign assistance 
        is a key element for reducing and eliminating corruption.
            (14) Comprehensive and timely data on foreign assistance 
        programs is the first step to greater accountability and 
        scrutiny by donor institutions, recipient states, and civil 
        society.
            (15) Foreign assistance provided to the security sector of 
        a foreign country is not effective at strengthening weak 
        defense and security forces unless it is properly provided and 
        closely monitored for corruption, including diversion and 
        misuse.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to combat corruption in countries by requiring the 
        Secretary of State to establish and report on corruption in 
        such countries and the efforts of the governments of such 
        countries in combating such corruption;
            (2) to assess United States foreign assistance to 
        designated countries based on the corruption reports; and
            (3) to improve the transparency and accountability of 
        United States foreign assistance.

SEC. 8. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CORRUPTION AND BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP.

    It is the sense of Congress that identifying the true beneficial 
owners of companies formed in the United States or abroad, and property 
that has been removed from a country in connection with corrupt 
activities by corrupt leaders or other corrupt actors, is an important 
part of combating corruption, and the President should develop a 
comprehensive approach to requiring such beneficial ownership 
information for companies formed in the United States or abroad, and 
intensify cooperative efforts with U.S. allies toward those ends.
