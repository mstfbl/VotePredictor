                        the satellite portfolio of the Administration 
                        more robust and cost-effective;
                            (iii) assess the costs and benefits of 
                        moving toward a constellation of many small 
                        satellites, standardizing satellite bus design, 
                        relying more on the purchasing of data, or

                        observations that are essential to the

                        assessment of Federal, academic, and private 
                        sector weather research, and the cost of 
                        obtaining the environmental data;
                            (v) identify environmental observations 
                        that improve the quality of weather forecasts, 
                        but are not essential for the generation of 
                        weather models in effect on the day before the 
                        date of enactment of this Act; and

                        of environmental observations that balances 
                        essential and quality-improving data, private 
                        and nonprivate sources, and space- and Earth-
                        based instruments.
                    (C) Deadline and report.--In carrying out the study

                Administrator enters into an agreement with the 
                National Academy of Sciences under paragraph (1)(A).
                    (D) Coordination of efforts.--In order to avoid 
                duplication, the National Academy of Sciences may 
                coordinate its efforts to draft the report under 
                subparagraph (C) with the preparation of the 2017 study 
                entitled ``Earth Science and Applications from Space''.

                into an agreement described in paragraph (1)(A) with 
                the National Academy of Sciences on terms acceptable to 
                the Administrator, the Administrator shall seek to 
                enter into such an agreement with another appropriate 
                organization that--

                        comparable to that of the National Academy of 
                        Sciences.
                    (B) Treatment.--If the Administrator enters into an 
                agreement with another organization as described in 
                subparagraph (A), any reference in this section to the 
                National Academy of Sciences shall be treated as a 
                reference to the other organization.
            (4) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized 
        to be appropriated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
