                and operationalize the radio occultation program of 
                record in effect on the day before the date of the 
                enactment of this Act--
                            (i) by deploying constellations of 
                        microsatellites in both the equatorial and

        consultation with the National Weather Service and Office of 
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, shall--
                    (A) integrate additional coastal and ocean 
                observations, and other data and research, from the 
                Integrated Ocean Observing System of the Administration 
                (referred to in this section as ``IOOS'') into regional 
                weather forecasts to improve weather forecasts and 
                forecasting decision support systems; and
                    (B) support the development of real time data 
                sharing products and forecast products in collaboration

                research institutions to ensure timely and accurate use 
                of ocean and coastal data in regional forecasts.
            (5) Existing monitoring and observation infrastructure.--
        The Administrator shall identify degradation of existing 
        monitoring and observation infrastructure that could lead to a 
        reduction in forecast quality.

        operational needs.--In developing specifications for any 
        satellite systems of the Administration to follow after the 
        Joint Polar Satellite System, Geostationary Operational 
        Environmental Satellites, and any other satellites of the 
        Administration in effect on the day before the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall ensure the 
        specifications are determined to the extent practicable by the 
        recommendations of the reports under subsection (b) of this

                        observations that are essential to the 
                        performance of weather models, based on an 
                        assessment of Federal, academic, and private 
                        sector weather research, and the cost of 
                        obtaining the environmental data;
                            (v) identify environmental observations 
                        that improve the quality of weather forecasts, 
                        but are not essential for the generation of 
                        weather models in effect on the day before the 
                        date of enactment of this Act; and
                            (vi) develop recommendations on a portfolio 
                        of environmental observations that balances 
                        essential and quality-improving data, private 
                        and nonprivate sources, and space- and Earth-
