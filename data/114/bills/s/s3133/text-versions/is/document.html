SEC. 3. REPORT.

    Not later than 1 year after the data reported under the amendments 
made by section 2 is made available to the Administrator of the Office 
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the Comptroller General 
of the United States, in coordination with the Administrator, shall 
submit to Congress a report on--
            (1) differences in the administration and collection of 
        fees across jurisdictions, across racial demographics, and 
        across income levels, including fee amounts, collection costs, 
        and the use of hearings to determine the ability to pay of 
        juveniles or their legal guardians;
            (2) the extent to which differences in the administration 
        and collection of fees across jurisdictions affects or is 
        associated with differences in the rates and types of juvenile 
        involvement in the justice system and rates of recidivism 
        across those jurisdictions; and
            (3) the extent to which the failure to pay fees by 
        juveniles or their legal guardians results in detention or 
        confinement not otherwise ordered, exclusion from diversion 
        programming or failure to expunge or seal a juvenile record.
