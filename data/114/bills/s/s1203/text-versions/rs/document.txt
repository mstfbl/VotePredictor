    ``(a) In General.--In the case of a hospital of the Department that 
has an emergency department, if any individual comes to the hospital or 
the campus of the hospital and a request is made on behalf of the 
individual for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the 
hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination 
within the capability of the emergency department, including ancillary 
services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine 
whether or not an emergency medical condition exists.
    ``(b) Necessary Stabilizing Treatment for Emergency Medical 
Conditions and Labor.--(1) If any individual comes to a hospital of the 
Department that has an emergency department or the campus of such a 
hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an 
emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either--
            ``(A) within the staff and facilities available at the 
        hospital, for such further medical examination and such 
        treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical 
        condition; or
            ``(B) for transfer of the individual to another medical 
        facility in accordance with subsection (c).
    ``(2) A hospital is deemed to meet the requirement of paragraph 
(1)(A) with respect to an individual if the hospital offers the 
individual the further medical examination and treatment described in 
that paragraph and informs the individual (or a person acting on behalf 
of the individual) of the risks and benefits to the individual of such 
examination and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on 
behalf of the individual) refuses to consent to the examination and 
treatment. The hospital shall take all reasonable steps to secure the 
written informed consent of the individual (or person) to refuse such 
examination and treatment.
    ``(3) A hospital is deemed to meet the requirement of paragraph (1) 
with respect to an individual if the hospital offers to transfer the 
individual to another medical facility in accordance with subsection 
(c) and informs the individual (or a person acting on behalf of the 
individual) of the risks and benefits to the individual of such 
transfer, but the individual (or a person acting on behalf of the 
individual) refuses to consent to the transfer. The hospital shall take 
all reasonable steps to secure the written informed consent of the 
individual (or person) to refuse such transfer.
    ``(c) Restricting Transfers Until Individual Stabilized.--(1) If an 
individual at a hospital of the Department has an emergency medical 
condition that has not been stabilized, the hospital may not transfer 
the individual unless--
            ``(A)(i) the individual (or a legally responsible person 
        acting on behalf of the individual), after being informed of 
        the obligations of the hospital under this section and of the 
        risk of transfer, requests, in writing, transfer to another 
        medical facility;
            ``(ii) a physician of the Department has signed a 
        certification that, based upon the information available at the 
        time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from

        medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual 
        and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child from effecting 
        the transfer; or
            ``(iii) if a physician of the Department is not physically 
        present in the emergency department at the time an individual 
        is transferred, a qualified medical person (as defined by the 
        Secretary for purposes of this section) has signed a 
        certification described in clause (ii) after a physician of the 
        Department, in consultation with the person, has made the 
        determination described in such clause, and subsequently 
        countersigns the certification; and
            ``(B) the transfer is an appropriate transfer to that 
        facility.
    ``(2) A certification described in clause (ii) or (iii) of 
paragraph (1)(A) shall include a summary of the risks and benefits upon 
which the certification is based.
    ``(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), an appropriate transfer to 
a medical facility is a transfer--
            ``(A) in which the transferring hospital provides the 
        medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks 
        to the health of the individual and, in the case of a woman in 
        labor, the health of the unborn child;
            ``(B) in which the receiving facility--
                    ``(i) has available space and qualified personnel

                individual and to provide appropriate medical 
                treatment;

        receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof) 
        available at the time of the transfer relating to the emergency 
        medical condition for which the individual has presented,
