                                 A BILL


 
                    To improve medication adherence.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Eighty to ninety percent of the means by which we 
        prevent and control chronic disease is with medications. 
        Assuring the most appropriate and effective medications are 
        used to optimize patient outcomes is a national priority. The 
        ability of patients to then adhere to the medication regimen 
        becomes vital.
            (2) Between \1/2\ and \2/3\ of individuals with chronic 
        diseases in the United States do not take medications as 
        prescribed.
            (3) Suboptimal medication use, including untreated 
        indications (such as failure to immunize), over or under dosing 
        of medications, safety issues, and low rates of medication 
        adherence result in higher health care costs, reduced 
        effectiveness of health care treatments and regimes, negative 
        health effects for patients, and tens of thousands of deaths on 
        an annual basis.
            (4) Appropriate medication use and adherence may be lowest 
        among individuals with chronic diseases.
            (5) Improving medication adherence would reduce unnecessary 
        hospital admissions and emergency room visits.
            (6) Drug therapy problems including underuse and 
        nonadherence is estimated to cost the healthcare system in the 
        United States over $290,000,000,000 each year.
            (7) Improving appropriate medication adherence could 
        improve patient health outcomes, reduce health care costs, and 
        lead to productivity gains.
