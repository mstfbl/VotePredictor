Enter Into Certain Leases With Components of the Armed Forces.--The 
Secretary of Transportation may not disapprove a project grant 
application under this subchapter for an airport development project at 
an airport solely because the airport enters into or renews a lease for 
the use, at a nominal rate, of airport property by a regular or reserve 
component of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard, without 
regard to whether that component operates aircraft at the airport.''.
