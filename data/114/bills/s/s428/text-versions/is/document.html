                                 A BILL


 
 To amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act to provide for 
12-month continuous enrollment under Medicaid and the Children's Health 
               Insurance Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stabilize Medicaid and CHIP Coverage 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Every year millions of people are enrolled in Medicaid 
        and the Children's Health Insurance Program (in this section 
        referred to as ``CHIP''), but subsequently lose their coverage, 
        despite still being eligible, because of inefficient and 
        cumbersome paperwork and logistical requirements.
            (2) Data show that the typical enrollee receives Medicaid 
        coverage for about \3/4\ of the year and that coverage periods 
        are lower for non-elderly, non-disabled adults than for those 
        with disabilities, seniors, and children.
            (3) Medicaid enrollees with coverage disruption are more 
        likely to be hospitalized for illnesses, like asthma, diabetes, 
        or cardiovascular disease, that can be effectively managed 
        through ongoing primary medical care and medication, are less 
        likely to be screened for breast cancer, and may have poorer 
        cancer outcomes.
            (4) Children enrolled in CHIP also experience disruptions 
        in health coverage and care. For example, during just a 1-year 
        period, over \1/3\ of CHIP enrollees were also enrolled in a 
        State's Medicaid program. Transitions between Medicaid and CHIP 
        can cause disruptions in care because the health care coverage 
        and participating providers vary between the two programs.
            (5) Interruptions in coverage can impair the receipt of 
        effective primary care and lead to expensive hospitalizations 
        or emergency room visits.
            (6) Unnecessary enrollment, disenrollment, and reenrollment 
        in Medicaid and CHIP result in higher administrative expenses 
        for reenrollment and result in more people uninsured at any 
        given time.
            (7) Stable coverage under Medicaid and CHIP lowers average 
        monthly medical costs. Continuous enrollment also permits 
        better prevention and disease management, leading to fewer 
        serious illnesses and hospitalizations.
            (8) Children with stable coverage are less likely to have 
        unmet medical needs, allowing children to receive the 
        preventive care that is necessary to help them grow into 
        healthy adults.

SEC. 3. 12-MONTH CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT.

    (a) Requirement of 12-Month Continuous Enrollment Under Medicaid.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1902(e)(12) of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(e)), is amended to read as follows:

                pursuant to section 1115 or section 1915, shall provide 
                that an individual who is determined to be eligible for

        State legislature.

              IMPROVEMENTS FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.

    Section 1903 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(aa) Performance Bonuses for Enrollment and Retention of Low-
