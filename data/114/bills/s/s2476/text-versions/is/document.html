 To exclude power supply circuits, drivers, and devices designed to be 
    connected to, and power, light-emitting diodes or organic light-
  emitting diodes providing illumination or ceiling fans using direct 
 current motors from energy conservation standards for external power 
                               supplies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. APPLICATION OF ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS TO CERTAIN 
              EXTERNAL POWER SUPPLIES.

    (a) Definition of External Power Supply.--Section 321(36)(A) of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6291(36)(A)) is amended--
            (1) by striking the subparagraph designation and all that 
        follows through ``The term'' and inserting the following:
                    ``(A) External power supply.--

                        supply' does not include a power supply 
                        circuit, driver, or device that is designed 
                        exclusively to be connected to, and power--
                                    ``(I) light-emitting diodes 
                                providing illumination;
                                    ``(II) organic light-emitting 
                                diodes providing illumination; or
                                    ``(III) ceiling fans using direct 
                                current motors.''.
    (b) Standards for Lighting Power Supply Circuits.--
            (1) Definition.--Section 340(2)(B) of the Energy Policy and 
        Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6311(2)(B)) is amended by striking

                            ``(v) electric lights and lighting power 
                        supply circuits;''.
            (2) Energy conservation standard for certain equipment.--
        Section 342 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
        U.S.C. 6313) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(g) Lighting Power Supply Circuits.--If the Secretary, acting

lighting power supply circuits, drivers, or devices described in 
section 321(36)(A)(ii), the Secretary may prescribe under this part, 
not earlier than 1 year after the date on which a test procedure has 
been prescribed, an energy conservation standard for such equipment.''.
    (c) Technical Corrections.--
            (1) Section 321(6)(B) of the Energy Policy and Conservation 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 6291(6)(B)) is amended by striking ``(19)'' and
