To require a coordinated response to coal fuel supply emergencies that 
      could impact electric power system adequacy or reliability.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Severe Fuel Supply Emergency 
Response Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. SEVERE FUEL SUPPLY EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

    The Federal Power Act is amended by inserting after section 215 (16 
U.S.C. 824o) the following:

``SEC. 215A. EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO COAL SUPPLY DEFICIENCIES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) electric utilities operating coal-fired generating 
        units seek to maintain target levels of coal inventories in 
        order to meet forecasted demand;
            ``(2) by coordinating generator actions and coal levels 
        with Reliability Coordinators, electric utilities seek to 
        ensure adequacy and reliability for the Bulk Power System;
            ``(3) rail service issues have resulted in critically low 
        coal inventory levels at numerous utilities;
            ``(4) coal shortages can threaten the adequacy and 
        reliability of electricity supplies, and may jeopardize the 
        health and safety of electricity consumers;
            ``(5) when faced with declining coal inventories, electric 
        utilities have taken actions to curtail coal-fired electricity 
        production, including by closing electric generating units, in 
        order to preserve coal stockpiles;
            ``(6) under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 
        (15 U.S.C. 761 et seq.), electric utilities are required to 
        file a mandatory Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance 
        Report with the Department of Energy regarding fuel supply 
        emergencies that could impact electric power system adequacy or 
        reliability; and
            ``(7) the depletion of coal inventories due to rail service 
        issues may constitute a fuel supply emergency.
    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:
