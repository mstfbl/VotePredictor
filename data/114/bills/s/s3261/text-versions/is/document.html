To establish a business incubators program within the Department of the 
    Interior to promote economic development in Indian reservation 
                              communities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business Incubators 
Program Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) entrepreneurs face specific challenges when 
        transforming ideas into profitable business enterprises;
            (2) entrepreneurs that want to provide products and 
        services in reservation communities face an additional set of 
        challenges that requires special knowledge;
            (3) a business incubator is an organization that assists 
        entrepreneurs in navigating obstacles that prevent innovative 
        ideas from becoming viable businesses by providing services 
        that include--
                    (A) workspace and facilities resources;
                    (B) access to capital, business education, and 
                counseling;
                    (C) networking opportunities;
                    (D) mentorship opportunities; and
                    (E) an environment intended to help establish and 
                expand business operations;
            (4) the business incubator model is suited to accelerating 
        entrepreneurship in reservation communities because the 
        business incubator model promotes collaboration to address 
        shared challenges and provides individually tailored services 
        for the purpose of overcoming obstacles unique to each 
        participating business; and
            (5) business incubators will stimulate economic development 
        by providing Native entrepreneurs with the tools necessary to 
        grow businesses that offer products and services to reservation 
        communities.

                        incubator of the eligible applicant, as

                                the 1 or more reservation communities 
                                served by the business incubator;
                                    (II) the 1 or more reservation 
                                communities served by the business 
                                incubator have benefited and will 
                                continue to benefit from the services 
                                of the business incubator; and

                                to receive similar services because of 
                                remoteness or other reasons that 
                                inhibit the provision of business and
