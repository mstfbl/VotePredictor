needs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Priority.--In allocating amounts under section 201(b), 
in addition to considering the funding priorities described in section

        in paragraph (1), if the full amount under section 201(b) 
        cannot be fully allocated to eligible Indian dams because the 
        costs of the remaining activities authorized in section 201(b) 
        of an Indian dam would exceed the cap described in paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary may allocate the remaining funds to eligible 
        Indian dams in accordance with this subtitle.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Basis of Funding.--Any amounts made available under 
this section shall be nonreimbursable.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
