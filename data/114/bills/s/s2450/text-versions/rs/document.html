                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 5, United States Code, to address administrative leave 
             for Federal employees, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Administrative Leave Act of 
2016''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) agency use of administrative leave, and leave 
        that is referred to incorrectly as administrative leave in 
        agency recording practices, has exceeded reasonable amounts--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in contravention of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) established precedent of the 
                        Comptroller General of the United States; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) guidance provided by the 
                        Office of Personnel Management; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) resulting in significant cost to the 
                Federal Government;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) administrative leave should be used 
        sparingly;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) prior to the use of administrative leave, an 
        agency should consider other actions, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) temporary reassignment;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) transfer; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) telework;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) an agency should prioritize and expeditiously 
        conclude an investigation in which an employee is placed in 
        administrative leave so that, not later than the conclusion of 
        the leave period--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the employee is returned to duty 
                status; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) an appropriate personnel action is 
                taken with respect to the employee;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) data show that there are too many examples of 
        employees placed in administrative leave for 6 months or 
        longer, leaving the employees without any available recourse 
        to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) return to duty status; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) challenge the decision of the 
                agency;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) an agency should ensure accurate and 
        consistent recording of the use of administrative leave so that 
        administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) other forms of excused absence authorized by 
        law should be recorded separately from administrative leave, as 
        defined by this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 63 of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the

        of an employee in investigative or notice leave under

        jeopardized legitimate Government interests, including whether 
        any agency abused the authority of the agency by making such a

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Administrative Leave Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) agency use of administrative leave, and leave that is 
        referred to incorrectly as administrative leave in agency 
        recording practices, has exceeded reasonable amounts--
                    (A) in contravention of--
                            (i) established precedent of the 
                        Comptroller General of the United States; and
                            (ii) guidance provided by the Office of 
                        Personnel Management; and
                    (B) resulting in significant cost to the Federal 
                Government;
            (2) administrative leave should be used sparingly;
            (3) prior to the use of paid leave to address personnel 
        issues, an agency should consider other actions, including--
                    (A) temporary reassignment;
                    (B) transfer; and
                    (C) telework;
            (4) an agency should prioritize and expeditiously conclude 
        an investigation in which an employee is placed in 
        administrative leave so that, not later than the conclusion of 
        the leave period--
                    (A) the employee is returned to duty status; or
                    (B) an appropriate personnel action is taken with 
                respect to the employee;
            (5) data show that there are too many examples of employees 
        placed in administrative leave for 6 months or longer, leaving 
        the employees without any available recourse to--
                    (A) return to duty status; or
                    (B) challenge the decision of the agency;
            (6) an agency should ensure accurate and consistent 
        recording of the use of administrative leave so that 
        administrative leave can be managed and overseen effectively; 
        and
            (7) other forms of excused absence authorized by law should 
        be recorded separately from administrative leave, as defined by 
        the amendments made by this Act.
