                                 A BILL


 
    To improve hiring and human resources flexibilities for Federal 
     agencies in geographic areas affected by unique situations or 
    circumstances, including remoteness, that cause recruitment and 
    retention challenges, and to provide agencies experiencing such 
  challenges with a toolkit of resources to overcome those challenges.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Flexible Hiring and Improving 
Recruitment, Retention, and Education Act of 2016'' or the ``Flexible 
HIRE Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Federal agencies should take aggressive action to 
        respond to hiring and retention challenges in geographic areas 
        affected by a unique situation or circumstance, including when 
        such challenges develop from a need to fill positions or retain 
        employees due to the remoteness of the geographic area in 
        question;
            (2) to respond to such challenges, Federal agencies should 
        take advantage of all appropriate hiring and human resources 
        flexibilities, including special pay rates and recruitment, 
        relocation, and retention bonuses; and
            (3) both the Office of Personnel Management and all Federal 
        agencies have a significant responsibility to ensure that 
        hiring and human resources flexibilities are as accessible as 
        possible to Federal employees in geographic areas affected by a 
        unique situation or circumstance.
