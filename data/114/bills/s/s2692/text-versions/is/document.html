                                 A BILL


 
    To counter foreign disinformation and propaganda, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Information Warfare Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) foreign governments, including the Governments of the 
        Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, use 
        disinformation and other propaganda tools to undermine the 
        national security objectives of the United States and key 
        allies and partners;
            (2) the Russian Federation, in particular, has conducted 
        sophisticated and large-scale disinformation campaigns that 
        have sought to have a destabilizing effect on United States 
        allies and interests;
            (3) in the last decade disinformation has increasingly 
        become a key feature of the Government of the Russian 
        Federation's pursuit of political, economic, and military 
        objectives in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, the Balkans, and 
        throughout Central and Eastern Europe;
            (4) the challenge of countering disinformation extends 
        beyond effective strategic communications and public diplomacy, 
        requiring a whole-of-government approach leveraging all 
        elements of national power;
            (5) the United States Government should develop a 
        comprehensive strategy to counter foreign disinformation and 
        propaganda and assert leadership in developing a fact-based 
        strategic narrative; and
            (6) an important element of this strategy should be to 
        protect and promote a free, healthy, and independent press in 
        countries vulnerable to foreign disinformation.

SEC. 3. CENTER FOR INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE.

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, in coordination

        sources;
            (2) to establish a framework for the integration of 
        critical data and analysis on foreign propaganda and 
        disinformation efforts into the development of national 
        strategy; and
            (3) to develop, plan, and synchronize, in coordination with 
        the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National 
        Intelligence, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and other

        initiatives to expose and counter foreign information

    (b) Functions.--The Center shall carry out the following functions:
            (1) Integrating interagency efforts to track and evaluate 
        counterfactual narratives abroad that threaten the national

        information, including intelligence reporting, data, analysis,

        groups, and other nongovernmental organizations.
            (3) Developing and disseminating fact-based narratives and 
        analysis to counter propaganda and disinformation directed at 
        United States allies and partners.
            (4) Identifying current and emerging trends in foreign 
        propaganda and disinformation, including the use of print, 
        broadcast, online and social media, support for third-party 
        outlets such as think tanks, political parties, and 
        nongovernmental organizations, and the use of covert or 
        clandestine special operators and agents to influence targeted 
        populations and governments in order to coordinate and shape 
        the development of tactics, techniques, and procedures to 
        expose and refute foreign misinformation and disinformation and 
        proactively promote fact-based narratives and policies to 
        audiences outside the United States.
