            (2) Guidance.--The Secretary shall establish guidance that 
        each health care provider of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs, before initiating opioid therapy to treat a patient as 
        part of the comprehensive assessment conducted by the health 
        care provider, use the Opioid Therapy Risk Report tool of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs (or any subsequent tool), which 
        shall include information from the prescription drug monitoring 
        program of each participating State as applicable, that 
        includes the most recent information to date relating to the 
        patient that accessed such program to assess the risk for 
        adverse outcomes of opioid therapy for the patient, including 
        the concurrent use of controlled substances such as 
        benzodiazepines, as part of the comprehensive assessment 
        conducted by the health care provider.
            (3) Enhanced standards.--The Secretary shall establish 
        enhanced standards with respect to the use of routine and 
        random urine drug tests for all patients before and during

                update to such guideline.
                    (B) The use of evidence-based pain management 
                therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, non-
                opioid alternatives, and non-drug methods and 
                procedures to managing pain and related health 
                conditions including medical devices approved or 
                cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
                treatment of patients with chronic pain and 
                complementary alternative medicines.
