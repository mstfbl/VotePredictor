SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription opioid painkillers 
        is having a devastating effect on public health and safety in 
        communities across the United States. According to the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths now 
        surpass traffic accidents in the number of deaths caused by 
        injury in the United States. In 2014, an average of more than 
        120 people in the United States died from drug overdoses every 
        day.
            (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse 
        (commonly known as ``NIDA''), the number of prescriptions for 
        opioids increased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to 
        nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the 
        biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost 100 
        percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent for 
        oxycodone.
            (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or 
        abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as 
        ``CPDs'') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose 
        incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network 
        (commonly known as ``DAWN''), the estimated number of emergency 
        department visits involving nonmedical use of prescription 
        opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent between 2006 and 
        2010, from 84,671 to 179,787.
            (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked 
        sharply in recent years. According to the most recent National 
        Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 people in the 
        United States reported using heroin in 2014, nearly a 35 
        percent increase from the previous year. Heroin overdose deaths 
        more than tripled from 2010 to 2014.
            (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United 
        States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the 
        activity of Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The Drug 
        Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ``DEA'') 
        estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have more 
        than doubled since 2010, and heroin production in Mexico 
        increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent of 
        State and local law enforcement officials across the United 
        States identified heroin as the greatest drug threat in their 
        area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in 2015.
            (6) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts 
        throughout the country report that many people who have misused 
        prescription opioids have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more 
        easily obtained alternative to prescription opioids.
            (7) According to a report by the National Association of 
        State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as 
        ``NASADAD''), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to 
        treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while 
        admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500 
        percent from 2000 to 2012.
            (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, 
        including abuse of prescription painkillers and, increasingly, 
        heroin, requires a multipronged approach that involves 
        prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement initiatives, 
        reducing drug diversion and the supply of illicit drugs, 
        expanding delivery of existing treatments (including medication 
        assisted treatments), expanding access to overdose medications 
        and interventions, and the development of new medications for 
        pain that can augment the existing treatment arsenal.
            (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. 
        Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances in 
        the treatment of substance use disorders that help people stop 
        abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume their 
        productive lives.
            (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and 
        Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States 
        needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only 
        2,500,000 people received it. Furthermore, current treatment 
        services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a report 
        commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
        Administration (commonly known as ``SAMHSA''), there are 
        approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 individuals needing 
        substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the ratio is 
        much lower.
            (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and 
        criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is steep, 
        totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according to NIDA. 
        Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major economic 
        dividends.
            (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities 
        properly implement science-validated substance abuse prevention 
        programs, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs is 
        reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents, and healthcare 
        professionals shape the perceptions of youths about the risks 
        of drug abuse.
            (13) Diverting certain individuals with substance use 
        disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based 
        treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable 
        numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the 
        course of those individuals' lives.
            (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, 
        unwanted prescription medications have been collected since the 
        enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 
        2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).
            (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models can provide 
        a critical path to successful recovery for a number of people 
        in the United States. The 2015 membership survey conducted by 
        Alcoholics Anonymous (commonly known as ``AA'') found that 73 
        percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 year and 
        attended 2.5 meetings per week.
            (16) Research shows that combining treatment medications 
        with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate 
        success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be 
        tailored to address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related 
        medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. 
        Different types of medications may be useful at different 
        stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using 
        drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a 
        range of options regarding their path to recovery and many have 
        also successfully addressed drug abuse through the use of 
        faith-based, holistic, or drug-free models.
            (17) Individuals with mental illness, especially severe 
        mental illness, are at considerably higher risk for substance 
        abuse than the general population, and the presence of a mental 
        illness complicates recovery from substance abuse.
            (18) Rural communities are especially susceptible to heroin 
        and opioid abuse. Individuals in rural counties have higher 
        rates of drug poisoning deaths, including deaths from opioids. 
        According to the American Journal of Public Health, ``[O]pioid 
        poisonings in nonmetropolitan counties have increased at a rate 
        greater than threefold the increase in metropolitan counties.'' 
        According to a February 19, 2016, report from the Maine Rural 
        Health Research Center, ``[M]ultiple studies document a higher 
        prevalence [of abuse] among specific vulnerable rural 
        populations, particularly among youth, women who are pregnant 
        or experiencing partner violence, and persons with co-occurring 
        disorders.''

SEC. 103. COMMUNITY-BASED COALITION ENHANCEMENT GRANTS TO ADDRESS LOCAL
