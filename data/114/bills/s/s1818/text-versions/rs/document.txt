SEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.

    (a) In General.--To promote an open exchange with the public, each 
agency shall, consistent with section 553 of title 5, United States 
Code, and other applicable requirements, issue rules through a process 
that involves public participation, including--
            (1) providing the public with a meaningful opportunity to 
        participate in the regulatory process; and
            (2) to the greatest extent feasible--
                    (A) affording the public a meaningful opportunity 
                to submit comments through the Internet on any proposed 
                rule for a period of not less than 60 days;
                    (B) providing, for both proposed and final rules, 
                timely online access to the rule making docket of the 
                agency on an easily accessible Federal website, 
                including relevant scientific and technical findings, 
                in an open, searchable, and downloadable format; and
                    (C) providing an opportunity for public comment on 
                all pertinent parts of the proposed rule making docket 
                of the agency, including relevant scientific and 
                technical findings.
    (b) Comments From Affected Parties.--Before issuing a notice of 
proposed rule making, each agency shall, when feasible and appropriate, 
seek the views of those who are likely to be affected by the rule, 
including those who are likely to benefit from and those who are 
potentially subject to the rule.

SEC. 5. INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION.

    In developing regulatory actions and identifying appropriate 
approaches, each agency shall--
            (1) attempt to promote coordination, simplification, and 
        harmonization; and
            (2) seek to identify, as appropriate, means to achieve 
        regulatory goals that are designed to promote innovation.

SEC. 6. SCIENCE.

    When issuing a rule under section 553, each agency shall ensure 
that any scientific and technological information and processes, 
including models, used to support any regulatory action of the agency 
is the best available, by taking into consideration whether the 
scientific and technological information and processes used are 
objective, peer-reviewed, reproducible, and publically available.
