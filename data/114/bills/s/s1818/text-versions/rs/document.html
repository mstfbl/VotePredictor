                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 5, United States Code, to reform the rule making process 
                              of agencies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Principled Rulemaking Act 
of 2015''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In this Act--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the terms ``agency'', ``rule'', and ``rule 
        making'' have the meanings given those terms in section 551 of 
        title 5, United States Code; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the term ``regulatory action'' means any 
        substantive action by an agency (normally published in the 
        Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to 
        the promulgation of a final regulation, including notices of 
        inquiry, advance notices of proposed rule making, and notices 
        of proposed rule making.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. RULE MAKING CONSIDERATIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(f) Rule Making Considerations.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) In general.--An agency shall only promulgate 
        a rule under this section that is--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) required by law;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) necessary to interpret a law; 
                or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) made necessary by compelling public 
                need, such as a material failure of the private markets 
                to protect or improve the health and safety of the 
                public, the environment, or the wellbeing of the people 
                of the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2) Considerations.--Before promulgating a rule 
        under this section, an agency shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) identify and assess the significance 
                of the problem that the agency intends to address with 
                the rule, including, where applicable, the failures of 
                private markets or public institutions that warrant new 
                agency action;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) consider the legal authority under 
                which the rule may be proposed, including whether a 
                rule making is required by statute, and if so, whether 
                by a specific date, or whether the agency has 
                discretion to commence a rule making;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) examine whether existing rules or 
                other laws--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                manner to achieve the regulatory objective;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        extent practicable, the costs of cumulative

                and easy to understand.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--To promote an open exchange with the 
public, each agency shall, consistent with section 553 of title 5, 
United States Code, and other applicable requirements, issue rules 
through a process that involves public participation, including--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) providing the public with an opportunity to 
        participate in the regulatory process; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to the extent feasible--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) affording the public a meaningful 
                opportunity to submit comments through the Internet on 
                any proposed rule for a period of not less than 60 
                days;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) providing, for both proposed and final 
                rules, timely online access to the rule making docket 
                of the agency on an easily accessible Federal website, 
                including relevant scientific and technical findings, 
                in an open, searchable, and downloadable format; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) providing an opportunity for public 
                comment on all pertinent parts of the proposed rule 
                making docket of the agency, including relevant 
                scientific and technical findings.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Comments From Affected Parties.--Before issuing a 
notice of proposed rule making, each agency shall, when feasible and 
appropriate, seek the views of those who are likely to be affected by 
the rule, including those who are likely to benefit from and those who 
are potentially subject to the rule.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In developing regulatory actions and identifying 
appropriate approaches, each agency shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) attempt to promote coordination, 
        simplification, and harmonization; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) seek to identify, as appropriate, means to 
        achieve regulatory goals that are designed to promote 
        innovation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 6. FLEXIBLE APPROACHES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Where relevant, feasible, and consistent with regulatory 
objectives, and to the extent permitted by law, each agency shall 
identify and consider regulatory approaches that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and 
        freedom of choice for the public;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) include warnings, appropriate default rules, 
        and disclosure requirements; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) provide information to the public in a form 
        that is clear and intelligible.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 7. SCIENCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific 
and technological information and processes used to support each 
regulatory action of the agency.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Principled Rulemaking Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the terms ``agency'', ``rule'', and ``rule making'' 
        have the meanings given those terms in section 551 of title 5, 
        United States Code; and
            (2) the term ``regulatory action''--
                    (A) means any substantive action by an agency 
                (normally published in the Federal Register) that 
                promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation 
                of a final regulation, including notices of inquiry, 
                advance notices of proposed rule making, and notices of 
                proposed rule making; and
                    (B) does not include an action by an agency 
                involving--
                            (i) a military or foreign affairs function 
                        of the United States; or
                            (ii) a matter relating to agency management 
                        or personnel or to public property, loans,

SEC. 3. RULE MAKING CONSIDERATIONS.

    Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following:

                specific date, or whether the agency has discretion to 
                commence a rule making;

SEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.

    (a) In General.--To promote an open exchange with the public, each 
agency shall, consistent with section 553 of title 5, United States 
Code, and other applicable requirements, issue rules through a process 
that involves public participation, including--
            (1) providing the public with a meaningful opportunity to 
        participate in the regulatory process; and
            (2) to the greatest extent feasible--
                    (A) affording the public a meaningful opportunity 
                to submit comments through the Internet on any proposed 
                rule for a period of not less than 60 days;
                    (B) providing, for both proposed and final rules, 
                timely online access to the rule making docket of the 
                agency on an easily accessible Federal website, 
                including relevant scientific and technical findings, 
                in an open, searchable, and downloadable format; and
                    (C) providing an opportunity for public comment on 
                all pertinent parts of the proposed rule making docket 
                of the agency, including relevant scientific and 
                technical findings.
    (b) Comments From Affected Parties.--Before issuing a notice of 
proposed rule making, each agency shall, when feasible and appropriate, 
seek the views of those who are likely to be affected by the rule, 
including those who are likely to benefit from and those who are 
potentially subject to the rule.

SEC. 5. INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION.

    In developing regulatory actions and identifying appropriate 
approaches, each agency shall--
            (1) attempt to promote coordination, simplification, and 
        harmonization; and
            (2) seek to identify, as appropriate, means to achieve 
        regulatory goals that are designed to promote innovation.

SEC. 6. SCIENCE.

    When issuing a rule under section 553, each agency shall ensure 
that any scientific and technological information and processes, 
including models, used to support any regulatory action of the agency 
is the best available, by taking into consideration whether the 
scientific and technological information and processes used are 
objective, peer-reviewed, reproducible, and publically available.
