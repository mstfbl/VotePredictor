                                 A BILL


 
 To amend titles XI and XIX of the Social Security Act to establish a 
  comprehensive and nationwide system to evaluate the quality of care 
    provided to beneficiaries of Medicaid and the Children's Health 
   Insurance Program and to provide incentives for voluntary quality 
                              improvement.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid and Chip Quality 
Improvement Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Despite the fact that Federal and State governments 
        spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year on care for 
        Americans through the Medicaid and CHIP programs, there is no 
        nationwide, systematic method of reporting, collecting, 
        evaluating, or improving the quality of care across all payment 
        and delivery systems (fee-for-service, managed care, primary 
        care case management, or other mechanisms).
            (2) Although the quality of care delivered through Medicaid 
        health plans is frequently measured, there is no method or 
        mechanism to systematically improve the quality of care 
        provided to all Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries.
            (3) For the majority of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees who are 
        served by primary care case management or fee-for-service 
        arrangements, there are no Federal requirements for comparable 
        quality monitoring or improvement. Thus there currently is no 
        ability to make fair assessments across all modes of care for 
        Medicaid and CHIP enrollees.
            (4) State flexibility and the resulting opportunities for 
        innovation are hallmarks of the partnership between Federal and 
        State governments in the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Without a 
        way to systematically measure quality, however, policymakers 
        cannot know which innovations are the most effective.

SEC. 3. MEASURING AND REPORTING ON COMPARABLE HEALTH CARE QUALITY 
              MEASURES FOR ALL PERSONS ENROLLED IN MEDICAID.

    (a) Quality Assurance Standards.--Section 1932(c)(1)(A) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396u-2(c)(1)(A)) is amended by 
inserting ``or comparable primary care case management services 
providers described in section 1905(t) as well as health care services 
furnished in fee-for-service settings or other delivery systems'' after 
``1903(m)''.
    (b) Adult Health Quality Measures.--Section 1139B of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-9b) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as

                following:
            ``(4) Quality reporting for medicaid eligible adults.--

        begins on or after the date that is 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of the Medicaid and Chip Quality Improvement Act of 
        2016, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall require 
        States to use the measures and approaches identified in 
        paragraph (3) to report on the initial core set of quality 
        measures for Medicaid eligible adults identified in paragraph 
        (2), subject to revisions made in accordance with paragraph 
        (6)(B). Such reporting shall be stratified by delivery system, 
        including managed care organizations under section 1932, 
        benchmark plans under section 1937, primary care case 
        management services providers described in section 1905(t),

        delivery systems, except that the Secretary may determine that 
        reporting on certain measures should not be stratified by 
        delivery system because such stratification would not be 
        feasible or the delivery systems are not comparable with 
        respect to the application of such measures. In addition to the 
        stratification required under the previous sentence, the 
        Secretary shall have the discretion to further stratify 
        reporting on certain measures based on factors such as 
        eligibility category, income level, or other differentiating 
        factors that could have an impact on the comparability of the 
        measure.''; and
            (2) in subsection (d)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``under the 
                such plan'' and all that follows through ``subsection 
                (a)(5)'' and inserting ``under such plan or waiver, 
                including measures described in subsection (b)(2), 
                subject to revisions made in accordance with subsection 
                (b)(6)(B)'';
                    (B) in paragraph (1)(B), by inserting ``, or 
                comparable primary care case management services 
                providers described in section 1905(t), as well as 
                health care services furnished in fee-for-service

                1937''; and
                    (C) in paragraph (2), by inserting before the 
                period the following: ``, including analysis of

                adults who receive their health services through 
                managed care, primary care case management, and fee-
                for-service settings or other delivery systems''.
    (c) Pediatric Health Care Measures.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1139A of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 1320b-9a) is amended--
                    (A) in subsection (a)--
                            (i) by redesignating paragraphs (5) through 
                        (8) as paragraphs (6) through (9),

        paragraph (4) to report on the initial core child health care 
        quality measures established under this subsection and as such 
        measures subsequently are updated under subsection (b)(5). Such 
        reporting shall be stratified by delivery system, including

        systems, except that the Secretary may determine that reporting 
        on certain measures should not be stratified by delivery system

        application of such measures. In addition to the stratification 
        required under the previous sentence, the Secretary shall have 
        the discretion to further stratify reporting on certain
