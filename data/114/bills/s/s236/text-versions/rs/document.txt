                not more than 30 hours, which shall be divided equally 
                between the majority and minority leaders or their 
                designees. A motion to further limit debate is in order 
                and not debatable. A motion to postpone, a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
                motion to commit the joint resolution is not in order.

                and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the 
                debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the 
                Senate. A joint resolution shall only agreed to in the 
                Senate upon an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
                Members, duly chose and sworn.
                    ``(C) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure 
                relating to a joint resolution shall be decided without

                not be referred to a committee;
                    ``(B) with respect to the joint resolution of the 
                House receiving the resolution, the procedure in that 
                House shall be the same as if no joint resolution had 
                been received from the other House; and
                    ``(C) with respect to the joint resolution received 
                from the other House (without regard to whether a joint 
                resolution of the receiving House has been introduced 
                or considered in the receiving House)--
                            ``(i) it shall be in order to move to 
                        proceed to the joint resolution of the other 
                        House in accordance with subsection (d)(2) or 
                        (e)(2), as applicable;
                            ``(ii) if the motion to proceed to the 
                        joint resolution of the other House is agreed 
                        to, the joint resolution shall remain the 
                        unfinished business of that House until 
                        disposed of and shall be considered in 
                        accordance with subsection (d) or (e), as 
                        applicable.
            ``(2) Consideration of veto messages.--If the President 
        vetoes the joint resolution, debate on a veto message in the 
        Senate under this section shall be 1 hour equally divided
