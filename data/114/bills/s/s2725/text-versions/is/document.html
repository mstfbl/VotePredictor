                                 A BILL


 
 To impose sanctions with respect to the ballistic missile program of 
                     Iran, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iran Ballistic Missile Sanctions Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On April 2, 2015, President Barack Obama said, ``Other 
        American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its 
        human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will 
        continue to be fully enforced.''.
            (2) On July 7, 2015, General Martin Dempsey, then-Chairman 
        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ``Under no circumstances 
        should we relieve the pressure on Iran relative to ballistic 
        missile capabilities.''.
            (3) On July 29, 2015, in his role as the top military 
        officer in the United States and advisor to the President, 
        General Dempsey confirmed that his military recommendation was 
        that sanctions relating to the ballistic missile program of 
        Iran not be lifted.
            (4) The Government of Iran and Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
        Corps have been responsible for the repeated testing of illegal 
        ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear device, 
        including observed tests in October and November 2015 and March 
        2016, violating United Nations Security Council resolutions.
            (5) On October 14, 2015, Samantha Power, United States 
        Ambassador to the United Nations, said, ``One of the really 
        important features in implementation of the recent Iran deal to 
        dismantle Iran's nuclear program is going to have to be 
        enforcement of the resolutions and the standards that remain on 
        the books.''.
            (6) On December 11, 2015, the United Nations Panel of 
        Experts concluded that the missile launch on October 10, 2015, 
        ``was a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security Council 
        resolution 1929 (2010)''.
            (7) On January 17, 2016, Adam Szubin, Acting Under 
        Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stated, 
        ``Iran's ballistic missile program poses a significant threat 
        to regional and global security, and it will continue to be 
        subject to international sanctions. We have consistently made 
        clear that the United States will vigorously press sanctions 
        against Iranian activities outside of the Joint Comprehensive 
        Plan of Action--including those related to Iran's support for 
        terrorism, regional destabilization, human rights abuses, and 
        ballistic missile program.''.
            (8) On February 9, 2016, James Clapper, Director of 
        National Intelligence, testified that, ``We judge that Tehran 
        would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of 
        delivering nuclear weapons, if it builds them. Iran's ballistic 
        missiles are inherently capable of delivering WMD, and Tehran 
        already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the 
        Middle East. Iran's progress on space launch vehicles--along 
        with its desire to deter the United States and its allies--
        provides Tehran with the means and motivation to develop 
        longer-range missiles, including ICBMs.''.
            (9) On March 9, 2016, Iran reportedly fired two Qadr 
        ballistic missiles with a range of more than 1,000 miles and 
        according to public reports, the missiles were marked with a 
        statement in Hebrew reading, ``Israel must be wiped off the 
        arena of time.''.
            (10) On March 11, 2016, Ambassador Power called the recent 
        ballistic missile launches by Iran ``provocative and 
        destabilizing'' and called on the international community to 
        ``degrade Iran's missile program''.
            (11) On March 14, 2016, Ambassador Power said that the 
        recent ballistic missile launches by Iran were ``in defiance of 
        provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 2231''.
            (12) Iran has demonstrated the ability to launch multiple 
        rockets from fortified underground facilities and mobile launch 
        sites not previously known.
            (13) The ongoing procurement by Iran of technologies needed 
        to boost the range, accuracy, and payloads of its diverse 
        ballistic missile arsenal represents a threat to deployed 
        personnel of the United States and allies of the United States 
        in Europe and the Middle East, including Israel.
            (14) Ashton Carter, Secretary of Defense, testified in a 
        hearing before the Armed Services Committee of the Senate on 
        July 7, 2015, that, ``[T]he reason that we want to stop Iran 
        from having an ICBM program is that the I in ICBM stands for 
        intercontinental, which means having the capability to fly from 
        Iran to the United States, and we don't want that. That's why 
        we oppose ICBMs.''.
            (15) Through recent ballistic missile launch tests the 
        Government of Iran has shown blatant disregard for 
        international laws and its intention to continue tests of that 
        nature throughout the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive 
        Plan of Action.
            (16) The banking sector of Iran has facilitated the 
        financing of the ballistic missile programs in Iran and 
        evidence has not been provided that entities in that sector 
        have ceased facilitating the financing of those programs.
            (17) Iran has been able to amass a large arsenal of 
        ballistic missiles through its illicit smuggling networks and 
        domestic manufacturing capabilities that have been supported 
        and maintained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and specific 
        sectors of the economy of Iran.
            (18) Penetration by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps into 
        the economy of Iran is well documented including investments in 
        the construction, automotive, telecommunications, electronics, 
        mining, metallurgy, and petrochemical sectors of the economy of 
        Iran.
            (19) Items procured through sectors of Iran specified in 
        paragraph (18) have dual use applications that are currently 
        being used to create ballistic missiles in Iran and will 
        continue to be a source of materials for the creation of future 
        weapons.
            (20) In order to curb future illicit activity by Iran, the 
        Government of the United States and the international community 
        must take action against persons that facilitate and profit 
        from the illegal acquisition of ballistic missile parts and 
        technology in support of the missile programs of Iran.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the ballistic missile program of Iran represents a 
        serious threat to allies of the United States in the Middle 
        East and Europe, members of the Armed Forces deployed in the 
        those regions, and ultimately the United States;
            (2) the testing and production by Iran of ballistic 
        missiles capable of carrying a nuclear device is a clear 
        violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 
        (2015), which was unanimously adopted by the international 
        community;
            (3) Iran is using its space launch program to develop the 
        capabilities necessary to deploy an intercontinental ballistic 
        missile that could threaten the United States, and the Director 
        of National Intelligence has assessed that Iran would use 
        ballistic missiles as its ``preferred method of delivering 
        nuclear weapons''; and
            (4) the Government of the United States should impose tough 
        primary and secondary sanctions against any sector of the 
        economy of Iran or any Iranian person that directly or 
        indirectly supports the ballistic missile program of Iran as 
        well as any foreign person or financial institution that 
        engages in transactions or trade that support that program.
