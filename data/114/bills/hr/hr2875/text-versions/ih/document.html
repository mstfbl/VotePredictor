            (1) Initial analysis.--The Attorney General shall perform

        and tribal accreditation organizations.
            (2) In general.--The Attorney General shall recommend 
        additional areas for the development of national standards for 
        the accreditation of law enforcement agencies in consultation 
        with existing law enforcement accreditation organizations,

        community-based organizations, and professional civilian 
        oversight organizations.
            (3) Development of uniform standards.--After completion of 
        the initial review and analysis under paragraph (2), the 
        Attorney General shall recommend, in consultation with such 
        organizations, the adoption of additional standards that will 
        result in greater community accountability of law enforcement

        organizations, and professional civilian oversight 
        organizations to continue the development of further 
        accreditation standards consistent with paragraph (2) and to 
        encourage the pursuit of accreditation of Federal, State, 
        local, and tribal law enforcement agencies by certified law 
        enforcement accreditation organizations.
    (b) Accreditation Grants.--The Attorney General may make funds

            (3) Data collection.--After completion of the initial

        investigatory issues, the Attorney General shall gather 
        additional data nationwide on similar rules from a
