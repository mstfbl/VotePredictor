SEC. 2. EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN WILDERNESS AREAS MANAGED BY THE FOREST 
              SERVICE AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT.

    Section 4(c) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(c)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(c)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(2)(A) In order to ensure adequate response to emergencies 
described in paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may not adopt, 
amend, or enforce any regulation, policy, practice, or guidance that 
would delay Federal, State, or local emergency response personnel from 
entering a wilderness area or wilderness study area in response to an 
emergency. Any entrance by Federal, State, or local emergency response 
personnel into a wilderness area or wilderness study area in response 
to an emergency shall be reported to the Secretary concerned within 24 
hours from the time at which the emergency response personnel first 
entered the area. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as 
barring motorized vehicles, motorized equipment or motorboats, 
aircraft, or other forms of mechanical transport from a wilderness area 
or wilderness study area when employed by Federal, State, or local 
emergency response personnel in response to an emergency.
    ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `Secretary concerned' means--
            ``(i) with respect to wilderness areas and wilderness study 
        areas under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, the 
        Secretary of Agriculture; and
            ``(ii) with respect to wilderness areas and wilderness 
        study areas under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land 
        Management, the Secretary of the Interior.''.
                                 <all>
