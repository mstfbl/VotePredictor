To provide for the comprehensive approach to eradication of the heroin 
    epidemic, to develop the best practices in law enforcement and 
 prescription medication prescribing practices, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop the Overdose Problem Already 
Becoming a Universal Substance Epidemic Act of 2015'' or the ``STOP 
ABUSE Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Prevention and intervention are the best investment.
            (2) According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Usage and 
        Health, the percent of New Hampshire residents 12 and older 
        reporting ever having used heroin has doubled since 2004, 1.2 
        percent in 2005 and 3.3 percent in 2011.
            (3) The number of patients in New Hampshire admitted to 
        State-funded treatment programs for heroin reached 1,540 in 
        2013, a major increase from the 805 reported in 2004.
            (4) Prescription opioid users admitted rose from 213 in 
        2004 to 1,297 in 2013.
            (5) Drug poisoning (more commonly called overdose) is the 
        number one cause of injury-related death in the United States 
        and deaths involving heroin have been on a steady increase in 
        recent years.
            (6) In 2012, 28 States reported that the death rate for 
        heroin overdose had doubled from 2010 through 2012.
            (7) The increase doubled from 1.2 percent to 2.1 percent 
        per 100,000 population, reflecting the number of deaths having 
        increased from 1,779 to 3,635.
            (8) The number of drug-poisoning deaths involving heroin 
        was nearly four times higher for men (6,525 deaths) than women 
        (1,732 deaths) in 2013.
            (9) The rate of heroin-related overdoses was highest among 
        adults aged 25 to 44 from 2000 through 2013; this is a 2.8-
        percent increase from 1.9 to 5.4.
            (10) In 2013, the Midwest and Northeast regions had higher 
        rates (4.3 and 3.9 per 100,000, respectively). From 2000 
        through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for heroin-related drug-
        poisoning deaths increased in the Midwest region exponentially 
        (from 0.4 to 4.3 per 100,000), increased more than 4-fold in 
        the Northeast region (from 0.9 to 3.9), increased more than 3-
        fold in the South region (from 0.5 to 1.7), and doubled in the 
        West region (from 0.9 to 1.8).
            (11) The greatest increase for drug-poisoning rates was 
        seen in the Midwest region.
