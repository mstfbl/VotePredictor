        (d)(2) during the 5-year period beginning on January 1 of the

        be commenced pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 
        804(b)(3), as the case may be, or such other period as the 
        parties may agree. The parties to each proceeding shall bear

        entities performing sound recordings affected by this paragraph 
        during the 5-year period specified in subparagraph (A), or such 
        other period as the parties may agree. Such rates and terms 
        shall distinguish among the different types of services then in 
        operation and shall include a minimum fee for each such type of 
        service, such differences to be based on criteria including the 
        quantity and nature of the use of sound recordings and the 
        degree to which use of the service may substitute for or may 
        promote the purchase of phonorecords by consumers. The 
        Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates and terms that 
        most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been 
        negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a 
        willing seller. In determining such rates and terms, the 
        Copyright Royalty Judges--
                    ``(i) shall base their decision on economic, 
                competitive, and programming information presented by

                        substitute for or may promote the sales of 
                        phonorecords or otherwise may interfere with or 
                        may enhance the sound recording copyright 
                        owner's other streams of revenue from the 
                        copyright owner's sound recordings; and
                            ``(II) the relative roles of the copyright 
                        owner and the transmitting entity in the 
                        copyrighted work and the service made available 
                        to the public with respect to relative creative 
                        contribution, technological contribution, 
                        capital investment, cost, and risk; and
                    ``(ii) may consider the rates and terms for 
                comparable types of audio transmission services and 
                comparable circumstances under voluntary license 
                agreements.
            ``(C) The procedures under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall 
        also be initiated pursuant to a petition filed by any copyright 
        owner of sound recordings or any transmitting entity indicating 
        that a new type of service on which sound recordings are 
        performed is or is about to become operational, for the purpose 
        of determining reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments 
        with respect to such new type of service for the period 
        beginning with the inception of such new type of service and 
        ending on the date on which the royalty rates and terms for 
        eligible nonsubscription services and new subscription 
        services, or preexisting services, as the case may be, most 
        recently determined under subparagraph (A) or (B) and chapter 8 
        expire, or such other period as the parties may agree.''; and

                statutory licensing under subsection (d)(2) if the 
                sound recording had been first fixed on or after

        Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(i) No Adverse Effect on License Fees for Underlying Musical 
Works; Necessity for Other Licenses.--
            ``(1) No adverse effect on license fees for underlying 
        musical works.--License fees payable for the public performance 
        of sound recordings under section 106(6) shall not be cited, 
        taken into account, or otherwise used in any administrative, 
        judicial, or other governmental forum or proceeding, or 
        otherwise, to set or adjust the license fees payable to 
        copyright owners of musical works or their representatives for 
        the public performance of their works, for the purpose of 
        reducing or adversely affecting such license fees. License fees 
        payable to copyright owners for the public performance of their 
        musical works shall not be reduced or adversely affected in any 
        respect as a result of the rights granted by section 106(6).
            ``(2) Necessity for other licenses.--Notwithstanding the 
        grant by an owner of copyright in a sound recording of an 
        exclusive or nonexclusive license of the right under section 
        106(6) to perform the work publicly, a licensee of that sound 
        recording may not publicly perform such sound recording unless 
        a license has been granted for the public performance of any 
        copyrighted musical work contained in the sound recording. Such 
        license to publicly perform the copyrighted musical work may be 
        granted either by a performing rights society representing the 
        copyright owner or by the copyright owner.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 114(d)(3)(C) of title 
        17, United States Code, is hereby repealed.
    (b) Public Performance Rights and Royalties.--Nothing in this Act, 
or the amendments made by this Act, shall adversely affect in any 
respect the public performance rights of or royalties payable to 
songwriters or copyright owners of musical works.
    (c) Preservation of Royalties on Underlying Works Publicly 
Performed by Terrestrial Broadcast Stations.--Section 114(f) of title 
17, United States Code, as amended by section 4(a), is further amended 
by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, 
        under no circumstances shall the rates established by the 
        Copyright Royalty Judges for the public performance of sound 
        recordings be cited, taken into account, or otherwise used in 
        any administrative, judicial, or other governmental forum or 
        proceeding, or otherwise, to reduce or adversely affect the 
        license fees payable to copyright owners of musical works or 
        their representatives for the public performance of their works 
        by terrestrial broadcast stations, and such license fees for 
        the public performance of musical works shall be independent of 
        license fees paid for the public performance of sound 
        recordings.''.

SEC. 9. ALLOCATION OF PAYMENTS TO MUSIC PRODUCERS.

Code, as amended by section 6, is further amended by adding at the end

        Copyright Royalty Judges to distribute receipts from the 
        licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) 
        shall adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides, in 
        circumstances determined by the collective to be appropriate, 
        for acceptance of instructions from a payee identified in 
        subparagraph (A) or (D) of paragraph (2) to distribute a 
        portion of the payments to which the payee otherwise would be 
        entitled from the licensing of transmissions of a particular 
        sound recording to a producer, mixer, or sound engineer who was 
        part of the creative process that created the sound recording 
        (in this section, referred to as a `letter of direction'). To 
        the extent that the collective accepts a letter of direction, 
        the person entitled to payment pursuant to such letter of 
        direction shall, during the time such letter of direction is in 
        effect and followed by the collective, be treated for all 
        purposes as the owner of the right to receive such payment. 
        This paragraph shall not be interpreted to imply that a 
        collective cannot accept or act upon payment instructions in 
        other circumstances.''.
    (b) Additional Provisions for Recordings Fixed Before November 1, 
1995.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code, as amended by

                recording fixed before November 1, 1995, from receipts 
                otherwise payable to the recording artist or artists 
                featured on such sound recording (or the persons
