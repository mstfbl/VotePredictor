SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Americans recognize the importance of savings to create 
        a more secure financial future for their family but barriers to 
        entry have blocked participation in savings programs, leading 
        to drastic disparities in asset building and wealth creation.
            (2) Most working families in America lack savings and face 
        financial insecurity as a result. Forty-four percent of 
        families are ``liquid asset poor'', meaning they lack 
        accessible savings to survive for three months at the Federal 
        poverty level.
            (3) Of that number, over two-thirds of African-Americans 
        (67 percent) could be considered ``liquid asset poor'' as are 
        nearly three-fourths of Latinos (71 percent).
            (4) Families with children face additional barriers to 
        building savings. These families are more likely than childless 
        households to live in asset poverty.
            (5) There is a strong link between savings and economic 
        opportunity. Children in the poorest fifth of households who 
        manage to move up the income ladder as adults have almost ten 
        times the wealth of those who remain at the bottom.
            (6) Children's savings accounts programs are evidence-based 
        and have been tested throughout the country. In 2003, the 
        Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment (SEED) 
        national demonstration project was established to evaluate the 
        policy and practice of savings accounts for children. SEED 
        found that even very low-income parents will save and invest 
        for their children's future if given the opportunity.
            (7) In 2011, the city of San Francisco began offering child 
        savings accounts, expanding them to all children enrolled in 
        public kindergarten starting in 2013. Their experiment proves 
        what SEED documented in 2003--very low-income parents will save 
        and invest for their children's future if given the 
        opportunity.
            (8) Data from San Francisco's nascent Kindergarten to 
        College Account program demonstrates that families, even those 
        of lower income, are contributing their own funds towards their 
        child's education at a rate of four times higher than Americans 
        of all income limits are towards tax advantaged 529 college 
        savings plans.
            (9) Even a small amount of children's savings can have a 
        significant impact on college success, a key driver of economic 
        mobility. Low- and moderate-income children with less than $500 
        saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in 
        college and four times more likely to graduate than children 
        with no savings.
            (10) In the 4 years that the San Francisco Pilot program 
        has been in existence, families have deposited over $1 million 
        in new savings, helping to build assets for participating 
        families.
            (11) In order to expand economic opportunity and spur 
        economic growth, the United States should promote savings and 
        investments for all Americans.

SEC. 3. USACCOUNT FUND.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the 
United States a fund to be known as the ``USAccount Fund''.
    (b) Amounts Held by Fund.--The USAccount Fund consists of the sum 
of all amounts paid into the Fund under this Act, increased by the

reduced by the total amount of payments made from the Fund (including 
payments for administrative expenses).
    (c) Use of Fund.--
            (1) In general.--The sums in the USAccount Fund are 
        appropriated and shall remain available without fiscal year

                8(c)(2).
            (2) Exclusive purposes.--The sums in the USAccount Fund 
        shall not be appropriated for any purpose other than the 
        purposes specified in this section and may not be used for any 
        other purpose.

transfers from the general fund of the Treasury to the USAccount Fund

        certification under section 4(b)(2) with respect to an 
        individual, the Secretary shall transfer $500 to the USAccount 
        of the individual.
            (2) Matching contributions.--Upon receipt of each 
        certification under section 4(d) with respect to an individual, 
        the Secretary shall transfer the matching amount to the 
        USAccount of the individual.
    (e) Private Contributions.--The Executive Director shall pay into 
the USAccount Fund such amounts as are contributed under section 4(c).
    (f) Prohibition on Use of Payroll Taxes To Fund USAccounts.--The

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Executive Director shall establish 
        in the USAccount Fund an account (to be known as a 
        ``USAccount'') for each qualifying account holder certified 
        under subsection (b). Each such account shall be identified to 
        its account holder by means of a unique personal identifier 
        currently recognized by the Internal Revenue Service and shall 
        remain in the USAccount Fund unless transferred to private 
        management under subsection (g).
            (2) Account balance.--The balance in an account holder's 
        USAccount at any time is the excess of--
                    (A) the sum of--
                            (i) all deposits made into the USAccount 
                        Fund and credited to the account under 
                        paragraph (3), and
                            (ii) the total amount of allocations made 
                        to and reductions made in the account pursuant 
                        to paragraph (4), over
                    (B) the amounts paid out of the account with

            (3) Crediting of contributions.--Pursuant to regulations 
        which shall be prescribed by the Executive Director, the

        attributable to the account holder of such account.
            (4) Allocation of earnings and losses.--The Executive 
        Director shall allocate to each USAccount an amount equal to 
        the net earnings and net losses from each investment of sums in

                another person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
                the Secretary that the manner in which that person will 
                administer the USAccount will be consistent with the 
                requirements of this Act or who has so demonstrated 
                with respect to any USAccount,
