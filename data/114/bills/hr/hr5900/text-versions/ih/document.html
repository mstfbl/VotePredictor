United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Portable Fuel Container Safety Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS TO PROTECT AGAINST PORTABLE FUEL 
              CONTAINER EXPLOSIONS NEAR OPEN FLAMES OR OTHER IGNITION 
              SOURCES.

    (a) Rule on Safety Performance Specifications Required.--The 
Consumer Product Safety Commission shall promulgate a final rule 
relating to flame mitigation devices in portable fuel containers for 
flammable liquid fuels that sufficiently reduces the risk of injuries 
associated with the tendency of vapors igniting when the container is 
near an open flame or other ignition source.
    (b) Rulemaking; Consumer Product Safety Standard.--A rule under 
subsection (a)--
            (1) shall be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of 
        title 5, United States Code; and
            (2) shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule 
        promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act 
        (15 U.S.C. 2058).
    (c) Future Rulemaking.--The Commission, at any time after 
publication of the consumer product safety rule required by subsection 
(a) may initiate a rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 
5, United States Code, to modify the requirements or to include any 
additional provision that the Commission determines is reasonably 
necessary to protect public health or safety. Any rule promulgated 
under this subsection shall be treated as a consumer product safety 
rule promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 
U.S.C. 2058).
    (d) Report Required.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to Congress a 
summary of actions taken by the Commission to educate consumers about 
the dangers involved in pouring flammable liquids on or near an 
ignition source.
    (e) Portable Fuel Container Defined.--In this section, the term 
``portable fuel container'' means a receptacle for flammable liquids, 
including any spout, retrofit spout, cap and other closure mechanism 
and component of such receptacle, that foreseeably will be used by 
consumers and is manufactured or imported for use in the United States.
    (f) Rule of Construction.--This section may not be interpreted to 
conflict with the Children's Gasoline Burn Prevention Act (Public Law 
110-278; 122 Stat. 2602).
