                                 A BILL


 
   To protect certain seamounts, ridges, and banks in the Exclusive 
 Economic Zone off the coast of California by the establishment of the 
California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine Conservation Area, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``California Seamounts and Ridges 
National Marine Conservation Area Designation and Management Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine 
        Conservation Area established by this Act contains a series of 
        ancient volcanos and underwater geological features in the 
        Exclusive Economic Zone.
            (2) Found on the seamounts, ridges, and banks in the 
        Conservation Area are rare deep-water corals, sponges, 
        anemones, tunas, sharks, seabirds, marine mammals (including 
        orcas, sperm whales, and blue whales), endangered sea turtles, 
        octopuses, and diverse fish populations, some of which are 
        endemic to the area.
            (3) The only hydrothermal vents in the continental 
        Exclusive Economic Zone are found on Gorda Ridge located off 
        the north coast of California and the south coast of Oregon.
            (4) These areas' remote location and depth contribute to 
        their remarkably pristine condition, limited human footprint, 
        and reputation as a vital frontier for scientific discovery, 
        with research expeditions continuing to yield new and rare 
        species, greater understanding about ecological relationships, 
        and renewed appreciation of the uniqueness of deep-sea 
        ecosystems.
            (5) Despite currently limited direct pressure from 
        extractive use, the Conservation Area is undergoing rapid 
        change due to warming waters, ocean acidification, and 
        ecological stress from pollution and other sources the 
        management of which transcends the jurisdiction of any single 
        government agency or department.
            (6) According to many scientists, comprehensive marine 
        habitat protection is one of the most important actions for 
        building resilience in ocean environments to current and 
        emerging challenges presented by anthropogenic and other 
        stressors impacting marine ecosystems.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect, conserve, and 
enhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations 
the nationally significant historical, natural, cultural, scientific, 
and educational values of the California Seamounts and Ridges National 
Marine Conservation Area.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

        Zone'' means the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States

        means the California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine 
        Conservation Area established by section 4(a).
