                                 A BILL


 
 To require a study on the public health and environmental impacts of 
the production, transportation, storage, and use of petroleum coke, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Petroleum Coke Transparency and 
Public Health Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the past several years, United States crude oil 
        refineries have grown their coking capacity to accommodate the 
        conversion of heavy crude oils into refined petroleum products.
            (2) As coking capacity has grown, the domestic production 
        of petroleum coke is expected to grow, leading to increases in 
        the storage, transportation, and use of the material.
            (3) In Detroit, piles of petroleum coke have been stored in 
        the open air on the banks of the Detroit River.
            (4) Uncovered piles of petroleum coke have also been stored 
        in Southeast Chicago near homes and local baseball fields.
            (5) State regulators, communities, and industry 
        stakeholders would benefit from a complete understanding of 
        petroleum coke and the potential impact on public health and 
        the environment related to the production, transportation, 
        storage, and use of petroleum coke.

SEC. 3. STUDY OF PETROLEUM COKE PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
              IMPACTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in 
consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Energy, 
shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of a study 
concerning petroleum coke that includes the following:
            (1) An analysis of the public health and environmental 
        impacts of the production, transportation, storage, and use of 
        petroleum coke.
            (2) An assessment of potential approaches and best 
        practices for storing, transporting, and managing petroleum 
        coke.
            (3) A quantitative analysis of current and projected 
        domestic petroleum coke production and utilization locations.
    (b) Best Available Science.--The study under subsection (a) shall 
be carried out using the best available science, including readily 
available information from appropriate State agencies, nonprofit 
entities, academic entities, and industry.
    (c) Publication of Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall publish on the Internet website of the Department of Health and 
Human Services the report described in subsection (a).

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF STANDARDS.

    Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, shall promulgate 
rules concerning the storage and transportation of petroleum coke that 
ensure the protection of public and ecological health based upon the 
findings of the study conducted under section 3.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
