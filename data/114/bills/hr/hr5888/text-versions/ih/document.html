                pursuant to section 286(m) of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1356(m)) to recover the full 
                costs of providing adjudication services, the Secretary 
                of Homeland Security shall charge an annual 
                supplemental fee of $150 per temporary worker to each 
                prospective employer who is issued a permit under 
                subsection (d) of this section during the transition 
                program. Such supplemental fee shall be paid into the 
                Treasury of the Commonwealth government for the purpose 
                of funding ongoing vocational educational curricula and 
                program development by Commonwealth educational 
                entities.

                of the supplemental fee into the Treasury of the 
                Commonwealth government in that fiscal year, the 
                Commonwealth government must provide to the Secretary 
                of Labor, a plan for the expenditure of funds received 
                under this paragraph, a projection of the effectiveness 
                of these expenditures in the placement of United States 
                workers into jobs, and a report on the changes in 
                employment of United States workers attributable to 
                prior year expenditures.

                government in its annual plan for the expenditure of 
                funds.'';

                        allocation of permits for such workers on an 
                        annual basis to zero unless the Secretary 
                        determines that a reduction in the number of 
                        available workers for a fiscal year would 
                        adversely affect the Commonwealth's economy. 
                        Such a determination shall be based upon 
                        verifiable documentation of the economic harm

        and anticipated labor needs of the Commonwealth and determine 
        whether an extension of up to 5 years of the provisions of this 
        subsection is necessary to ensure an adequate number of workers 
        will be available for legitimate businesses in the 
        Commonwealth. If the Secretary of Labor determines that such an 
        extension is necessary, the Secretary of Labor shall provide
