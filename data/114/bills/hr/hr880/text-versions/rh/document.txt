is amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of section 38, the research credit 
determined under this section for the taxable year shall be an amount 
equal to the sum of--
            ``(1) 20 percent of so much of the qualified research 
        expenses for the taxable year as exceeds 50 percent of the 
        average qualified research expenses for the 3 taxable years 
        preceding the taxable year for which the credit is being 
        determined,
            ``(2) 20 percent of so much of the basic research payments 
        for the taxable year as exceeds 50 percent of the average basic 
        research payments for the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable 
        year for which the credit is being determined, plus
            ``(3) 20 percent of the amounts paid or incurred by the 
        taxpayer in carrying on any trade or business of the taxpayer 
        during the taxable year (including as contributions) to an 
        energy research consortium for energy research.''.
    (b) Repeal of Termination.--Section 41 of such Code is amended by 
striking subsection (h).
    (c) Credit Allowed Against Alternative Minimum Tax in Case of 
Eligible Small Business.--Section 38(c)(4)(B) of such Code is amended 
by redesignating clauses (ii) through (ix) as clauses (iii) through 
(x), respectively, and by inserting after clause (i) the following new 
clause:
                            ``(ii) the credit determined under section 
                        41 for the taxable year with respect to an 
                        eligible small business (as defined in 
                        paragraph (5)(C), after application of rules 
                        similar to the rules of paragraph (5)(D)),''.
    (d) Conforming Amendments.--
            (1) Section 41(c) of such Code is amended to read as 
        follows:
    ``(c) Determination of Average Research Expenses for Prior Years.--
            ``(1) Special rule in case of no qualified research 
        expenditures in any of 3 preceding taxable years.--In any case 
        in which the taxpayer has no qualified research expenses in any 
        one of the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year for which 
        the credit is being determined, the amount determined under 
        subsection (a)(1) for such taxable year shall be equal to 10 
        percent of the qualified research expenses for the taxable 
        year.
            ``(2) Consistent treatment of expenses.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding whether the 
                period for filing a claim for credit or refund has 
                expired for any taxable year taken into account in 
                determining the average qualified research expenses, or 
                average basic research payments, taken into account 
                under subsection (a), the qualified research expenses 
                and basic research payments taken into account in 
                determining such averages shall be determined on a 
                basis consistent with the determination of qualified 
                research expenses and basic research payments, 
                respectively, for the credit year.
                    ``(B) Prevention of distortions.--The Secretary may 
                prescribe regulations to prevent distortions in 
                calculating a taxpayer's qualified research expenses or 
                basic research payments caused by a change in 
                accounting methods used by such taxpayer between the 
                current year and a year taken into account in 
                determining the average qualified research expenses or 
                average basic research payments taken into account 
                under subsection (a).''.
