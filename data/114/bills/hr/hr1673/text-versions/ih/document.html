        subsection:
    ``(e) Secondary Reserve.--
            ``(1) Establishment.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
        of law, rule, regulation, order, or agreement, the Director 
        shall, by regulation, establish for any enterprise operating in 
        conservatorship pursuant to section 1367 a secondary reserve 
        fund and shall deposit in such fund from any revenues of the 
        enterprise an amount equal to the amounts enumerated under 
        subsection (a) for the enterprise.
            ``(2) Maintenance.--Amounts in the secondary reserve fund 
        shall be held in escrow by the enterprise until--
                    ``(A) the Director uses such amounts pursuant to 
                paragraph (3); or
                    ``(B) the Director abolishes the secondary reserve 
                fund pursuant to paragraph (4).
            ``(3) Availability of amounts.--If the Director determines, 
        in accordance with regulations issued under paragraph (5), that 
        losses of an enterprise operating in conservatorship pursuant 
        to section 1367 will exceed amounts available for the 
        enterprise under subsection (a), (c), (d), or (f), the Director 
        shall make a determination, in accordance with such regulation, 
        whether to use funds held in the secondary reserve for the 
        enterprise.
            ``(4) Abolishment.--Upon the dissolution of the 
        conservatorship of an enterprise, the Director shall abolish 
        any secondary reserve established under paragraph (1) for the 
        enterprise and amounts remaining in such reserve upon such 
        abolishment shall revert to meet capital requirements under 
        subsections (a), (c), (d), and (f) and then to earnings of the 
        enterprise.
            ``(5) Regulations.--The Director shall issue regulations 
        establishing--
                    ``(A) standards and procedures for the 
                establishment of a secondary reserve under paragraph 
                (1);
                    ``(B) standards and procedures that the Director

                reserve under paragraph (4).
            ``(6) Treatment of secondary reserve.--Any secondary 
        reserve established under this Act for an enterprise shall not 
        be considered capital, a capital reserve, or otherwise an asset 
        of the enterprise, other than as part of a capital restoration 
        plan for the enterprise approved under section 1369C, during 
        the pendency of a conservatorship for the enterprise.''.
