            (1) the policy barriers to United States grain producers in 
        countries the grain of which receives official grading in the 
        United States but which do not offer official grading for 
        United States grain or provide only the lowest designation for 
        United States grain, including an analysis of possible 
        inconsistencies with trade obligations; and
            (2) any actions the Executive Branch is taking to remedy

        barriers.
