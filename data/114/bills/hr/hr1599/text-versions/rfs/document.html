following:

``SEC. 424. FOOD DERIVED FROM NEW PLANT VARIETIES.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall continue to administer the 
consultation process established under the Food and Drug 
Administration's policy statement entitled `Statement of Policy: Food 
Derived from New Plant Varieties' published in the Federal Register on 
May 29, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 22,984).
    ``(b) Determination of Material Difference Between Food From 
Genetically Engineered Plants and Comparable Foods.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the use 
        of genetic engineering does not, by itself, constitute 
        information that is material for purposes of determining 
        whether there is a difference between a food produced from, 
        containing, or consisting of a genetically engineered plant and 
        a comparable food.
            ``(2) Labeling required.--The Secretary may require that 
        the labeling of a food produced from, containing, or consisting 
        of a genetically engineered plant contain a statement to 
        adequately inform consumers of a difference between the food so 
        produced and its comparable food if the Secretary determines 
        that--
                    ``(A) there is a material difference in the 
                functional, nutritional, or compositional

                    ``(B) the disclosure of such material difference is 
                necessary to protect public health and safety or to 
                prevent the label or labeling of the food so produced 
                from being false or misleading in any particular.''.
