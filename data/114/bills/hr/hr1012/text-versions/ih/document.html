                                 A BILL


 
    To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve the 
  provision of items and services provided to Medicare beneficiaries 
            residing in rural areas, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``MediFair Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have 
        created barriers to care for seniors and the disabled.
            (2) The regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement 
        penalize States that have cost-effective health care delivery 
        systems and reward those States with high utilization rates and 
        that provide inefficient care.
            (3) Comparatively, in 2007, the average per capita spending 
        under traditional Medicare was $8,682 for beneficiaries in the 
        United States, $7,320 for beneficiaries in Seattle, $11,303 for 
        those in Los Angeles, and $17,274 for those in Miami.
            (4) Over a lifetime, regional inequities can mean as much 
        as a $125,000 difference in the cost of care provided per 
        beneficiary.
            (5) Regional inequities have resulted in creating very 
        different Medicare programs and amount of care received for 
        seniors and the disabled based on where they live.
            (6) Because the Medicare Advantage rate is based on the 
        fee-for-service reimbursement rate, regional inequities have 
        allowed some Medicare beneficiaries access to Medicare 
        Advantage plans with significantly more benefits and reduced 
        cost sharing. Beneficiaries in States with lower Medicare 
        Advantage reimbursement rates have not benefitted to the same 
        degree as beneficiaries in other parts of the country.
            (7) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement have 
        created an unfair competitive advantage for hospitals and other 
        health care providers in States that receive above average 
        payments. Higher payments mean that those providers can pay 
        higher salaries in a tight, competitive market.
            (8) Regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement, if left 
        unchecked, will reduce access to Medicare services and impact 
        healthy outcomes for beneficiaries.

SEC. 3. IMPROVING FAIRNESS OF PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS UNDER THE MEDICARE 
              FEE-FOR-SERVICE PROGRAM.

    Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new section:

``improving payment equity under the original medicare fee-for-service 
                                program

    ``Sec. 1899C.  (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, the Secretary shall establish a system for making adjustments 
to the amount of payment made to entities and individuals for items and 
services provided under the original Medicare fee-for-service program 
under parts A and B.
    ``(b) System Requirements.--
            ``(1) Increase for states below the national average.--
        Under the system established under subsection (a), if a State 
        average per beneficiary amount for a year is less than the 
        national average per beneficiary amount for such year, then the 
        Secretary (beginning in 2017) shall increase the amount of 
        applicable payments in such a manner as will result (as 
        estimated by the Secretary) in the State average per 
        beneficiary amount for the subsequent year being equal to the 
        national average per beneficiary amount for such subsequent 
        year.
            ``(2) Reduction for certain states above the national 
        average to enhance quality care and maintain budget 
        neutrality.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure that 
                the increase in payments under paragraph (1) does not 
                cause the estimated amount of expenditures under this 
                title for a year to increase or decrease from the 
                estimated amount of expenditures under this title that 
                would have been made in such year if this section had 
                not been enacted by reducing the amount of applicable 
                payments in each State that the Secretary determines 
                has--
                            ``(i) a State average per beneficiary 
                        amount for a year that is greater than the 
                        national average per beneficiary amount for 
                        such year; and
                            ``(ii) healthy outcome measurements or 
                        quality care measurements that indicate that a 
                        reduction in applicable payments would 
                        encourage more efficient use of, and reduce 
                        overuse of, items and services for which 
                        payment is made under this title.
                    ``(B) Limitation.--The Secretary shall not reduce 
                applicable payments under subparagraph (A) to a State 
                that--
                            ``(i) has a State average per beneficiary 
                        amount for a year that is greater than the 
                        national average per beneficiary amount for 
                        such year; and
                            ``(ii) has healthy outcome measurements or 
                        quality care measurements that indicate that 
                        the applicable payments are being used to 
                        improve the access of beneficiaries to quality 
                        care.
            ``(3) Determination of averages.--
                    ``(A) State average per beneficiary amount.--Each 
                year (beginning in 2017), the Secretary shall determine 
                a State average per beneficiary amount for each State 
                which shall be equal to the Secretary's estimate of the 
                average amount of expenditures under the original 
                Medicare fee-for-service program under parts A and B 
                for the year for a beneficiary enrolled under such 
                parts that resides in the State.
                    ``(B) National average per beneficiary amount.--
                Each year (beginning in 2017), the Secretary shall 
                determine the national average per beneficiary amount 
                which shall be equal to the average of the State 
                average per beneficiary amount determined under 
                subparagraph (A) for the year.
            ``(4) Definitions.--In this section:
                    ``(A) Applicable payments.--The term `applicable 
                payments' means payments made to entities and 
                individuals for items and services provided under the 
                original Medicare fee-for-service program under parts A 
                and B to beneficiaries enrolled under such parts that 
                reside in the State.
                    ``(B) State.--The term `State' has the meaning 
                given such term in section 210(h).
    ``(c) Beneficiaries Held Harmless.--The provisions of this section 
shall not affect--
            ``(1) the entitlement to items and services of a 
        beneficiary under this title, including the scope of such items 
        and services; or
            ``(2) any liability of the beneficiary with respect to such 
        items and services.
    ``(d) Regulations.--
