SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS.

    Section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2133) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), by inserting ``, including that the 
        facility does not pose an unreasonable threat to persons or the 
        environment because of safety or security vulnerabilities 
        (including vulnerability to terrorist attacks), and that there 
        exist adequate evacuation plans for emergency events and that 
        those plans have been approved by the relevant Federal agencies 
        and States within 50 miles of the facility'' after ``by rule 
        establish''; and
            (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``Any such renewal shall be subject to the same criteria and 
        requirements that would be applicable for an original 
        application for initial construction, and the Commission shall 
        ensure that any changes in the size or distribution of the 
        surrounding population, or seismic or other scientific data not 
        available at time of original licensing, have not resulted in 
        the facility being located at a site at which a new facility 
        would not be allowed to be built.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
