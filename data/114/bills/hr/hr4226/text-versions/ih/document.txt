SECTION 1. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSSES TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED 
              ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY QUARANTINE.

    Section 1501 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (7 U.S.C. 9081) is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(f) Reimbursement for Losses To Comply With Government-Imposed 
Oriental Fruit Fly Quarantine.--
            ``(1) Reimbursement authorized.--The Secretary shall use 
        such sums as are necessary of the funds of the Commodity Credit 
        Corporation to reimburse eligible producers on farms that have 
        incurred losses because of an inability to ship a crop to 
        market, or by being prevented from planting or growing a crop, 
        due to a Federal Government or a State government quarantine to 
        control the Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) imposed 
        during the period beginning on August 15, 2015, and ending on 
        March 31, 2016, or such later date as the Secretary considers 
        necessary.
            ``(2) Payment rate.--Payments to an eligible producer on a 
        farm under paragraph (1) shall be made at a rate not to exceed 
        70 percent of the market value of the affected crop. The market 
        value shall be determined using the average market value of the 
        affected crop in the quarantine area during the preceding five 
        crop years, as determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop 
        year in which such a quarantine was in effect and excluding the 
        crop year in which the market value was highest and the crop 
        year in which the market value was lowest.
            ``(3) Duration.--Payments to an eligible producer on a farm 
        under paragraph (1) shall cease as soon as possible once the 
        eligible producer on a farm is able to resume marketing a crop 
        after the quarantine is lifted.
            ``(4) Crop insurance.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to paragraph (5), in 
                carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall not 
                discriminate against or penalize an eligible producer 
                on a farm that obtained, or did not obtain, crop 
                insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 
                U.S.C. 1501 et seq.), noninsured crop disaster 
                assistance under section 196 of the Federal Agriculture 
                Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7333), or 
                similar risk protection for that same type of crop.
                    ``(B) Requirement to obtain insurance.--As a 
                condition on the receipt of a payment under this 
                subsection for a crop, an eligible producer on a farm 
                shall agree to obtain crop insurance, noninsured crop 
                disaster assistance, or similar risk protection for 
                that same type of crop for at least the next two crop 
                years, if such insurance, assistance, or protection is 
                available.
            ``(5) Effect of other assistance.--The payment that an 
        eligible producer on a farm would otherwise receive under this 
        subsection shall be reduced by the amount of assistance 
        provided to the producer for losses described in paragraph (1) 
        under any other Federal law, including the Federal Crop 
        Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and section 196 of the 
        Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (7 
        U.S.C. 7333).''.
