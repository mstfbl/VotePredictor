        enactment of this Act, consistent with the National Institute 
        of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical 
        Infrastructure Cybersecurity and any update to that document

            (5) request the National Maritime Security Advisory 
        Committee established under section 70112 of title 46, United

        established under section 70112 of title 46, United States 
        Code, to facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity risks and 
        incidents to address port-specific cybersecurity risks, which 
        may include the establishment of a working group of members of 
        Area Maritime Security Advisory Committees to address port-
        specific cybersecurity vulnerabilities; and
            (2) that any area maritime security plan and facility 
        security plan required under section 70103 of title 46, United
