SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since 2006, incidents of murder, other violent crime, 
        and corruption perpetrated by armed criminal gangs and illicit 
        trafficking organizations have risen alarmingly in El Salvador, 
        Guatemala and Honduras (referred to in this Act as the 
        ``Northern Triangle'').
            (2) In 2013, Honduras had the highest per capita homicide 
        rate of any nation in the world, with 90.4 murders for every 
        100,000 people in the country. El Salvador and Guatemala were 
        in the top 5 countries with the highest per capita homicide 
        rates.
            (3) Since 2013, El Salvador's murder rate rose sharply to 
        become the highest of any country in the world in 2015 at 108.5 
        homicides for every 100,000 people, following a dramatic 
        escalation of violence between the country's 2 largest armed 
        criminal gangs, Mara Salvatrucha (commonly known as ``MS-13'') 
        and Barrio 18.
            (4) According to the United Nations International 
        Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the per capita homicide 
        rate for children in El Salvador and Guatemala is higher than 
        any other country in the world. In 2014, 27 out of every 
        100,000 children were murdered in El Salvador.
            (5) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees (UNHCR), Honduras and El Salvador have the highest per 
        capita female homicide rates in the world. In 2014, 90 out of 
        every 100,000 females were murdered in Honduras.
            (6) In April 2016, UNHCR's spokesperson stated, ``The 
        number of people fleeing violence in Central America has surged 
        to levels not seen since the region was wracked by armed 
        conflicts in the 1980s. Action is urgently needed to ensure 
        that unaccompanied children and others receive the protection 
        to which they are entitled.''.
            (7) Since 2013, individuals fleeing the Northern Triangle 
        have sought sanctuary in neighboring countries and there has 
        recently been a 1,185 percent increase in the number of asylum 
        applications from citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, and 
        Honduras to the Governments of Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa 
        Rica and Belize.
            (8) Unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle now 
        make up the majority of unaccompanied minors encountered at the 
        international border between the United States and Mexico, with 
        the fastest increase occurring among children younger than 12 
        years of age.
            (9) Human smugglers are increasingly responsible for the 
        transit of migrants from the Northern Triangle to the United 
        States. According to the Government Accountability Office, 
        human smugglers frequently use aggressive and misleading 
        marketing to recruit migrants.
            (10) Many female migrants face rape and sexual violence 
        during the journey, either from smugglers or others encountered 
        on the route, or risk being trafficked for sex or labor.
            (11) Challenges to the rule of law in the Northern Triangle 
        have been exacerbated by the limited ability and lack of 
        political will on the part of governments to investigate and 
        prosecute those responsible for murder. In 2014, approximately 
        95 percent of murders remained unresolved in Honduras and El 
        Salvador.
            (12) The presence of major drug trafficking organizations 
        in the Northern Triangle contributes to violence, corruption, 
        and criminality. The 2016 International Narcotics Control 
        Strategy Report prepared by the Department of State estimated 
        that ``approximately 90 percent of the cocaine trafficked to 
        the United States in the first half of 2015 first transited 
        through the Mexico/Central America corridor''.
            (13) Widespread public sector corruption in the Northern 
        Triangle undermines economic and social development and 
        directly affects regional political stability, as demonstrated 
        by the indictment and resignation of former Guatemalan 
        president Otto Perez Molina on corruption charges.
            (14) Human rights defenders, journalists, trade unionists, 
        social leaders, and LGBT activists in the Northern Triangle 
        face dire conditions, as evidenced by the March 2016 murder of 
        Honduran activist Berta Caceres and the targeted killing of 
        more than 200 such civil society leaders since 2006. Almost 
        none of these cases have resulted in convictions.
            (15) The Northern Triangle struggles with high levels of 
        economic insecurity. In 2014, more than 62 percent of 
        Hondurans, more than 59 percent of Guatemalans, and more than 
        31 percent of Salvadorans lived below the poverty line.
            (16) Weak investment climates and low levels of educational 
        opportunity are barriers to inclusive economic growth and 
        social development in the Northern Triangle.
            (17) Although the CAM Program has approval rates of nearly 
        98 percent, due to limited resources, of the 8,920 children 
        that have applied for humanitarian protection, only 626 have 
        been conditionally approved and only 368 have entered the 
        United States.
            (18) Approximately 50 percent of unaccompanied minors 
        facing United States immigration proceedings receive legal 
        representation. Children with legal counsel appeared at their 
        hearings more than 95 percent of the time.
            (19) As of May 2016, 492,978 cases were pending before 
        immigration courts, with such cases taking an average of 553 
        days to reach a final decision.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States must address the violence and 
        humanitarian crisis resulting in the elevated numbers of 
        unaccompanied children, women, and refugees from the Northern 
        Triangle arriving at the Southwestern border of the United 
        States;
            (2) the violence and humanitarian crisis has been prompted 
        by the severe challenges posed by--
                    (A) high rates of homicide, sexual violence, and 
                violent crime perpetrated by armed criminal actors;
                    (B) endemic corruption; and
                    (C) the limited ability and the lack of political 
                will on the part of governments to protect their 
                citizens and uphold the rule of law in the Northern 
                Triangle;
            (3) the United States must work with international 
        partners--
                    (A) to address the complicated conditions in the 
                Northern Triangle that contribute to the violence and 
                humanitarian crisis; and
                    (B) to protect vulnerable populations, particularly 
                women and children, fleeing violence in the region;
            (4) the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern 
        Triangle, which was developed by the Governments of El 
        Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, with the technical 
        assistance of the Inter-American Development Bank, represents a 
        comprehensive approach to address the complex situation in the 
        Northern Triangle;
            (5) the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, as 
        articulated by President Obama and Vice President Biden, 
        provides important support for the Alliance for Prosperity and 
        other United States national security priorities, including 
        rule of law and anti-corruption initiatives;
            (6) combating corruption in the Northern Triangle must 
        remain a critical priority and the United Nation's Commission 
        Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and the Organization of 
        American States' Mission to Support the Fight Against 
        Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) are important 
        contributions to this effort;
            (7) the United States must continue to encourage the 
        creation of a similar international commission to combat 
        corruption and impunity in El Salvador;
            (8) the governments of the Northern Triangle are urged to 
        ensure that the Office of the Attorney General in each such 
        country receives sufficient domestic budget allocations to 
        carry out their core responsibilities and that budgeted funds 
        are delivered in a timely manner;
            (9) the United States should work in cooperation with the 
        Government of Mexico in encouraging best practices consistent 
        with international law and obligations regarding the protection 
        of vulnerable populations such as women and children;
            (10) the CAM Program provides a safe, legal, and orderly 
        alternative to children fleeing violence in the Northern 
        Triangle;
            (11) the United States must--
                    (A) expand the CAM Program to ensure the safe and 
                orderly processing of refugee children in the region;
                    (B) strengthen internal asylum systems in Mexico 
                and other countries in the region to protect and 
                process eligible children and families, including 
                establishing and expanding in-country reception 
                centers;
                    (C) expand access to legal representation for 
                unaccompanied alien children facing United States 
                immigration proceedings; and
                    (D) reduce delays in immigration courts, which 
                contribute to misinformation that migrants who come to 
                the United States will not be removed; and
            (12) it is imperative for the United States to sustain a 
        long-term commitment to addressing the factors causing Central 
        Americans to flee their countries by strengthening citizen 
        security, the rule of law, democratic governance, the 
        protection of human rights, and inclusive economic growth in 
        the Northern Triangle.
