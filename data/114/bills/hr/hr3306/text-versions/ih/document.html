                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the export of energy resources, energy technologies, and 
           related services to Cuba, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promote Opportunities With Energy 
Resources for Cuba Act'' or ``POWER Cuba Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cuba produced an estimated 49,000 barrels per day of 
        petroleum and other liquid fuels for production of energy in 
        2014 and consumed 171,000 barrels per day of petroleum and 
        other liquids.
            (2) Cuba imports most of its oil supply from Venezuela, 
        which provides crude oil at a heavily subsidized rate under a 
        2000 energy agreement.
            (3) As of January 2015, Cuba had 124,000,000 barrels of 
        proven crude oil reserves, according to Oil and Gas Journal 
        (OGJ). The prospects of finding oil in the deep waters off the 
        northern coast of Cuba attracted many oil and gas companies 
        from around the world. However, due to geological and 
        technological challenges, offshore deep water exploration 
        activity has so far yielded no results. Exploration in Cuba has 
        now shifted onshore, to areas along Cuba's northern coast.
            (4) Cuba has four refineries, all of which are owned by 
        Cuba Petroleos, the state-owned oil and natural gas company. 
        Total crude oil refining capacity was 301,400 barrels per day 
        in January 2015, according to Oil and Gas Journal.
            (5) In an effort to diversify its energy portfolio, Cuba 
        has set a goal of producing 24 percent of its electricity from 
        renewable sources by 2030. Cuba's current renewable energy 
        output accounts for only 4.3 percent of its total electricity 
        production. To meet this goal, Union Electrica, the state-owned 
        power company, is planning 13 wind projects with a total 
        capacity of 633 megawatts. In addition, Cuba plans to add 755 
        megawatts of biomass-fired capacity, 700 megawatts of solar 
        capacity, and 56 megawatts of hydroelectric power.
            (6) The end of trade restrictions could generate a new 
        market for many types of supplies and services from the United 
        States energy industry.

SEC. 3. OIL AND GAS EXPORTS.

    (a) Energy Policy and Conservation Act.--Section 103 of the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212) is amended by adding at 
the end the following:
    ``(g) This section shall not apply to the export of oil to Cuba.''.
    (b) Natural Gas Act.--Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 
717b) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(g) This section shall not apply to the export of LNG to Cuba.''.

SEC. 4. EXPORT OF ENERGY RESOURCES, ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, AND RELATED 
              SERVICES TO CUBA.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
President is authorized to permit any person subject to the

        described in paragraph (2);
            (4) to conduct any transaction incident to carrying out an 
        activity described in any of paragraphs (1) through (3); and
            (5) to enter into, perform, and make and receive payments 
        under a contract with any individual or entity in Cuba with 
        respect to the provision of energy resources and energy 
        technologies described in paragraph (1) and services described 
        in paragraph (2).
