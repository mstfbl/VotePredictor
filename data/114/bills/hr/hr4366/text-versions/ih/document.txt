SEC. 11. RESTORATION FUND PAYMENTS BY WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT.

    For the purpose of avoiding a shift of Central Valley Project 
Restoration Fund payments from Westlands Water District to Central 
Valley Project preference power contractors, for any year in which the 
allocation of water for south-of-Delta Central Valley Project long-term 
water service contractors or repayment contractors is greater than 75 
percent, the Secretary shall calculate for Westlands Water District a 
per acre foot Restoration Fund payment based on a projection that 
Westlands Water District would take delivery of the allocation made to 
south-of-Delta Central Valley Project long-term water service 
contractors or repayment contractors.
                                 <all>
