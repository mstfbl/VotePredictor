  To establish terms and conditions under which the Secretary of the 
Interior shall convey, for fair market value, certain properties in the

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDING.

    Congress finds that it is in the public interest to eliminate 
expensive and contentious disputes between the Secretary and permittees 
by conveying, for fair market value, certain federally owned land in 
the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, Washington.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish terms and conditions under 
which the Secretary shall convey, for fair market value (less the 
improvements), certain Federal land in the Lake Roosevelt National 
Recreation Area, Washington.

    In this Act:
            (1) Permittee.--The term ``permittee''--
                    (A) means a person who, on the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, holds a valid permit for use of 
                a Property; and
                    (B) includes the permittee's heirs, executors, and 
                assigns of that permittee's interest.

        (including improvements) associated by permit with one of 25 
        private cabins on 26 vacation sites located along Sherman Creek 
        and Rickey Point in the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation 
        Area.
            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of the Interior.

SEC. 4. SALE OF PROPERTIES.

    (a) Timing; Purchaser To Extend Option To Purchase.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall give the permittee of 
        a Property the first option to purchase that Property for fair 
        market value (less the value of all permittee improvements) as 
        determined under subsection (d). The Secretary shall convey the 
        Property as soon as practicable after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, but no later than at the conclusion of the current 
        permit period. If the Secretary fails to convey the property 
        before the lease expires, the Secretary shall authorize permit 
        extensions at no additional cost to the permittee.
            (2) Compensation for improvements.--If a permittee declines 
        to purchase a Property, the Secretary shall offer the Property 
        for sale to the general public at fair market value, as 
        determined under subsection (d). If a person other than the 
        permittee purchases the Property, that person shall compensate 
        the permittee for the fair market value of all private 
        improvements made to the Property, as determined under 
        subsection (d).
            (3) Failure to sell.--If no person submits a bid at or 
        above the fair market value as determined under subsection (d), 
        the property shall remain in Federal ownership.
    (b) In General.--The Secretary--
            (1) shall offer to sell, for fair market value--
                    (A) all right, title, and interest of the United 
                States in and to each Property, subject to valid 
                existing rights; and
                    (B) easements for--
                            (i) vehicular access to such Property;
                            (ii) access to and use of one dock for such 
                        Property; and
                            (iii) access to and use of all boathouses, 
                        ramps, retaining walls, and other improvements 
                        for which access is provided in the permit for 
                        use of such Property on the date of the 
                        enactment of this Act; and
            (2) may sell, for fair market value, Federal land 
        contiguous to each Property, not including shoreline or land 
        needed to provide public access to the shoreline, if the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) determines that such a sale will eliminate 
                inholdings and facilitate administration of adjacent 
                land remaining in Federal ownership after the sale of 
                each Property; and
                    (B) after consultation with the appropriate Indian 
                tribe, determines that such a sale will not adversely 
                affect Indian cultural resources and sacred sites.
    (c) Purchase Process.--The Secretary shall--
            (1) solicit sealed bids for each Property; and
            (2) sell each Property to the bidder who submits the 
        highest bid at or above the fair market value of the Property, 
        as determined under subsection (d).
    (d) Appraisal.--The Secretary shall conduct an appraisal of each 
Property (less the value of all permittee improvements) to determine 
the fair market value of that Property. The appraisal shall--
            (1) be conducted in conformance with the Uniform Standards 
        of Professional Appraisal Practice;
            (2) appraise the value of the Property, including the value 
        of appurtenant easements, exclusive of the value of private 
        improvements made by permittees of the Property before the date 
        of the appraisal; and
            (3) appraise the value of all private improvements made by 
        permittees of the Property before the date of the appraisal.
    (e) Costs.--The cost of a conveyance of a Property under this Act, 
including the cost of required appraisals, shall be paid--
            (1) by the Secretary in the case of a sale to a permittee, 
        from revenues of that sale; and
            (2) by the purchaser in the case of a sale to any person 
        other than the permittee.

SEC. 5. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF LAND.

    Revenues from the sale of Federal land under this Act shall be made 
available to the Secretary, without further appropriation, for costs 
under section 4(e)(1) and for deferred maintenance activities in the 
Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area.
