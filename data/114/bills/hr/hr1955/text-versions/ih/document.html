                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide assistance 
 for nutrient removal technologies to States in the Great Lakes System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Nutrient Removal 
Assistance Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) ineffective wastewater treatment is one of the most 
        common sources of water pollution;
            (2) nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading, 
        continues to be one of the most significant water quality 
        issues facing the Great Lakes System;
            (3) limiting phosphorus loads is key to controlling 
        excessive algal growth, and a coordinated Great Lakes System-
        wide strategy to change how nutrients are discharged is urgent; 
        and
            (4) nutrient removal technology is one of the most 
        reliable, cost effective, and direct methods for reducing the 
        flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point 
        sources in the Great Lakes System.

SEC. 3. NUTRIENT REMOVAL TECHNOLOGY GRANT PROGRAM.

    Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1268) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i) Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program.--
            ``(1) Grant program.--
                    ``(A) Establishment.--Not later than 1 year after 
                the date of enactment of this subsection, the 
                Administrator shall establish a program within the 
                Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to Great 
                Lakes States, and municipalities thereof, to install, 
                at eligible facilities, nutrient removal technologies 
                that are designed to reduce total nutrients in 
                discharged wastewater.
                    ``(B) Priority.--In making a grant under this 
                subsection, the Administrator shall--

                            ``(ii) give priority to eligible facilities 
                        at which the installation of nutrient removal 
                        technologies would--
                                    ``(I) produce the greatest nutrient 
                                load reductions at points of discharge;

                                environmental benefits to the Great 
                                Lakes System; and
                                    ``(III) help meet the objectives 
                                related to nutrients outlined in Annex 
                                4 of the Great Lakes Water Quality

                    ``(C) Application.--A Great Lakes State, or

                installing the nutrient removal technologies at the 
                eligible facility with respect to which the application 
                was submitted.
            ``(2) Definitions.--In this subsection:
