                                 A BILL


 
 To reduce sports-related concussions in youth, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Sports Concussion Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Scientific advancements and a greater understanding of 
        the issues that affect the health and safety of young athletes 
        are key to reducing sports-related concussions in youth.
            (2) The National Academies issued a report in 2013 finding 
        limited evidence that current helmet designs reduce the risk of 
        sports-related concussions and no evidence that mouthguards or 
        facial protection reduce concussion risk, and recommending that 
        the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense 
        fund research on biomechanical factors that influence injury 
        risk in youth.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Consumer Product Safety Commission should review 
        the National Academies' report and future research in this 
        area, including research as recommended by the National 
        Academies, for any matter that may impact products under the 
        Commission's jurisdiction;
            (2) if protective equipment manufacturers choose to adopt 
        voluntary consumer product safety standards, the voluntary 
        standards should include mechanisms to ensure substantial 
        compliance by covered entities; and
            (3) the Federal Trade Commission should review the National 
        Academies' report and future research in this area, including 
        research as recommended by the National Academies, for any 
        matter that may inform efforts to protect consumers from unfair 
        or deceptive practices in or affecting commerce.

SEC. 3. FALSE OR MISLEADING CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO ATHLETIC SPORTING 
              ACTIVITY EQUIPMENT.

    (a) Unlawful Activity.--It is unlawful for any person to sell, or 
offer for sale, in interstate commerce, or import into the United 
States for the purpose of selling or offering for sale, any item or 
equipment intended, designed, or offered for use by an individual 
engaged in any athletic sporting activity, whether professional or 
amateur, for which the seller or importer, or any person acting on 
behalf of the seller or importer, makes any deceptive claim with 
respect to the safety benefits of such item.
    (b) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        subsection (a) shall be treated as a violation of a rule under 
        section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a) 
        regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
            (2) Powers of federal trade commission.--
                    (A) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall 
                enforce this section in the same manner, by the same 
                means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and 
                duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of 
                the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) 
                were incorporated into and made a part of this section.
                    (B) Regulations.--Notwithstanding any other

                Code, such regulations as the Commission considers

                violates subsection (a) shall be subject to the 
                penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities

                all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal
