of 2016''.

SEC. 2. RELIEF PENDING REVIEW.

    Section 705 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``When'' and inserting the following:
    ``(a) In General.--When''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(b) High-Impact Rules.--
            ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--
                    ``(A) the term `Administrator' means the 
                Administrator of the Office of Information and 
                Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and 
                Budget; and
                    ``(B) the term `high-impact rule' means any rule 
                that the Administrator determines may impose an annual 
                cost on the economy of not less than $1,000,000,000.
            ``(2) Identification.--A final rule may not be published or 
        take effect until the agency making the rule submits the rule 
        to the Administrator and the Administrator makes a 
        determination as to whether the rule is a high-impact rule, 
        which shall be published by the agency with the final rule.
            ``(3) Relief.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), an agency shall postpone the 
                effective date of a high-impact rule of the agency 
                until the final disposition of all actions seeking 
                judicial review of the rule.
                    ``(B) Failure to timely seek judicial review.--
                Notwithstanding section 553(d), if no person seeks 
                judicial review of a high-impact rule--
                            ``(i) during any period explicitly provided 
                        for judicial review under the statute 
                        authorizing the making of the rule; or
                            ``(ii) if no such period is explicitly 
                        provided for, during the 60-day period 
                        beginning on the date on which the high-impact 
                        rule is published in the Federal Register,
                the high-impact rule may take effect as early as the 
                date on which the applicable period ends.
            ``(4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
        be construed to impose any limitation under law on any court 
        against the issuance of any order enjoining the implementation 
        of any rule.''.
