        otherwise reduce the portion of the share of the cost of an 
        activity required to be paid by an Indian tribe under such 
        paragraph, if the Secretary determines that the tribe does not 
        have sufficient funds to pay such portion.

this section unless the Secretary determines, in consultation with 
affected coastal States, that the activities to be carried out with the
