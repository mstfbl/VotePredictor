dispersant under section 311(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 1321(d)), and shall withdraw any approval of 
such use made before the date of enactment of this Act, until the date 
on which the rulemaking and study required by subparagraphs (A) and (E) 
of section 311(d)(5) of such Act (as added by this Act) are complete.
    (b) Conditional Approval.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator may approve the use of a 
        dispersant under section 311(d) of such Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(d))

        under section 311(d)(2)(G) of such Act (33 U.S.C. 
        1321(d)(2)(G)) for the period of time before the date on which 
        the rulemaking and study required by subparagraphs (A) and (E) 
        of section 311(d)(5) of such Act (as added by this Act) are 
        complete if the Administrator determines that such use will not 
        have a negative impact on human health, water quality, the 
        environment, or any other factor the Administrator determines 
        appropriate.
            (2) Sunset.--An approval issued under paragraph (1) shall 
        cease to be effective after the last day of the 2-year period 
        beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.

subsection (b), the Administrator may require the manufacturer of the 
dispersant to provide such information as the Administrator determines 
necessary to satisfy the requirements of that subsection.
