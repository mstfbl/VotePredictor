To foster civilian research and development of advanced nuclear energy 
  technologies and enhance the licensing and commercial deployment of 
                           such technologies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Advanced Nuclear Technology 
Development Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nuclear energy generates approximately 20 percent of 
        the total electricity and approximately 60 percent of the 
        carbon-free electricity of the United States.
            (2) Nuclear power plants operate consistently at a 90 
        percent capacity factor, and provide consumers and businesses 
        with reliable and affordable electricity.
            (3) Nuclear power plants generate billions of dollars in 
        national economic activity through nationwide procurements and 
        provide thousands of Americans with high paying jobs 
        contributing substantially to the local economies in 
        communities where they operate.
            (4) The United States commercial nuclear industry must 
        continue to lead the international civilian nuclear 
        marketplace, because it is one of our most powerful national 
        security tools, guaranteeing the safe, secure, and exclusively 
        peaceful use of nuclear energy.
            (5) Maintaining the Nation's nuclear fleet of commercial 
        light water reactors and expanding the use of new advanced 
        reactor designs would support continued production of reliable 
        baseload electricity and maintain United States global 
        leadership in nuclear power.
            (6) The development of advanced reactor designs would 
        benefit from a performance-based, risk-informed, efficient, and 
        cost-effective regulatory framework with defined milestones and 
        the opportunity for applicants to demonstrate progress through 
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Advanced reactor.--The term ``advanced reactor'' means 
        a nuclear fission reactor with significant design improvements 
        over the most recent generation of nuclear reactors. Such 
        improvements may include inherent safety features, lower waste 
        yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability, 
        resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal efficiency.
            (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the 
        Department of Energy.
            (3) Licensing.--The term ``licensing'' means NRC activities 
        related to reviewing applications for licenses, permits, and 
        design certifications, and requests for any other regulatory 
        approval for nuclear reactors within the responsibilities of 
        the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
            (4) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory'' 
        has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy 
        Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801).
            (5) NRC.--The term ``NRC'' means the Nuclear Regulatory 
        Commission.
            (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Energy.

SEC. 4. AGENCY COORDINATION.

    The NRC and the Department shall enter into the a memorandum of 
understanding regarding the following topics:
            (1) Technical expertise.--Ensuring that the Department has 
        sufficient technical expertise to support the civilian nuclear 
        industry's timely development and commercial deployment of 
        safe, innovative advanced reactor technology and the NRC has 
        sufficient technical expertise to support the evaluation of 
        applications for licenses, permits, and design certifications, 
        and other requests for regulatory approval for advanced 
        reactors.
            (2) Modeling and simulation.--The use of computers and 
        software codes to calculate the behavior and performance of 
        advanced reactors based on mathematical models of their 
        physical behavior.
            (3) Facilities.--Ensuring that the Department maintains and 
        develops the facilities to support the civilian nuclear 
        industry's timely development and commercial deployment of 
        safe, innovative reactor technology and ensuring that the NRC 
        has access to such facilities, as needed.

SEC. 5. REPORTING TO CONGRESS.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of 
the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources of the Senate a report that evaluates the status of 
activities intended to facilitate the testing and demonstration of 
advanced reactors on Department land and facilities and the potential 
for the Department to use testing and demonstration on private land.

SEC. 6. ADVANCED REACTOR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

    (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the NRC shall transmit to the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works of the Senate a plan for developing an 
efficient, risk-informed, technology-neutral framework for advanced 
reactor licensing. The plan shall evaluate the following subjects, 
consistent with the NRC's role in protecting public health and safety 
and common defense and security:
            (1) The unique aspects of advanced reactor licensing and 
        any associated legal, regulatory, and policy issues the NRC 
        will need to address to develop a framework for licensing 
        advanced reactors.
            (2) Options for licensing advanced reactors under existing 
        NRC regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 
        a proposed new regulatory framework, or a combination of these 
        approaches.
            (3) Options to expedite and streamline the licensing of 
        advanced reactors, including opportunities to minimize the time 
        from application submittal to final NRC approval and minimize 
        the delays that may result from any necessary amendments or 
        supplements to applications.
            (4) Options to expand the incorporation of consensus-based 
        codes and standards into the advanced reactor regulatory 
        framework to minimize time to completion and provide 
        flexibility in implementation.
            (5) Options to make the advanced reactor licensing 
        framework more predictable. This evaluation should consider 
        opportunities to improve the process by which application 
        review milestones are established and maintained.
            (6) Options to allow applicants to use phased review 
        processes under which the NRC issues approvals that do not 
        require the NRC to re-review previously approved information. 
        This evaluation shall consider the NRC's ability to review and 
        conditionally approve partial applications, early design 
        information, and submittals that contain design criteria and 
        processes to be used to develop information to support a later 
        phase of the design review.
            (7) The extent to which NRC action or modification of 
        policy is needed to implement any part of the plan required by 
        this subsection.
            (8) The role of licensing advanced reactors within NRC 
        long-term strategic resource planning, staffing, and funding 
        levels.
    (b) Coordination and Stakeholder Input Required.--In developing the 
plan required by subsection (a), the NRC shall seek input from the 
Department, the nuclear industry, and other public stakeholders.
    (c) Cost and Schedule Estimate.--The plan required by subsection 
(a) shall include proposed cost estimates, budgets, and specific 
milestones for implementing the advanced reactor regulatory framework 
by 2019.

SEC. 7. USER FEES AND ANNUAL CHARGES.

    Section 6101(c)(2)(A) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 2214(c)(2)(A)) is amended--
