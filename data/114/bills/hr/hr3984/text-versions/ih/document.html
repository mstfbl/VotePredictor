                                 A BILL


 
       To prevent diversion of funds from the Crime Victims Fund.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Crime Victims Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST CERTAIN CHANGES IN MANDATORY PROGRAMS 
              AFFECTING THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Crime Victims Fund was created in 1984, with the 
        support of overwhelming bipartisan majorities in the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate and the support of President 
        Ronald Reagan, who signed the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 
        (Public Law 98-473) into law;
            (2) the Crime Victims Fund was created based on the 
        principle that funds the Federal Government collects from those 
        convicted of crime should be used to aid those who have been 
        victimized by crime;
            (3) the Crime Victims Fund is funded from fines, penalties, 
        and forfeited bonds in Federal court and private donations;
            (4) the Crime Victims Fund receives no taxpayer dollars;
            (5) Federal law provides that funds deposited into the 
        Crime Victims Fund shall be used to provide services to victims 
        of crime in accordance with the Victims of Crime Act of 1984;
            (6) the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 gives priority to 
        victims of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic violence;
            (7) since fiscal year 2000, Congress has been taking funds 
        collected by the Crime Victims Fund and not disbursing the full 
        amount provided for under the Victims of Crime Act of 1984;
            (8) over $10,000,000,000 has been withheld from victims of 
        child abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other 
        crimes;
            (9) from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2014, the 
        Crime Victims Fund collected $12,000,000,000, but Congress 
        disbursed only $3,600,000,000 (or 30 percent) to crime victims;
            (10) under budget rules, Congress represents that the money 
        it has already spent in prior years is still in the Crime 
        Victims Fund and available for victims of crime;
            (11) Congress concludes that it is time to restore fairness 
        to crime victims; and
            (12) Congress concludes that henceforth, funds collected by 
        the Crime Victims Fund should be used for services to crime 
        victims in accordance with the Victims of Crime Act of 1984.
    (b) Amendment.--Title IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 
U.S.C. 651 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

                    ``(B) results in a net decrease in budget authority 
                in the current year or the budget year, but does not 
                result in a net decrease in outlays over the period of 
                the total of the current year, the budget year, and all 
                fiscal years covered under the most recently adopted 
                concurrent resolution on the budget;
            ``(2) the term `Crime Victims Fund' means the Crime Victims

        affecting the Crime Victims Fund applies.
    ``(b) Point of Order in the Senate.--
            ``(1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill or 
        joint resolution making appropriations for a fiscal year, or an 
        amendment thereto, amendment between the Houses in relation 
        thereto, conference report thereon, or motion thereon, if a 
        point of order is made by a Senator against a provision 
        containing a CHIMP that, if enacted, would cause the amount 
        available for obligation during the fiscal year from the Crime 
        Victims Fund to be less than the 3-year average amount, and the 
        point of order is sustained by the Chair, that provision shall 
        be stricken from the measure and may not be offered as an 
        amendment from the floor.
            ``(2) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under 
        paragraph (1) may be raised by a Senator as provided in section

        conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
        relation to, a bill or joint resolution, upon a point of order 
        being made by any Senator pursuant to paragraph (1), and such 
        point of order being sustained, such material contained in such 
        conference report or House amendment shall be stricken, and the 
        Senate shall proceed to consider the question of whether the 
        Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with a 
        further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a 
        further amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment 
        shall consist of only that portion of the conference report or 
        House amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. Any such 
        motion in the Senate shall be debatable. In any case in which 
        such point of order is sustained against a conference report 
        (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by 
        operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in 
        order.
            ``(4) Supermajority waiver and appeal.--In the Senate, this 
        subsection may be waived or suspended only by an affirmative 
        vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An 
        affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, 
        duly chosen and sworn shall be required to sustain an appeal of 
        the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this 
        subsection.
            ``(5) Determination.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        budgetary levels shall be determined on the basis of estimates 
        provided by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the 
        Senate.

            ``(1) In general.--A provision in a bill or joint 
        resolution making appropriations for a fiscal year that 
        proposes a CHIMP that, if enacted, would cause the amount 
        available for obligation during the fiscal year from the Crime 
        Victims Fund to be less than the 3-year average amount shall 
        not be in order in the House of Representatives.
            ``(2) Amendments and conference reports.--It shall not be 
        in order in the House of Representatives to consider an 
        amendment to, or a conference report on, a bill or joint 
        resolution making appropriations for a fiscal year if such 
        amendment thereto or conference report thereon proposes a CHIMP 
        that, if enacted, would cause the amount available for 
        obligation during the fiscal year from the Crime Victims Fund 
        to be less than the 3-year average amount.
