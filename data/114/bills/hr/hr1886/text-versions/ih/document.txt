                                 A BILL


 
To amend section 1341 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
   to repeal the funding mechanism for the transitional reinsurance 
       program in the individual market, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the most recent United States Census, 
        employer-based health insurance is the largest source of health 
        insurance coverage in the United States. Of those employed, 70 
        percent receive employment-based health insurance. Of 
        unemployed Americans, 30 percent receive employer-sponsored 
        health insurance.
            (2) Despite the large percentages of coverage, as health 
        care costs climb, the percentage of Americans who receive 
        health insurance through employers has fallen significantly 
        over the last decade--from 70 percent nationwide in 2000 to 60 
        percent in 2011, according to a report by the Robert Wood 
        Johnson Foundation.
            (3) According to recent surveys done by the National 
        Business Group on Health and the Kaiser Family Foundation, most 
        companies continue to provide health insurance for employees 
        and wish to continue doing so into the future.
            (4) Employers who offer insurance will not contribute 
        additional risk to the health insurance exchanges established 
        in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (in this Act 
        referred to as ``PPACA'').
            (5) The transitional reinsurance program, established in 
        section 1341 of PPACA, is intended to stabilize risk in the 
        individual health insurance market during the first three years 
        of the health insurance exchanges, as established by that Act.
            (6) PPACA also requires that the Treasury collect a fee for 
        each employer-sponsored covered life in order to pay for the 
        transitional reinsurance program.
            (7) This fee is a disincentive for employers to continue 
        offering coverage to all employees, and does not give employers 
        any benefits of the transitional reinsurance program.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to remove the current 
funding mechanism for the transitional reinsurance program. Employer-
sponsored insurance should be supported so that Americans can sustain 
quality health coverage.

              INDIVIDUAL MARKET.

            (5) in paragraph (4)(A), by striking ``used in any of the 
        three calendar years for which amounts are collected based on 
        the reinsurance needs of a particular period or to reflect 
        experience in a prior period'' and inserting ``only used with 
        respect to the calendar year for which amounts are collected 
        based on the reinsurance needs for that year, as determined by 
        the Secretary'';
            (6) in paragraph (4), by amending subparagraph (B) to read 
        as follows:

                appropriated, based on the best estimates of the NAIC,

                $4,000,000,000 for plan years beginning in 2016 to make 
                reinsurance payments to health insurance issuers that 
                cover high-risk individuals in the individual market 
                (excluding grandfathered health plans) that insure 
                high-risk individuals consistent with this paragraph.
                    ``(B) Fund availability.--The amounts appropriated 
                under subparagraph (A) for plans years beginning in a 
                calendar year shall be allocated among States and only

                amounts are collected based on the reinsurance needs 
                for that particular year, as determined by the 
                Secretary and the amounts remaining unexpended as of 
                December 31 of the following year shall be deposited 
                into the general fund of the Treasury of the United 
                States.
            ``(6) GAO audit of use of 2014 funds.--The Comptroller 
        General of the United States shall provide for an audit of
