        provides the Army with improved and necessary ballistic 
        protection for the heavy tactical vehicle fleet;
            (3) a secure heavy tactical vehicle fleet provides the Army 
        with greater logistical tractability and offers soldiers the 
        necessary flexibility to tailor armor levels based on threat 
        levels and mission requirements; and
            (4) as Congress provides for a modern and secure Army, it

            (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following 
        new paragraph:

        whose mobilization in an emergency would seriously impair the 
        capability of the parent Federal agency or office to function 
        effectively are not retained in the Ready Reserve.''; and

    ``(c) In this section, the term `Federal key position' means a 
Federal position that shall not be vacated during a national emergency 
or mobilization without seriously impairing the capability of the 
parent Federal agency or office to function effectively. There are four 
categories of Federal key positions, the first three of which are, by 
definition, key positions while the fourth category requires a case-by-
case determination and designation, as follows:
            ``(1) The Vice President of the United States or any 
        official specified in the order of presidential succession in 
        section 19 of title 3.

        Judge determines that mobilization of the Article III Judge 
        concerned will not seriously impair the capability of the 
        Judge's court to function effectively, the Chief Judge will 
        provide a certification to that effect to the Secretary 
        concerned. Concurrently, the affected Judge will provide a 
        statement to the Secretary concerned requesting continued 
        service in the Ready Reserve and acknowledging that he or she 
        may be involuntarily called to active duty under the laws of 
        the United States and the directives and regulations of the 
        Department of Defense and pledging not to seek to be excused

              IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES 
              ASSIGNED TO SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES.

striking ``2016'' and inserting ``2018''.

SEC. 573. SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND 
              TRANSITION OF MILITARY DEPENDENT STUDENTS.

that provide services to improve the academic achievement of military 
dependent students, including those nonprofit organizations whose 
programs focus on improving the civic responsibility of military 
dependent students and their understanding of the Federal Government 
through direct exposure to the operations of the Federal Government.

SEC. 574. STUDY REGARDING FEASIBILITY OF USING DEERS TO TRACK 
              DEPENDENTS OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND DEPARTMENT 
              OF DEFENSE CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ELEMENTARY OR 
              SECONDARY EDUCATION STUDENTS.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed 
Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report 
containing the results of a study regarding the feasibility of using

SEC. 575. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SUPPORT FOR DEPENDENTS OF MEMBERS 
              OF THE ARMED FORCES ATTENDING SPECIALIZED CAMPS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) It has been shown that some members of the Armed Forces 
        have a difficult time transitioning back into civilian life due 
        to post-traumatic stress and other behavioral health disorders 
        from traumatic events they experienced during combat.
            (2) The children of returning members of the Armed Forces 
        who suffer from post-traumatic stress and other behavioral 
        health disorders often also suffer from severe distress due to 
        the lack of a stable home environment and loss of a strong 
        parental figure for guidance.
            (3) The children of members of the Armed Forces who are in 
        severe distress can be helped by being given the opportunity to 
        participate in intensive specialized programs outside of their 
        regular environment with other children who are going through 
        similar situations.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Department of Defense should continue to support dependents of members 
of the Armed Forces in attending camps offered by nonprofit 
organizations that are using evidence-based practices to provide 
support to children grieving the loss of a parent, guardian, or 
sibling, or who have a parent, guardian, or sibling who suffers from 
post-traumatic stress or a behavioral health disorder.

              POSTHUMOUSLY PROMOTE MASTER SERGEANT (RETIRED) NAOMI 
              HORWITZ TO SERGEANT MAJOR.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Naomi Horwitz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1916.
            (2) In 1942, Ms. Horwitz marched into the Army recruiters 
        office and asked to join.
            (3) Ms. Horwitz served with the Women's Army Auxiliary 
        Corps, the Women's Army Corps, and the Reserves.
            (4) Ms. Horwitz served from 1942 until 1946 and reenlisted 
        a few years later.
            (5) On October 24, 1965, one of the proudest moments of her 
        military career, Ms. Horwitz's was promoted to the rank of 
        Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army Reserve.
            (6) As women were only eligible to hold the rank of 
        Sergeant Major since 1960, Ms. Horwitz was one of only a 
        handful of women to hold such rank during that time period.
            (7) Despite her promotion, Ms. Horwitz was not allowed to 
        hold the rank of Sergeant Major.
            (8) Ms. Horwitz retired from the military in 1976 at a 
        lower rank.
            (9) After her retirement from the military, Ms. Horwitz was 
        a tireless veteran's advocate serving for decades with AMVETS 
        Post 60, Jewish War Veterans, the American Legion Milwaukee 
        Women's Post 448, the Allied Veterans Council of Milwaukee and 
        the Veterans Day Parade Committee.
            (10) Ms. Horwitz was named Veteran of the Year in Milwaukee 
        County in 2004.
            (11) In October 2014, Ms. Horwitz died at the age of 98.
            (12) One of Ms. Horwitz's final wishes was that one of the 
        proudest moment of her Army career be reflected on her 
        gravestone.
            (13) In March 2015, the Secretary of the Army corrected 
        this injustice and approved a request to posthumously promote 
        Sergeant Major Horwitz.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) joins the Army and our Nation in expressing our 
        gratitude to Sergeant Major Naomi Horwitz for her 26 years of 
        honorable military service and continued civilian service; and
            (2) supports the decision of the Army to posthumously 
        promote Master Sergeant (retired) Naomi Horwitz to Sergeant 
        Major.

        Armed Forces.
            (2) Military divers were created at the turn of the 
        twentieth century, the trademark of diving is the Mark Five 
        Dive Helmet created in 1915.

        often without recognition, risking their lives on behalf of the 
        United States.
            (4) The United States will forever be in debt to personnel 
        in the profession of military diving for their bravery and 
        sacrifice in times of peace and war.
            (4) People in the United States should express their 
        recognition and gratitude for military divers and the diving 
        profession.
            (5) In 1939, when the submarine U.S.S. Squalus sank, Navy 
        divers used an experimental rig to rescue all 33 sailors aboard 
        the vessel who survived the initial sinking, and the divers 
        were awarded the Medal of Honor for their role in the rescue.
            (6) In 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Navy divers 
        raised every battleship that was sunk at Pearl Harbor, to the 
        surface (with the exception of the U.S.S. Arizona, U.S.S. Utah, 
        and the U.S.S. Oklahoma).
            (7) The raised ships were repaired and sent back out to 
        fight the Imperial Japanese Navy.
            (8) In 1986, when Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, Navy 
        divers recovered the remains and debris.
            (9) When TWA Flight 800, Swissair Flight 111, and EgyptAir 
        Flight 990 crashed, among others, Navy divers recovered the 
        remains and debris.
            (10) In 1999, when John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette, 
        and Lauren Bessette died in a plane crash, Navy divers 
        recovered their remains and debris.
            (11) In 2003, during the Quecreek Mine Rescue in Somerset 
        County, Pennsylvania, Navy divers treated the recovered miners 
        in Fly Away Recompression Chambers.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings under subsection

        military divers during the past 100 years;

        as military divers for their bravery; and

SEC. 714. PILOT PROGRAM FOR OPERATION OF NETWORK OF RETAIL PHARMACIES 
              UNDER TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS PROGRAM.

    (a) Authority to Establish Pilot Program.--The Secretary of Defense 
may conduct a pilot program to evaluate whether, in carrying out the 
TRICARE pharmacy benefits program under section 1074g of title 10, 
United States Code, operating a network of preferred retail pharmacies 
will generate cost savings for the Department of Defense.
    (b) Elements of Pilot Program.--In conducting the pilot program 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall--
            (1) incorporate ``best practices'' to enhance patient 
        access from non-TRICARE health plans that are using a preferred 
        retail network of pharmacies along with the mail-order pharmacy 
        program of the plans and preferred pharmacy networks in 
        Medicare Part D;
            (2) allow beneficiaries to obtain prescription medication 
        that is available through the TRICARE pharmacy benefits 
        program, including maintenance medication, through the network 
        of preferred retail pharmacies and the national mail-order 
        pharmacy program under section 1074g(a)(2)(E)(iii) of title 10 
        United States Code;
            (3) allow retail pharmacies participating in the network of 
        preferred retail pharmacies to purchase prescription medication 
        for beneficiaries in the pilot program at rates available to 
        the Federal government through its Prime Vendor contracting 
        process;
            (4) ensure that retail pharmacies participating in the 
        network of preferred retail pharmacies shall include small 
        business pharmacies (as defined by the Small Business 
        Administration) at a rate no lower than the current TRICARE 
        pharmacy program participation rate provided there are 
        sufficient number of small business pharmacies willing to 
        participate in the pilot program;
            (5) study the potential, viability, cost efficiency, and 
        health care effectiveness of the TRICARE pharmacy benefits 
        program administering prescription medication through a network 
        of preferred retail pharmacies in addition to the methods 
        available pursuant to section 1074g(a)(2)(E) of title 10, 
        United States Code; and
            (6) determine the opportunities for and barriers to 
        coordinating and leveraging the use of a network of preferred 
        retail pharmacies in addition to such methods available 
        pursuant to such section 1074g(a)(2)(E).
    (c) Selection of Retail Pharmacies.--The Secretary shall select the 
retail pharmacies to participate in the preferred network of preferred 
retail pharmacies pursuant to subsection (a) and shall work with small 
business pharmacies to participate in the pilot program. In making such 
selection the Secretary may--
            (1) require that retail pharmacies opt-in to the network 
        and agree to the reimbursement rates paid by the Secretary;
            (2) determine specific criteria for each retail pharmacy to 
        meet or that a certain number of retail pharmacies must meet;
            (3) use a competitive process; and
            (4) require the preferred pharmacy network to comply with 
        the existing TRICARE retail pharmacy access standards.
    (d) Selection of Military Communities.--In carrying out the pilot 
program under subsection (a), the Secretary shall give preference to 
regions with high small business pharmacy participation rates and shall 
select at least one region in which to carry out the pilot program. The 
Secretary shall ensure that any region selected meets the following 
criteria:
            (1) The region has a certain number or percentage, as 
        determined by the Secretary, of--
                    (A) members of the Armed Forces serving on active 
                duty;
                    (B) members of the Armed Forces serving in a 
                reserve component; and
                    (C) retired members of the Armed Forces.
            (2) The number of beneficiaries under paragraph (1) is 
        sufficient to produce statistically significant results.
            (3) The region has at least one retail pharmacy that 
        operates at least 10 pharmacy locations in the region.
            (4) The region has at least one military installation that 
        has a military medical treatment facility with a pharmacy.
    (e) Consultation.--The Secretary shall develop the pilot program 
under subsection (a) in consultation with--
            (1) the Secretaries of the military departments;
            (2) retail pharmacies;
            (3) representatives from the military installations within 
        the region selected under subsection (d); and
            (4) the TRICARE-managed pharmacy contractor with 
        responsibility for the national pharmacy mail-order program.

out the pilot program under subsection (a), the Secretary shall 
commence such pilot program by not later than May 1, 2016, and shall 
terminate such program on September 30, 2018.
    (g) Reports.--If the Secretary of Defense carries out the pilot 
program under subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
the congressional defense committees reports on the pilot program as 
follows:
            (1) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, a report containing an implementation plan for the 
        pilot program.
            (2) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the 
        pilot program commences, and semiannually thereafter during the 
        period in which the pilot program is carried out, an interim 
        report on the pilot program.
            (3) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the

SEC. 725. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING FOR 
              MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND FAMILIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It has been shown that some members of the Armed Forces 
        struggle with post-traumatic stress and other behavioral health 
        disorders from traumatic events experienced during combat.
            (2) It has also been shown that emotional distress and 
        trauma from life events can be exacerbated by traumatic events 
        experienced during combat.
            (3) Members of the Armed Forces who struggle with post-
        traumatic stress and other behavioral health disorders are 
        often unable to provide emotional support to spouses and 
        children, causing emotional distress and the risk of behavioral 
        health disorders among the dependents of the members.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should continue to support 
        members of the Armed Forces and their families by providing 
        family counseling and individual counseling services that 
        reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress and other 
        behavioral health disorders and empowers members to be 
        emotionally available to their spouses and children;
            (2) such services should be readily available at branches 
        of the Department and military bases;
            (3) the Department should rely on industry standards 
        established by the medical community when developing standards 
        for their own practice of family and individual counseling; and
            (4) the Department should conduct a five-year study of the 
        progress of members of the Armed Forces that are treated for 
        mental health disorders, including with respect to--
                    (A) difficulty keeping up with treatment;
                    (B) familial status before and after treatment; and
                    (C) access to mental health counseling at 
                Department facilities and military installations.

  TITLE VIII--ACQUISITION POLICY, ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT, AND RELATED 
                                MATTERS

SEC. 800. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DESIRED TENETS OF THE DEFENSE 
              ACQUISITION SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives held a series of hearings in 2013, 2014, and 
        2015 gathering testimony from key acquisition leaders and 
        experts. It is clear that the acquisition reform efforts of the 
        last 50 years continue to founder because they fail to address 
        the motivational and environmental factors in which they must 
        be implemented. The acquisition system, though frustrating to 
        all, is in one sense in equilibrium. The acquisition system 
        provides enough benefits to proponents and opponents to 
        continue, with only minor changes, despite its shortcomings.
            (2) The Armed Forces continue to pursue too many defense 
        acquisitions, chasing too few dollars. Consequently, there 
        remains a vast difference between the budgeting plans of the 
        Department and the reality of the cost of its systems or the 
        services it acquires.
            (3) To keep programs alive, the Department develops and 
        Congress accepts fragile acquisition strategies that downplay 
        technical issues and assume only successful outcomes from high-
        risk efforts. As a result, the Department often ends up with 
        too few weapons, with performance that falls short, that are 
        difficult and costly to maintain, delivered late at too high a 
        cost. Congressional and Department of Defense leadership have 
        limited insight into the services acquired or what services 
        need to be acquired in the future. Furthermore, the 
        conventional acquisition process is not agile enough for 
        today's demands. Finally, the Department of Defense continues 
        to struggle with financial management and auditability, 
        affecting its ability to control costs, ensure basic 
        accountability, anticipate future costs and claims on the 
        budget, and measure performance.
            (4) Too often today, all stakeholders in the Department of 
        Defense, Congress, and industry, accept that--
                    (A) for the acquisition process, success is defined 
                as maximizing technical performance or protecting 
                organizational interests, without regard to funding 
                disruptions and delivery delays of needed capability or 
                services to the warfighter; and
                    (B) the acquisition process is--
                            (i) reactive, meaning issues are addressed 
                        late and at great cost only after problems are 
                        realized;
                            (ii) plodding, meaning the bureaucratic 
                        processes are sclerotic and cumbersome;
                            (iii) opaque, meaning that limiting 
                        information is necessary to protect programs; 
                        and
                            (iv) traditional, meaning that customary 
                        approaches and suppliers are preferred over 
                        perceived risk of new or unique concepts and 
                        vendors.
            (5) Today, the United States is at a cross-roads, and if 
        changes to the acquisition system are not made soon, the trend 
        of fewer and more costly systems and services that fall short 
        of the needs of the Armed Forces will continue. Congress, the 
        Department of Defense, and industry all have a stake in making 
        positive changes. Each plays a role in contributing to the 
        current system. Each gains benefits from that system, but each 
        is frustrated by it as well.
            (6) The acquisition improvement effort of the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives proposes a 
        different approach from previous efforts by seeking to improve 
        the environment (i.e., statutes, regulations, processes, and 
        culture) driving acquisition decisions in the Department of 
        Defense, industry, and Congress. The Committee has solicited 
        input from industry and the Department of Defense, as well as 
        others in Congress, and will continue to do so. The Committee 
        recognizes that there are no ``silver bullets'' that can 
        immediately fix the current acquisition system in a holistic 
        and long-standing manner. Therefore, the reform effort will be 
        an ongoing and iterative process that will result in 
        legislation not only this year, but will be embedded in the 
        Committee's annual and regular work.
    (b) Sense of Congress on the Tenets of an Improved Acquisition 
System.--It is the sense of Congress that all stakeholders in the 
acquisition system--the Department of Defense, Congress, and industry--
should be governed by the following tenets:
            (1) Success.--Success in the acquisition system means the 
        timely delivery of affordable and effective military equipment 
        and services.
            (2) Proactive.--The acquisition system should be proactive, 
        meaning--
                    (A) the system should recognize that development 
                and acquisition problems can occur; and
                    (B) officials at all levels should be empowered to 
                solve problems and reduce risks by surfacing issues 
                early and honestly and taking action to resolve them.
            (3) Agile.--The acquisition system should be agile, meaning 
        that needed program adjustments to both respond to emerging 
        threats and the rapid pace of technological change and to 
        address development or production issues should be proposed and 
        adjudicated quickly.
            (4) Transparent.--The acquisition system should be 
        transparent, meaning that--
                    (A) all decision makers should be given useful, 
                relevant, credible, and reliable information when 
                making commitments;
                    (B) Government and industry communication should be 
                clear and open; and
                    (C) the Department of Defense should produce 
                auditable financial management statements.
            (5) Innovative.--The acquisition system should be 
        innovative, meaning that barriers should be removed that 
        preclude companies from undertaking defense business or 
        officials from proposing new approaches.

       Subtitle C--Weapon Systems Acquisition and Related Matters

SEC. 821. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE 
              WEAPON SYSTEMS ACQUISITION SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Current situation.--Despite significant and repeated 
        attempts at acquisition reform, the Department of Defense still 
        experiences case after case of expensive weapon system 
        acquisition failures. The Department of Defense has a track 
        record of too many cancellations, schedule slippages, cost 
        over-runs, and failures to deliver timely solutions to the 
        requirements of the Armed Forces. This situation is 
        unacceptable. For example, according to the Final Report of the 
        2010 Army Acquisition Review, between 1996 and 2010, the Army 
        expended approximately $1 billion to $3 billion annually on two 
        dozen programs that were eventually cancelled. No military 
        service and no type of weapon acquisition has been immune.
            (2) Problems in all phases of acquisitions.--
                    (A) Despite detailed weapon acquisition processes 
                and procedures, there is only limited discipline in 
                starting programs. Many programs begin without a solid 
                foundation. They have too many requirements deemed 
                ``critical'', which are driven by too many 
                organizations and individuals. Approved requirements 
                are often set with only a limited understanding of the 
                technical feasibility of achieving them. The resulting 
                compromises of good program management and engineering 
                judgment that allow the programs to proceed are the 
                ``spackle'' of the acquisition system that covers up 
                the risks and enables the system to operate.
                    (B) As these weapon systems proceed into 
                engineering and manufacturing development, they often 
                encounter development problems leading to cost growth, 
                schedule delay, and performance reductions. Industry 
                and Government officials frequently respond by taking 
                additional development risks to resolve basic 
                performance issues by reducing the time to analyze and 
                assess development results, overlapping key development 
                efforts, and reducing testing. The Department of 
                Defense and Congress disrupt the planned funding of 
                stable programs to find resources for troubled programs 
                or to fund across-the-board spending cuts. Funding 
                instability is the inevitable price that programs pay 
                for survival because funding disruptions actually keep 
                more programs alive.
                    (C) Finally, these weapons are often rushed into 
                production only to encounter production problems, and 
                are fielded with many unknowns or deficiencies leading 
                to significantly reduced quantities and force structure 
                reductions. The warfighter faces the challenge of 
                operating weapons with poor reliability, high 
                maintenance demands, reduced performance, and many 
                capability shortfalls.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--It is the sense of Congress that, in 
        accordance with the tenets described in section 800, to improve 
        weapon system acquisitions, the Department of Defense, 
        Congress, and industry should develop an acquisition system 
        characterized by highly disciplined program initiation coupled 
        with agile program execution and balanced oversight, as 
        described in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).
            (2) Highly disciplined program initiation.--An acquisition 
        system characterized by highly disciplined program initiation 
        means that programs do not begin engineering development until 
        firm requirements are matched to a flexible acquisition 
        strategy structured to develop militarily useful capability 
        that can be delivered in a relevant period of time with 
        available technologies, funding, and management capacity. Such 
        a highly disciplined program initiation includes--
                    (A) a workforce with smart requirements setters and 
                expert buyers, with the knowledge, skills, and 
                experience to successfully plan for and execute highly 
                complex acquisitions;
                    (B) requirements that are well-defined, technically 
                feasible, and affordable;
                    (C) acquisition strategies that are designed to 
                minimize time to market of militarily useful 
                capability, with the program concerned being structured 
                so that--
                            (i) lower-risk, technically mature 
                        capabilities are matched to delivering 
                        capability to the warfighter in the near term, 
                        while remaining requirements are aligned and 
                        resources are programmed to support integration 
                        into later increments to meet the requirements 
                        of the Armed Forces;
                            (ii) capabilities are approved for an 
                        increment only when their developmental risks 
                        have been appropriately reduced; and
                            (iii) increments are planned to complete 
                        engineering and manufacturing development in a 
                        reasonable period of time;
                    (D) a science and technology development enterprise 
                that is responsive to the acquisition process before 
                engineering and manufacturing development begins, and 
                sufficiently resourced to reduce risks and enable 
                programs to make smart decisions without losing 
                critical funds; and
                    (E) redtape reduction in order to free up program 
                and Department officials to focus on their mission of 
                defining an executable program and understanding and 
                addressing risks.
            (3) Agile program execution.--An acquisition system 
        characterized by agile program execution means a system in 
        which acquisition speed and flexibility to make trade-offs are 
        balanced with the need to achieve desired technical 
        performance. Such agile program execution includes--
                    (A) program managers and program officials who are 
                expert buyers and negotiators who anticipate problems, 
                negotiate solutions, and are empowered to manage;
                    (B) a preference for fixed price contracting where 
                appropriate for the size and complexity of the work and 
                for the nature and scope of the capabilities being 
                developed;
                    (C) program managers who avoid increasing program 
                risk by resisting the addition of new requirements or 
                the reduction of developmental activities;
                    (D) empowering program managers and senior 
                decisionmakers to make decisions easily in order to 
                move forward with capabilities that mature quickly, 
                cancel those that encounter greater difficulties than 
                expected, and trade-off or reduce requirements to 
                maintain cost and schedule;
                    (E) enabling program managers to focus on 
                overcoming execution challenges and delivering success 
                rather than concentrating on compliance with reporting, 
                certifications, and other redtape; and
                    (F) senior decisionmakers who have knowledge of 
                demonstrated performance as programs proceed through 
                development, with robust developmental testing 
                occurring before committing to production for 
                operational use as a basis for decision making.
            (4) Balanced oversight.--An acquisition system 
        characterized by balanced oversight means that the focus is on 
        ensuring discipline initiating programs and that appropriate 
        adjustments are made during development, so that programs have 
        the best chance to succeed. Such balanced oversight includes--
                    (A) involvement by decisionmakers early to ensure 
                that an understanding of trade-offs, risks, and needs 
                are considered, resourced, and validated, and that 
                agreement is reached between the executive and 
                legislative branches;
                    (B) acceptance by decisionmakers that complex 
                weapon system developments are inherently risky and 
                require expertise and flexibility to manage 
                effectively;
                    (C) conscious decisions by decisionmakers regarding 
                where to accept risk, while ensuring that risk 
                mitigation plans are resourced (with time, funding, 
                alternatives, and competent government and contractor 
                officials);
                    (D) measuring and monitoring by decisionmakers of 
                the right factors, such as technology maturation 
                progress and systems engineering during risk reduction, 
                development cost growth during engineering and 
                manufacturing development, and reliability growth 
                during system demonstration;
                    (E) work by Congress and the Department of Defense, 
                once a program has begun, to resolve issues by 
                considering trade-offs among cost, schedule, and 
                performance necessary to best support the warfighter; 
                and
                    (F) congressional understanding of risks and 
                efforts to mitigate such risks even if they are through 
                non-traditional means or other technological advances.

SEC. 846. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE AUCTIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, when used 
appropriately, reverse auctions may improve the Federal Government's 
procurement of commercially available commodities by increasing 
competition, reducing prices, and improving opportunities for small 
businesses.
    (b) Limitations on Reverse Auctions.--The Small Business Act (15 
U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 47 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) as 
        section 48; and
            (2) by inserting after section 46 the following new 
        section:

``SEC. 47. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE AUCTIONS.

    ``(a) Prohibition on Using Reverse Auctions for Covered 
Contracts.--In the case of a covered contract described in subsection 
(c), a reverse auction may not be used if the award of the contract is

            ``(2) section 8(m);
            ``(3) section 15(a);

    ``(b) Limitations on Using Reverse Auctions.--In the case of the 
award of a contract made under paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection 
(a) that is not a covered contract, a reverse auction may be used for 
the award of such a contract, but only if the following requirements 
are met:
            ``(1) Decisions regarding use of a reverse auction.--
        Subject to paragraph (2), the following decisions with respect 
        to such a contract shall be made only by a contracting officer:
                    ``(A) A decision to use a reverse auction as part 
                of the competition for award of such a contract.
                    ``(B) Any decision made after the decision 
                described in subsection (A) regarding the appropriate 
                evaluation criteria, the inclusion of vendors, the 
                acceptability of vendor submissions (including 
                decisions regarding timeliness), and the selection of 
                the winner.
            ``(2) Training required.--Only a contracting officer who 
        has received training on the appropriate use and supervision of 
        reverse auctions may use or supervise a reverse auction for the

        similar to the training provided by, the Defense Acquisition 
        University as described in section 824 of the Carl Levin and 
        Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291).
            ``(3) Number of offers; revisions to bids.--A Federal 
        agency may not award such a contract using a reverse auction if 
        only one offer is received or if offerors do not have the 
        ability to submit revised bids with lower prices throughout the 
        course of the auction.
            ``(4) Technically acceptable offers.--A Federal agency 
        awarding such a contract using a reverse auction shall evaluate 
        the technical acceptability of offers only as technically 
        acceptable or unacceptable.
            ``(5) Use of price rankings.--A Federal agency may not 
        award such a contract using a reverse auction if at any time 
        during the award process the Federal agency misinforms an 
        offeror about the price ranking of the offeror's last offer 
        submitted in relation to offers submitted by other offerors.
            ``(6) Use of third-party agents.--If a Federal agency uses 
        a third party agent to assist with the award of such a contract 
        using a reverse auction, the Federal agency shall ensure that--
                    ``(A) inherently governmental functions (as such 
                term is used in section 2303 of title 41, United States

                party agent and shared with the Federal agency is 
                shared with the offeror and complies with section 
                8(b)(7) of this Act; and
                    ``(D) disputes between the third party agent and an

                an offeror is not a responsible source (as defined in 
                section 113 of title 41, United States Code) or to 
                otherwise restrict the ability of an offeror to compete

SEC. 847. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROCUREMENT OF FIRE HOSES.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) The General Services Administration has historically 
        procured specialized fire hoses designed for combating 
        wildfires used by the Forest Service.
            (2) A memorandum of agreement was signed on February 5, 
        2014, by the Administrator of General Services and the Director 
        of the Defense Logistics Agency designating the Defense 
        Logistics Agency as the integrated material manager and source 
        of supply for such fire hoses.
            (3) While the intent of this agreement was to secure 
        efficiencies in procurement and cost savings for the 
        Government, the transfer of procurement authority to the 
        Department of Defense had the unintentional effect of requiring 
        all suppliers of such fire hoses to comply with the domestic 
        sourcing requirements of section 2533a of title 10, United 
        States Code, also known as the Berry Amendment.
            (4) There is currently only one known provider of such fire 
        hoses and that provider is not fully compliant with the 
        domestic sourcing requirements of the Berry Amendment.
            (5) As a result of the designation of the Defense Logistic 
        Agency as the integrated material manager for the procurement 
        of such fire hoses and the new requirement for compliance with 
        the Berry Amendment, the Forest Service does not anticipate the 
        ability to procure the necessary number of fire hoses before 
        the fire season begins in early June and is currently facing a 
        shortfall of 56,000 hoses out of the 93,000 required. According 
        to the Chief of the Forest Service, this shortfall represents a 
        critical risk to a number of States that are likely to 
        experience a season of above average wildfire activity.
            (6) During the period of May 1, 2014, through May 5, 2015, 
        less than 9 percent of quantities of such hoses purchased by 
        the Defense Logistics Agency were procured for the purposes of 
        the Department of Defense.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Based on the findings in subsection (a), it 
is the sense of Congress that procurement authority for specialized 
fire hoses for the United States Forest Service should be reestablished 
as an activity of the General Services Administration.

SEC. 864. USE OF LOWEST PRICE, TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE EVALUATION METHOD 
              FOR PROCUREMENT OF AUDIT OR AUDIT READINESS SERVICES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Given the size and scope of the Department of Defense, 
        the effort to finish and institutionalize auditability is one 
        of the more challenging management tasks that has ever faced 
        the Department.
            (2) The acquisition of services by the Department abides by 
        many rules and parameters, one of which is the lowest price, 
        technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation method.
            (3) The Department's audit effort is extremely complicated, 
        requiring personnel and assistance who have the financial 
        management and auditor skills that a non-independent public 
        accounting firm or a non-credentialed firm offering the lowest 
        price may not have.
            (4) In order for the Department to meet the September 30, 
        2017, audit readiness statutory deadline and the March 31, 
        2019, audit of fiscal year 2018 statutory deadline, it is 
        imperative that the Department not sacrifice contracts with 
        firms who have the proper credentials and expertise to meet 
        these deadlines.
            (5) The LPTA evaluation method is appropriate for 
        commercial or non-complex services or supplies where the 
        requirement is clearly definable and the risk of unsuccessful 
        contract performance is minimal. However, audit and audit 
        readiness services are complex and evolving.
    (b) Requirements Before Using LPTA Evaluation Method.--Before using 
the lowest price, technically acceptable evaluation method for the 
procurement of audit or audit readiness services, the Secretary of 
Defense shall--
            (1) establish the values and metrics for the services being 
        procured, including domain expertise and experience, size and 
        scope of offeror's team, personnel qualifications and 
        certifications, technology, and tools; and
            (2) review each offeror's past performance requirements.

requirements of this section shall not apply to any product that is

SEC. 904. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) As senior United States statesman Dr. Henry Kissinger 
        wrote in testimony submitted to the Senate Armed Services 
        Committee on January 29, 2015, ``The United States has not 
        faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end 
        of the Second World War.''.
            (2) The rise of non-state forces and near peer competitors 
        has introduced destabilizing pressures around the globe.
            (3) Advances in information and weapons technology have 
        reduced the time available for the United States to prepare for 
        and respond to crises against both known and unknown threats.
            (4) The importance of the maritime domain cannot be 
        overstated. As acknowledged in the March 2015 Navy, Marine 
        Corps, and Coast Guard maritime strategy, ``A Cooperative 
        Strategy for 21st Century Seapower'': ``Oceans are the 
        lifeblood of the interconnected global community. . . 90 
        percent of trade by volume travels across the oceans. 
        Approximately 70 percent of the world's population lives within 
        100 miles of the coastline.''.
            (5) The United States must be prepared to rapidly respond 
        to crises around the world regardless of the nation's fiscal 
        health.
            (6) In this global security environment, it is critical 
        that the nation possess a maritime force whose mission and 
        ethos is readiness--a fight tonight force, forward deployed, 
        that can respond immediately to emergent crises across the full 
        range of military operations around the globe either from the 
        sea or home station.
            (7) The need for such a force was recognized by the 82nd 
        Congress after the major wars of the twentieth century, when it 
        mandated a core mission for the nation's leanest force--the 
        Marine Corps--to be most ready when the nation is least ready.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the Marine Corps, within the Department of the 
                Navy, remain the Nation's expeditionary, crisis 
                response force;
                    (B) the need for such a force with such a 
                capability has never been greater; and
                    (C) accordingly, in recognition of this need and 
                the wisdom of the 82nd Congress, the 114th Congress 
                reaffirms section 5063 of title 10, United States Code, 
                uniquely charging the United States Marine Corps with 
                this responsibility.
            (2) It is further the sense of Congress that the Marine 
        Corps--
                    (A) shall--
                            (i) be organized to include not less than 
                        three combat divisions and three air wings, and 
                        such other land combat, aviation, and other 
                        services as may be organic therein;
                            (ii) be organized, trained, and equipped to 
                        provide fleet marine forces of combined arms, 
                        together with supporting air components, for 
                        service with the fleet in the seizure or 
                        defense of advanced naval bases and for the 
                        conduct of such land operations as may be 
                        essential to the prosecution of a naval 
                        campaign; and
                            (iii) provide detachments and organizations 
                        for service on armed vessels of the Navy, shall 
                        provide security detachments for the protection 
                        of naval property at naval stations and bases, 
                        and shall perform such other duties as the 
                        President may direct;
                but these additional duties may not detract from nor 
                interfere with the operations for which the Marine 
                Corps is primarily organized;
                    (B) shall develop, in coordination with the Army 
                and the Air Force, those phases of amphibious 
                operations that pertain to the tactics, techniques, and 
                equipment used by landing forces; and
                    (C) is responsible, in accordance with the 
                integrated joint mobilization plans, for the expansion 
                of peacetime components of the Marine Corps to meet the 
                needs of war.

SEC. 905. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STREAMLINING OF DEPARTMENT OF 
              DEFENSE MANAGEMENT HEADQUARTERS.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) On July 31, 2013, the then Secretary of Defense stated 
        that the Department would ``reduc[e] the Department's major 
        headquarters budgets by 20 percent. . .Although the 20 percent 
        cut applies to budget dollars, organizations will strive for a 
        goal of 20 percent reductions in government civilians and 
        military personnel.'' The then Secretary further stated that 
        ``these management reforms. . .will reduce the Department's 
        overhead and operating costs by...$10 billion over the next 
        five years.''.
            (2) Furthermore, the President's budget request for the 
        Department of Defense for fiscal year 2015 stated that 
        reductions to management headquarters staff and consolidation 
        of duplicative efforts across the Department would result in a 
        savings of $5.3 billion over 5 years--through fiscal year 2019. 
        However, as noted by the Government Accountability Office in a 
        January 2015 report (GAO-15-10), the Department accounted for 
        $5.3 billion as efficiency savings in its budget request, but 
        has not provided specific details on the reductions to 
        management headquarters' staff it plans to make.
            (3) In June 2014, the Government Accountability Office 
        found (in GAO-14-439) that the Department did not have an 
        accurate accounting of the resources being devoted to 
        management headquarters to use as a starting point for tracking 
        reductions to such headquarters. In April 2015, the Government 
        Accountability Office reported (in GAO-15-404SP) that focusing 
        reductions on management headquarters budgets and personnel, 
        which tend to be inconsistently defined and often represent a 
        small portion of the overall headquarters, shields much of the 
        resources identified for potential reduction.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense's commitment in July 2013 to a 
        goal of a 20 percent reduction in headquarters budgets and 
        personnel and a goal of $10 billion in cost savings over five 
        years is worthwhile and should be fully implemented;
            (2) without a clear baseline for management headquarters, 
        it is difficult to demonstrate and track progress achieving 
        actual savings;
            (3) any reduction in personnel should not be implemented as 
        an across-the-board cut, but rather should be strategically 
        designed to retain critical functions, capabilities, and skill 
        sets--including but not limited to depots and the acquisition 
        workforce--and eliminate unnecessary or redundant functions or 
        skill sets that do not benefit or support mission requirements;
            (4) functions should be performed at the lowest appropriate 
        organizational level and those organizations should be 
        empowered and held accountable;
            (5) duplicative functions at higher level organizations 
        should be eliminated; and
            (6) the movement of a function from a management 
        headquarters to a different Department of Defense organization 
        or a lower level organization does not result in an efficiency, 
        since the same budget is still required to perform that 
        function.
    (c) Requirement to Implement 20 Percent Reduction in Management 
Headquarters Functions.--Section 904 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66; 10 U.S.C. 
111 note) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) Implementation of Management Headquarters Reduction.--The 
Secretary of Defense shall implement the 20 percent reduction directed 
by the Secretary in July 2013 in management headquarters budget and 
personnel by September 30, 2019, for the covered organizations in the 
National Capital Region (as defined in section 2674(f) of title 10, 
United States Code). Such reductions shall be strategically designed to 
retain critical functions, capabilities, and skill sets. Management, 
functions, programs, or offices shall be moved to the lowest 
appropriate organizational level. In any report issued pursuant to 
subsection (d), the Secretary may not claim a cost savings solely based 
on moving management, functions, programs, or offices from one 
organization to another.''.
    (d) Limitation on Working-capital Fund Positions.--Section 904 of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 
113-66; 10 U.S.C. 111 note) is further amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(f) Limitation on Working-capital Fund Positions.--In 
implementing the 20 percent reduction referred to in subsection (e), 
the Secretary of Defense may not reduce the number of Department of 
Defense civilian employees whose salaries are funded from working-
capital funds except in accordance with section 2472 of title 10, 
United States Code.''.
    (e) Change in Deadline for Required Plan.--Section 904(a) of the 
such Act is amended by striking ``180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act'' and inserting ``March 31, 2016''.
    (f) Additional Elements of Plan.--Section 904(b) of such Act is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) as

        including what is and is not included as part of management 
        headquarters accounting, and a detailed description of the 
        number of personnel, budgets, functions, capabilities, and 
        skill sets.'';
            (3) in paragraph (2), as so redesignated--
                    (A) by inserting ``actual and'' before ``planned 
                changes'';
                    (B) by striking ``staffing'' and inserting 
                ``personnel''; and
                    (C) by inserting before the period at the end the 
                following: ``, set forth separately by fiscal year, 
                from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2019'';
            (4) in paragraph (3), as so redesignated--

        year 2014, and estimated savings to be achieved, along with 
        associated changes or reductions in budget, for each of fiscal 
        years 2014 through 2024''.
    (g) Additional Report Requirements.--Section 904(d) of such Act is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``180 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act'' and inserting ``March 31,

                        represents a redundant management or oversight

SEC. 906. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT AND WORKFORCE 
              INCENTIVE SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 1113 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84) required the 
        Department of Defense to institute a fair, credible, and 
        transparent performance appraisal system, given the name ``New 
        Beginnings,'' for employees, which--
                    (A) links employee bonuses and other performance-
                based action to employee performance appraisals;
                    (B) ensures ongoing performance feedback and 
                dialogue among supervisors, managers, and employees 
                throughout the appraisal period, with timetables for 
                review; and
                    (C) develops performance assistance plans to give 
                employees formal training, on-the-job training, 
                counseling, mentoring, and other assistance.
            (2) The military components and defense agencies of the 
        Department of Defense are currently reviewing the proposed 
        ``New Beginnings'' performance management and workforce 
        incentive system developed in response to section 1113 of 
        Public Law 111-84.
            (3) The Department of Defense anticipates it will begin 
        implementation of the ``New Beginnings'' performance management 
        and workforce incentive system in April 2016.
            (4) The authority provided in section 1113 of Public Law 
        111-84 provided the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with 
        the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, 
        flexibilities in promulgating regulations to redesign the 
        procedures which are applied by the Department of Defense in 
        making appointments to positions within the competitive service 
        in order to--
                    (A) better meet mission needs;
                    (B) respond to managers' needs and the needs of 
                applicants;
                    (C) produce high-quality applicants;
                    (D) support timely decisions;
                    (E) uphold appointments based on merit system 
                principles; and
                    (F) promote competitive job offers.
            (5) In implementing the ``New Beginnings'' performance 
        management and workforce incentive system, section 113 of 
        Public Law 111-84 requires the Secretary of Defense to comply 
        with veterans' preference requirements.
            (6) Among the criteria for the new performance management 
        and workforce incentive system authorized under section 1113 of 
        Public Law 111-84, the Secretary of Defense is required to--
                    (A) adhere to merit principles;
                    (B) include a means for ensuring employee 
                involvement (for bargaining unit employees, through 
                their exclusive representatives) in the design and 
                implementation of the performance management and 
                workforce incentive system;
                    (C) provide for adequate training and retraining 
                for supervisors, managers, and employees in the 
                implementation and operation of the performance 
                management and workforce incentive system;
                    (D) develop a comprehensive management succession 
                program to provide training to employees to develop 
                managers for the agency and a program to provide 
                training to supervisors on actions, options, and 
                strategies a supervisor may use in administering the 
                performance management and workforce incentive system;
                    (E) include effective transparency and 
                accountability measures and safeguards to ensure that 
                the management of the performance management and 
                workforce incentive system is fair, credible, and 
                equitable, including appropriate independent 
                reasonableness reviews, internal assessments, and 
                employee surveys;
                    (F) use the annual strategic workforce plan 
                required by section 115b of title 10; and
                    (G) ensure that adequate agency resources are 
                allocated for the design, implementation, and 
                administration of the performance management and 
                workforce incentive system.
            (7) Section 1113 of Public Law 111-84 also requires the 
        Secretary of Defense to develop a program of training--to be 
        completed by a supervisor every three years--on the actions, 
        options, and strategies a supervisor may use in--
                    (A) developing and discussing relevant goals and 
                objectives with the employee, communicating and 
                discussing progress relative to performance goals and 
                objectives, and conducting performance appraisals;
                    (B) mentoring and motivating employees, and 
                improving employee performance and productivity;
                    (C) fostering a work environment characterized by 
                fairness, respect, equal opportunity, and attention to 
                the quality of the work of employees;
                    (D) effectively managing employees with 
                unacceptable performance;
                    (E) addressing reports of a hostile work 
                environment, reprisal, or harassment of or by another 
                supervisor or employee; and
                    (F) allowing experienced supervisors to mentor new 
                supervisors by sharing knowledge and advice in areas 
                such as communication, critical thinking, 
                responsibility, flexibility, motivating employees, 
                teamwork, leadership, and professional development, and 
                pointing out strengths and areas of development.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should proceed with the collaborative work with 
employee representatives on the ``New Beginnings'' performance 
management and workforce incentive system and begin implementation of 
the new system at the earliest possible date.

SEC. 907. GUIDELINES FOR CONVERSION OF FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY CIVILIAN 
              OR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL TO PERFORMANCE BY MILITARY 
              PERSONNEL.

SEC. 1012. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON PLAN CENTRAL AMERICA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The stability and security of Central American nations 
        have a direct impact on the stability and security of the 
        United States.
            (2) Over the past decade, stability and increased security 
        in the Republic of Colombia has pushed illicit trafficking to 
        Central America bringing increased violence and instability.
            (3) Much of Central America has seen spikes in violence and 
        homicides. In fiscal year 2013, the United Nations Office on 
        Drugs and Crime released its Global Study on Homicide 2013. 
        Four of the top five countries with the highest homicide rates 
        in the world were Central American nations including Honduras, 
        Belize, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
            (4) In calendar year 2014, approximately 65,000 
        unaccompanied alien children from Central America entered the 
        United States through its southwest border. This number of such 
        children who enter the United States during calendar year 2015 
        is expected to be approximately the same.
            (5) The southwest border of the United States continues to 
        be porous to illicit trafficking of narcotics, weapons, cash, 
        and people.
            (6) In November 2014, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador 
        announced a Plan for the Alliance for Prosperity of the 
        Northern Triangle. This plan is a comprehensive approach to 
        address the ongoing violence and instability facing these three 
        nations by stimulating economic opportunities, improving public 
        safety and rule of law, and strengthening institutions to 
        increase trust in the state.
            (7) The United States Government has stated its support for 
        the Alliance for Prosperity and included in the President's 
        fiscal year 2016 budget request $1,000,000,000 in Department of 
        State funds, to support the strategy for United States 
        engagement in Central America. According to the strategy, this 
        funding will be focused on promoting prosperity and regional 
        economic integration, enhancing security, and promoting 
        improved governance.
            (8) None of the President's $1,000,000,000 budget request 
        for the strategy for United States engagement in Central 
        America includes any funding for Department of Defense programs 
        in the region.
            (9) The Department of Defense provides training, equipment, 
        education, and interdiction efforts to address security 
        challenges in Central America through detection and monitoring 
        of illicit trafficking, assistance in illicit trafficking 
        interdictions, and building partnership capacities.
            (10) The Department of Defense through its roles and 
        missions, is executing a plan to address security challenges in 
        Central America in conjunction with the United States Strategy 
        for Engagement in Central America.
    (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States to 
prioritize a Plan Central America to address the threatening levels of 
violence, instability, illicit trafficking, and transnational organized 
crime that challenge the sovereignty of Central American nations and 
security of the United States. In order to address such issues, the 
Department of Defense shall--
            (1) increase the efforts of the Department of Defense as 
        the lead agency to detect and monitor the aerial and maritime 
        illicit trafficking into the United States;
            (2) increase the efforts of the Department of Defense to 
        support aerial and maritime illicit trafficking interdiction 
        efforts;
            (3) increase the efforts of the Department of Defense to 
        build partnership capacity with partner nations in Central 
        America to confront security challenges through increased 
        training opportunities, education, and exercises;
            (4) enforce human rights requirements consistent with 
        section 2249e of title 10, United States Code, and increase the 
        training and education regarding human rights provided in 
        Central American nations; and
            (5) support interagency efforts in Central America 
        addressing all levels of instability including development, 
        education, economic, political, and security challenges.

                terrorist activity; and
                    (F) has agreed to share with the United States any

        requirements under paragraph (1).
    (c) Prohibition in Cases of Prior Confirmed Recidivism.--
            (1) Prohibition.--Except as provided in paragraph (2) and 
        subsection (d), the Secretary of Defense may not use any

        individual detained at Guantanamo to the custody or control of 
        the individual's country of origin, any other foreign country,

        individual who was detained at United States Naval Station, 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, at any time after September 11, 2001, who 
        was transferred to such foreign country or entity and

            (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any action 
        taken by the Secretary to transfer any individual detained at

        transfer of a certification requirement specified in 
        subparagraph (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1) or the prohibition 
        in subsection (c), if the Secretary certifies the rest of the 
        criteria required by subsection (b) for transfers prohibited by 
        (c) and determines that--
                    (A) alternative actions will be taken to address

                requirements to be waived;
                    (B) in the case of a waiver of subparagraph (D) or

                that the risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                have been completely eliminated, but the actions to be 
                taken under subparagraph (A) will substantially 
                mitigate such risks with regard to the individual to be 
                transferred;
                    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection (c), the 
                Secretary has considered any confirmed case in which an 
                individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and
                    (D) the transfer is in the national security 
                interests of the United States.
            (2) Reports.--Whenever the Secretary makes a determination 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the

                            (ii) in the case of a waiver of paragraph 
                        (D) or (E) of subsection (b)(1), an explanation

                        risks addressed in the paragraph to be waived 
                        have been completely eliminated; and

                                Department of Defense; and
                                    (II) the agreements and mechanisms 
                                in place to provide for continuing

SEC. 1059. PROHIBITION ON THE CLOSURE OF UNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, 
              GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States military presence in the Republic of 
        Cuba began in 1898, and United States military basing began in 
        Cuba in 1903.
            (2) In 1934, the United States and Cuba entered into the 
        Treaty Between the United States of America and Cuba signed at 
        Washington, D.C. on May 29, 1934. Under Article III, the treaty 
        stipulates the perpetual lease agreement between the United 
        States and Cuba for the 45 square miles of land encompassing 
        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
            (3) On March 12, 2015, Commander of United States Southern 
        Command, General John Kelly, testified before the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the Senate, highlighting, ``Its [Naval 
        Station Guantanamo Bay] airfield and port facilities are 
        indispensable to the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, 
        and State's operational and contingency plans. . . As the only 
        permanent U.S. military base in Latin America and the 
        Caribbean, its location provides persistent U.S. presence and 
        immediate access to the region, as well as supporting a layered 
        defense to secure the air and maritime approaches to the United 
        States''.
            (4) Former Commander of United States Southern Command, 
        retired Admiral James Stavridis, recently stated ``Guantanamo 
        Bay Naval Station has immense strategic value above and beyond 
        its reputation as a detention facility. It is the logistic, 
        planning, surveillance and basing linchpin for the U.S. Fourth 
        Fleet, crucial to the military for disaster relief, 
        humanitarian work, medical diplomacy, and counternarcotics, all 
        key missions for the U.S. Navy in Latin America and the 
        Caribbean. The U.S. should do all in its power to maintain its 
        legal control over the base''.
            (5) In testimony in front of the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the House of Representatives in 2012, then-
        Commander of United States Southern Command, General Douglas 
        Fraser, stated, ``Absent a detention facility and even 
        following the eventual demise of the Castro regime, the 
        strategic capability provided by the U.S. Naval Station 
        Guantanamo Bay remains essential for executing national 
        priorities throughout the Caribbean, Latin America, and South 
        America''.
            (6) As part of ``normalizing'' relations with the 
        government of Cuba, announced in December 2014, ongoing 
        negotiations are occurring to determine the diplomatic 
        framework between the governments of the United States and 
        Cuba.
            (7) In January 2015, soon after negotiations began between 
        the United States and Cuba, Cuban President Raul Castro 
        demanded the return of United States Naval Station, Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba, to Cuba.
            (8) In February 2015, Assistant Secretary of State for 
        Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson, in testimony in 
        front of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of 
        Representatives, stated that the return of United States Naval 
        Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is ``not on the table in these 
        conversations'', referencing current diplomatic negotiations. 
        Later in her testimony Assistant Secretary Jacobson pointed 
        out, referring to the possible closure of the Naval Station, 
        that she is not a ``high enough ranking person to know. . 
        .whether it could be in the future''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the strategic, logistic, and postural significance of 
        United States Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is vital to 
        the security of the United States; and
            (2) the United States must not relinquish control of 
        Guantanamo Bay to the Republic of Cuba.
    (c) Prohibition.--United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, may not be closed or abandoned, and the President shall ensure 
that the obligations of the United States under Article III of the 
Treaty Between the United States of America and Cuba signed at 
Washington, D.C. on May 29, 1934 are met, including the payment of the 
annual lease sum to the government of Cuba, unless otherwise 
specifically provided--
            (1) by law;
            (2) in a treaty that is ratified with the advice and 
        consent of the Senate; or
            (3) by a modification of the Treaty Between the United 
        States of America and Cuba signed at Washington, D.C. on May 
        29, 1934, that is ratified with the advice and consent of the 
        Senate.

        Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

                    (C) An assessment of United States Naval Station, 
                Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in support of the National

                the National Military Strategy.
                    (D) An assessment of missions and military 
                requirements that United States Naval Station,

                Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba by other United

                the Commander.
            (3) Appropriate committees of congress.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' 
        means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Appropriations, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
                of the House of Representatives; and
                    (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Appropriations, and the Committee on Foreign 
                Relations of the Senate.

        of both military and civil airlift resources and their 
        interdependence in the fulfillment of the national defense 
        airlift objective, and it states that the ``Department of

            (1) National Guard personnel need to have situational 
        awareness and reliable communications in the event of an

            (2) in the event of such an emergency, attack, or disaster, 
        the ability of the National Guard personnel to communicate and 
        coordinate response is vital;

        National Guard, including commercial wireless solutions, such 
        as mobile wireless kinetic mesh and other systems that are

        environments where infrastructure is damaged, destroyed, or 
        under cyber attack or disruption; and

        improve and expand its communications and networking

            (1) while recruitment and advertising in support of the

        appropriate, the taxpayer should not have to pay any 
        organization to honor the service of members of the Armed 
        Forces;
            (2) instead of being paid by the Department of Defense to 
        honor the service of members of the Armed Forces, these 
        organizations should be motivated by patriotism to honor the 
        service of members of the Armed Forces out of their own free 
        will; and
            (3) any funds that the Department of Defense would have 
        used for purposes described in paragraph (1) should be 
        redirected toward post-traumatic stress disorder research and 
        treatment for members of the Armed Forces.

        security interests in ensuring that Afghanistan is a stable, 
        sovereign country;
            (2) President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan should be 
        applauded for his leadership and commitment to ensuring that 
        Afghanistan remains stable, secure, and a friend of the United 
        States;
            (3) the decision by the President of the United States to 
        maintain 9,800 United States troops in Afghanistan through all 
        of 2015 to train, advise, and assist and conduct 
        counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan is the appropriate 
        approach, is consistent with United States national security 
        interests, and should be supported by Congress;
            (4) the President should withdraw United States troops only 
        on a pace that is consistent with the ability of the Afghan 
        National Security Forces to sustain itself and secure 
        Afghanistan and should review maintaining the United States

        2018 while also maintaining a focus on the protection of human 
        rights;

        independent capability to prevent groups such as al-Qaeda, the 
        Haqqani Network, the Quetta Shura Taliban, and other terrorist 
        and insurgent groups from being able to conduct de-stabilizing 
        attacks and military operations inside Afghanistan or against 
        the United States and its allies and holding or governing 
        territory; and
            (7) the United States should continue to vigorously conduct

SEC. 1219. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO DR. SHAKIL AFRIDI.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The attacks of September 11, 2001, killed approximately 
        3,000 people, most of whom were Americans, but also included 
        hundreds of individuals with foreign citizenships, nearly 350 
        New York Fire Department personnel, and about 50 law 
        enforcement officers.
            (2) Downed United Airlines flight 93 was reportedly 
        intended, under the control of the al-Qaeda high-jackers, to 
        crash into the White House or the Capitol in an attempt to kill 
        the President of the United States or Members of the United 
        States Congress.
            (3) The September 11, 2001, attacks were largely planned 
        and carried out by the al-Qaeda terrorist network led by Osama 
        bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al Zawahiri, after which Osama 
        bin Laden enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan from where he 
        continued to plot deadly attacks against the United States and 
        the world.
            (4) The United States has obligated nearly $30 billion 
        between 2002 and 2014 in United States taxpayer money for 
        security and economic aid to Pakistan.
            (5) The United States very generously and swiftly responded 
        to the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake in Pakistan with more than $200 
        million in emergency aid and the support of several United 
        States military aircraft, approximately 1,000 United States 
        military personnel, including medical specialists, thousands of 
        tents, blankets, water containers and a variety of other 
        emergency equipment.
            (6) The United States again generously and swiftly 
        contributed approximately $150 million in emergency aid to 
        Pakistan following the 2010 Pakistan flood, in addition to the 
        service of nearly twenty United States military helicopters, 
        their flight crews, and other resources to assist the Pakistan 
        Army's relief efforts.
            (7) The United States continues to work tirelessly to 
        support Pakistan's economic development, including millions of 
        dollars allocated towards the development of Pakistan's energy 
        infrastructure, health services and education system.
            (8) The United States and Pakistan continue to have many 
        critical shared interests, both economic and security related, 
        which could be the foundation for a positive and mutually 
        beneficial partnership.
            (9) Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physician, is a hero to 
        whom the people of the United States, Pakistan and the world 
        owe a debt of gratitude for his help in finally locating Osama 
        bin Laden before more innocent American, Pakistani and other 
        lives were lost to this terrorist leader.
            (10) Pakistan, the United States and the international 
        community had failed for nearly 10 years following attacks of 
        September 11, 2001, to locate and bring Osama bin Laden, who 
        continued to kill innocent civilians in the Middle East, Asia, 
        Europe, Africa and the United States, to justice without the 
        help of Dr. Afridi.
            (11) The Government of Pakistan's imprisonment of Dr. 
        Afridi presents a serious and growing impediment to the United 
        States' bilateral relations with Pakistan.
            (12) The Government of Pakistan has leveled and allowed 
        baseless charges against Dr. Afridi in a politically motivated, 
        spurious legal process.
            (13) Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Government 
        of Pakistan, a deplorable and unconscionable situation which 
        calls into question Pakistan's actual commitment to countering 
        terrorism and undermines the notion that Pakistan is a true 
        ally in the struggle against terrorism.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Dr. Shakil 
Afridi is an international hero and that the Government of Pakistan 
should release him immediately from prison.

activities of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq. The report

        Security Cooperation in Iraq, in conjunction with other United 
        States programs, such as Foreign Military Financing program and 
        the Foreign Military Sales program, will address the capability 
        gaps of the Iraqi Security Forces and coordinate activities to 
        provide for the training and equipping of the Iraqi Security 
        Forces.
            (2) A description of constraints, if any, caused by the 
        operational environment in Iraq on the ability of the Office of 
        Security Cooperation in Iraq to carry out its mission.

SEC. 1222. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR THE MIDDLE EAST AND TO COUNTER 
              ISLAMIC EXTREMISM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the House of Representatives, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman 
        of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated, ``The global security 
        environment is as uncertain as I have seen in my 40 years of 
        service.''.
            (2) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate, the Director of National Intelligence, James 
        Clapper, stated: ``Sunni violent extremists are gaining 
        momentum and the number of Sunni violent extremist groups, 
        members, and safe havens is greater than at any other point in 
        history.''.
            (3) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        House of Representatives, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, 
        former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency stated, ``. 
        . .whether it be the number of violent Islamist groups, the 
        territory which they control, the scale and scope of the 
        Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and associated 
        movements, the number of terrorist attacks they perpetrate, the 
        numbers of causalities they inflict, their broad expansion and 
        use of the internet, or just their sheer barbarism; I can draw 
        no other conclusion than to say that the threat of Islamic 
        extremism has reached an unacceptable level and that it is 
        growing.''.
            (4) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate, James Clapper, the Director of National 
        Intelligence, stated the following:
                    (A) ``When the final counting is done, 2014 will 
                have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in 
                the 45 years such data has been compiled . . . about 
                half of all attacks, as well as fatalities, in 2014 
                occurred in just three countries: Iraq, Pakistan and 
                Afghanistan . . . the Islamic State in Iraq and the 
                Levant (ISIL) conducted more attacks than any other 
                terrorist group in the first nine months of 2014.''.
                    (B) ``Since the conflict began, more than 20,000 
                Sunni foreign fighters have traveled to Syria from more 
                than 90 countries to fight the Assad regime . . . of 
                that number, at least 13,600 have extremist ties.''.
                    (C) ``More than 3,400 Western fighters have gone to 
                Syria and Iraq. Hundreds have returned home to 
                Europe.''.
                    (D) ``About 180 Americans or so have been involved 
                in various stages of travel to Syria . . . and some 
                number have come back.''.
                    (E) ``ISIL, al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda in the Arabian 
                Peninsula (AQAP), and, most recently, al-Shabaab are 
                calling on their supporters to conduct lone-wolf 
                attacks against the United States and other Western 
                countries. Of the 13 attacks in the West since last 
                May, 12 were conducted by individual extremists.''.
            (5) AQAP continues to be one of al-Qaeda's most capable 
        affiliates, has the intent and capability to attack the United 
        States and its allies, and attempted attacks inside the United 
        States on December 25, 2009, and October 27, 2010.
            (6) Iran has been a Department of State-designated state 
        sponsor of terrorism since January 19, 1984, and continues to 
        sponsor and support terrorism throughout the Middle East region 
        and around the world.
            (7) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate, former Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, General 
        Jack Keane (retired), stated, ``Is it possible to . . . claim 
        that the United States policy and strategy is working or that 
        al-Qaeda is on the run? It is unmistakable that our policies 
        have failed . . . And the unequivocal explanation is U.S. 
        policy has focused on disengaging from the Middle East.''.
            (8) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate, former commander of United States Central Command, 
        General James Mattis (retired), stated, ``We have lived too 
        long in a strategy-free mode . . . America needs a refreshed 
        national strategy . . . And our Nation's strategy demands a 
        comprehensive approach.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Islamic extremism is growing in the Middle East and 
        elsewhere;
            (2) Iran continues to be a leading state sponsor of 
        terrorism in the Middle East and across the globe and continues 
        to actively work against United States interests;
            (3) the threat of terrorist attacks in the United States 
        and threats against United States interests have increased due 
        to the growth of Islamic extremism, the proliferation of 
        terrorist groups across the world, and the instability in the 
        Middle East in countries such as Libya, Yemen, Iraq, and Syria;
            (4) the approach of Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) and 
        conducting limited counterterrorism operations has had some 
        positive effects in some locations, but has not prevented the 
        proliferation and violence of terrorist groups or instability 
        in the Middle East;
            (5) the United States should articulate, develop, and 
        implement an effective strategy to work with its allies and 
        partners to defeat Islamic extremist groups that threaten the 
        interests of the Unites States and its allies;
            (6) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with

        combat search and rescue support requirements, and the 
        associated measures that are being taken to support such 
        requirements, in order to ensure that such requirements and 
        associated measures are sufficient given the operating 
        environment and optimally postured.

            (1) March 2015 marked the fourth year of the crisis in 
        Syria, which has resulted in the world's largest ongoing

            (2) Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and supporting

        including thousands of children, many more have been seriously 
        wounded, and civilian casualties continue to mount as 
        widespread and systematic attacks on schools, hospitals, and

            (4) Assad's forces and supporting militias have used air 
        power to target Syrian civilians, including the deployment of 
        barrel bombs filled with explosives, shrapnel, and chemical 
        weapons.
            (5) Assad's forces, supporting militias, and other parties

SEC. 1232. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR 
              PROGRAM AND ITS MALIGN MILITARY ACTIVITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The understanding announced on April 2, 2015, between 
        the countries of the P5+1 (the United States, the United 
        Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China) and Iran on a 
        Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action (CJPOA) provides sanctions 
        relief in exchange for constraints on Iran's nuclear program 
        for a limited period of time.
            (2) Iran continues to develop ballistic missiles in 
        violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1747 
        (2007) and 1929 (2010), has developed medium-range ballistic 
        missiles to target Israel and other United States allies, is 
        working towards an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 
        capability and the CJPOA places no limitations on Iran's 
        ballistic and cruise missile development efforts.
            (3) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a state-
        sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and for the past decade has 
        characterized Iran as the ``most active state sponsor of 
        terrorism'' in the world.
            (4) Iran continues to support Hezbollah in Lebanon, the 
        Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, Shia militias in Iraq, Hamas 
        in Gaza, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and other terrorist 
        organizations and extremists globally.
            (5) Iran continues to conduct malign military activities 
        across the Middle East and around the globe, which has and will 
        continue to destabilize the region. As the Commander of United 
        States Central Command testified to the Committee on Armed 
        Services of the House of Representatives on March 3, 2015, 
        ``the leaders in the region. . . are also equally concerned 
        about Iran's ability to mine the Straits, Iran's cyber 
        capabilities, Iran's. . . ballistic missile capability, as well 
        as the activity of their Quds forces... And so whether we get a 
        deal or don't get a deal, I think they will still share those 
        concerns.''.
            (6) Iran's destabilizing activities throughout the region 
        pose a threat to United States interests, the interests of 
        United States allies in the region, and international security.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Iran's illicit pursuit, development, or acquisition of 
        a nuclear weapons capability and its malign military activities 
        overall constitute a grave threat to regional stability and the 
        national security interests of the United States and its allies 
        and partners;
            (2) Iran continues to expand its malign activities in the 
        Middle East and globally, which may well increase under a 
        CJPOA;
            (3) sanctions relief under the CJPOA will provide Iran the 
        ability to increase funding for its ballistic missile 
        development programs, acquisition of destabilizing types and 
        amounts of conventional weapons, support for terrorism, and 
        other malign activities throughout the Middle East and 
        globally;
            (4) United States bilateral and multilateral sanctions 
        against Iran, once relieved, will be extremely difficult to 
        reconstitute in response to Iranian violations of its 
        international obligations;
            (5) Iran would be an internationally-approved nuclear-
        threshold state under the framework of the CJPOA, which will 
        likely lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the 
        Middle East;
            (6) Congress should review and assess all elements of any 
        agreement entered into between the countries of the P5+1 and 
        Iran and it should approve or disapprove of any sanctions 
        relief that results from such an agreement;
            (7) the United States must continue to support the defense 
        of allies and partners in the region, including Israel, 
        strengthening ballistic missile defense capabilities, and 
        increasing security assistance;
            (8) Congress supports efforts to reach a peaceful, 
        diplomatic solution to permanently and verifiably end Iran's 
        pursuit, development, and acquisition of a nuclear weapons 
        capability, and it reaffirms that it is United States policy 
        that Iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapons 
        capability and that all instruments of United States power must 
        be considered to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon;
            (9) Congress reaffirms the rights of United States allies 
        to exercise their legitimate right to self-defense against the 
        Government of Iran;
            (10) the sale of advanced weaponry to Iran, particularly 
        advanced air defenses, encourages bad behavior by Iran and 
        poses a high risk of destabilizing the region and should be 
        opposed; and
            (11) no terrorism-related sanctions should be lifted or 
        loosened as a part of any nuclear agreement and additional 
        sanctions should be considered against Iran due to Iran's 
        continued state sponsorship of terrorism, its development and 
        proliferation of ballistic missile technology, its continued 
        biological and chemical weapons programs, and the egregious 
        violation of the human rights of the Iranian people.

SEC. 1243. NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION WITH ITS 
              OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INF TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of State, on July 31, 2014, released the 
        Annual Report on the ``Adherence to and Compliance With Arms 
        Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and 
        Commitments'' which included the finding that, ``The United 
        States has determined that the Russian Federation is in 
        violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty not to 
        possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise 
        missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km, 
        or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.''.
            (2) According to the testimony of senior officials of the 
        Department of State, the Russian Federation is not complying 
        with numerous treaties and agreements, including the INF 
        Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty, the Biological Weapons 
        Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Vienna 
        Document, the Budapest Memorandum, the Istanbul Commitments, 
        the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, the Missile Technology 
        Control Regime, and the Russian Federation has recently 
        withdrawn from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in 
        Europe (CFE).
            (3) The Commander of U.S. European Command, and Supreme 
        Allied Commander of Europe, General Philip Breedlove, USAF, 
        stated that ``[a] weapon capability that violates the I.N.F., 
        that is introduced into the greater European land mass is 
        absolutely a tool that will have to be dealt with . . . I would 
        not judge how the alliance will choose to react, but I would 
        say they will have to consider what to do about it, [i]t can't 
        go unanswered.''.
            (4) General Breedlove has further stated that `` we need to 
        first and foremost signal that we cannot accept this change and 
        that, if this change is continued, that we will have to change 
        the cost calculus for Russia in order to help them to find 
        their way to a less bellicose position.''.
            (5) General Martin Dempsey, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff 
        testified that, ``I think we have to make it very clear that 
        things like their compliance with the INF treaty that there 
        will be political, diplomatic and potentially military costs in 
        terms of the way we posture ourselves and the way we plan and 
        work with our allies to address those provocations. . .It 
        concerns me greatly. I certainly would counsel them not to roll 
        back the clock.''.
            (6) The Secretary of Defense, Ashton B. Carter, testified 
        that, ``On the military side, we have begun to consider . . . 
        what our options are, because the INF treaty is a treaty, 
        meaning that it's a two-way street. We accepted constraints in 
        return for constraints of the then Soviet Union. It is a two-
        way street, and we need to remind them that it's a two-way 
        street, meaning that we, without an INF treaty, can take action 
        also that we both decided years ago was best for neither of us 
        to take.''.
            (7) The Department of Defense has been considering a range 
        of military options to respond to the Russian Federation's 
        violation of the INF Treaty and these options would ``aim to 
        negate any advantage Russia might gain from deploying an INF-
        prohibited system, and all of these would be designed to make 
        us more secure'', and these options ``fall into three broad 
        categories: active defenses to counter intermediate-range 
        ground-launched cruise missiles; counterforce capabilities to 
        prevent intermediate-range ground-launched cruise missile 
        attacks; and countervailing strike capabilities to enhance U.S. 
        or allied forces.''.
            (8) President Barack Obama stated in Prague in 2009 that, 
        ``Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words 
        must mean something.''.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Russian Federation should return to compliance with 
        the INF Treaty;
            (2) the continuing violation of the INF Treaty by the 
        Russian Federation threatens the viability of the INF Treaty;
            (3) the United States has reportedly been undertaking 
        diplomatic efforts to address with the Russia Federation its 
        violations of the INF Treaty since 2013, and the Russian 
        Federation has failed to respond to these efforts in any 
        meaningful way;
            (4) not only should the Russian Federation end its cheating 
        with respect to the INF Treaty, but also its illegal occupation 
        of the sovereign territory of another nation, its plans for 
        stationing nuclear weapons on that nation's territory, and its 
        cheating and violation of as many as eight of its 12 arms 
        control obligations and agreements; and
            (5) there are several United States military requirements 
        that would be addressed by the development and deployment of 
        systems currently prohibited by the INF Treaty.
    (c) Notification of Russian Violations of INF Treaty.--
            (1) In general.--The President shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a notification of--
                    (A) whether the Russian Federation has flight-
                tested, deployed, or possesses a military system that 
                has achieved an initial operating capability of a 
                covered missile system; and
                    (B) whether the Russian Federation has begun steps 
                to return to full compliance with the INF Treaty, 
                including by agreeing to inspections and verification 
                measures necessary to achieve high confidence that any 
                covered missile system will be eliminated, as required 
                by the INF Treaty upon its entry into force.
            (2) Deadline.--The notification required under paragraph 
        (1) shall be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act and not later than 30 days after the 
        date on which the Russian Federation meets any of the 
        requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1).
            (3) Form.--The notification required under paragraph (1) 
        shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a 
        classified annex if necessary.

Treaty.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment, and every 120-day period thereafter for a period 
        of 5 years, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the 
        Joint Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the Secretary of 
        State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall jointly 
        submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        notification on the status and content of updates provided to 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and allies of the 
        United States in East Asia, on the Russian Federation's flight 
        testing, operating capability and deployment of a covered 
        missile system, including updates on the status and a 
        description of efforts with such allies to develop collective 
        responses, including economic and military responses, to the 
        Russian Federation's arms control violations, including 
        violations of the INF Treaty.
            (2) Form.--The notification required under paragraph (1) 
        shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a 
        classified annex if necessary.
    (e) Military Response Options to Russian Federation Violation of 
the Treaty on Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces.--
            (1) Development of capabilities.--If, as of the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the President determines that the 
        Russian Federation has not begun steps to return to full 
        compliance with the INF Treaty, including by agreeing to 
        inspections and verification measures necessary to achieve high 
        confidence that any covered missile system will be eliminated, 
        as required by the INF Treaty upon its entry into force, the 
        President shall begin developing the following military 
        capabilities:
                    (A) Counterforce capabilities to prevent 
                intermediate-range ground-launched ballistic missile 
                and cruise missile attacks, including capabilities that 
                may be acquired from allies.
                    (B) Countervailing strike capabilities to enhance 
                the Armed Forces of the United States or allies of the 
                United States, including capabilities that may be 
                acquired from allies.
            (2) Availability of funds for recommended capabilities.--
        The Secretary of Defense may use funds authorized to be 
        appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal 
        year 2016 for research, development, test, and evaluation, 
        Defense-wide, as specified in the funding table in section 
        4201, to carry out the development of capabilities pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) that are recommended by the Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff to meet military requirements and current 
        capability gaps. In making such a selection, the Chairman shall 
        give priority to such capabilities that the Chairman determines 
        could be tested and fielded most expediently, with the most 
        priority given to capabilities that the Chairman determines 
        could be fielded in two years.
            (3) Reports on development.--
                    (A) In general.--During each 180-day period 
                beginning on the date on which funds are first 
                obligated to develop capabilities under paragraph (2), 
                the Chairman shall submit to the appropriate 
                congressional committees a report on such capabilities, 
                including the costs of development (and estimated total 
                costs of each system if pursued to deployment) and the 
                timeline for development flight testing and deployment.
                    (B) Sunset.--The provisions of subparagraph (A) 
                shall not be in effect on and after the date on which 
                the President certifies to the appropriate 
                congressional committees that the INF Treaty is no 
                longer in force or the Russian Federation has fully 
                returned to compliance with its obligations under the 
                INF Treaty.
            (4) Report on deployment.--Not later than 180 days after

                    (A) Potential deployment locations of the military 
                capabilities described in paragraph (1) in East Asia 
                and Eastern Europe, including any potential basing 
                agreements that may be required to facilitate such 
                deployments.
                    (B) Any required safety and security measures, 
                estimates of potential costs of deployments described 
                in subparagraph (A) and an assessment of whether or not

              MODIFY OR INTRODUCE NEW AIRCRAFT OR SENSORS FOR FLIGHT BY 
              THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION UNDER OPEN SKIES TREATY.

SEC. 1245. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND 
              LITHUANIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are 
        highly valued allies of the United States, and they have 
        repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to advancing our 
        mutual interests as well as those of the NATO Alliance.
            (2) Operation Atlantic Resolve is a series of exercises and 
        coordinating efforts meant to demonstrate the United States' 
        commitment to the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and 
        Lithuania, and the United States-Baltic partnership's shared 
        goal of peace and stability in the region. Built upon the 
        common values of peace, stability and prosperity, Operation 
        Atlantic Resolve strengthens communication and understanding, 
        and is an important effort to deter Russian aggression against 
        the Baltic States.
            (3) As part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, the European 
        Reassurance Initiative undertakes exercises, training, and 
        rotational presence necessary to reassure and integrate our 
        Baltic State allies into a common defense framework.
            (4) All three Baltic States contributed to the NATO-led 
        International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, sending 
        disproportionate numbers of troops and operating with few 
        caveats. They also continue to engage in the Resolute Support 
        Mission in Afghanistan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its support for the principle of collective 
        defense as enshrined in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        for our NATO allies, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania;
            (2) supports the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
        integrity, and inviolability of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
        as well as their internationally recognized borders, and 
        expresses concerns over increasingly aggressive military 
        maneuvering by Russia near their borders and airspace;
            (3) expresses concerns over increasingly aggressive 
        military maneuvering by the Russian Federation near Baltic 
        state borders and airspace, and condemns reported subversive 
        and destabilizing activities by the Russian Federation within 
        the Baltic states; and
            (4) encourages the Administration to further enhance 
        defense cooperation efforts with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
        and supports the efforts of their Governments to provide for 
        the defense of their people and sovereign territory.

SEC. 1246. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR GEORGIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Georgia is a valued friend of the United States and has 
        repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to advancing the mutual 
        interests of both countries, including the deployment of 
        Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led International Security 
        Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and the Multi-National 
        Force in Iraq.
            (2) The European Reassurance Initiative builds the 
        partnership capacity of Georgia so it can work more closely 
        with the United States and NATO, as well as provide for their 
        own defense.
            (3) In addition to the European Reassurance Initiative, 
        Georgia's participation in the NATO initiative Partnership for 
        Peace is paramount to interoperability with the United States 
        and NATO, and establishing a more peaceful environment in the 
        region.
            (4) Despite the heavy and painful losses suffered during 
        the ISAF, as a NATO partner Georgia is engaged in the Resolute 
        Support Mission in Afghanistan with the second largest 
        contingent on the ground.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms United States support for Georgia's 
        sovereignty and territorial integrity within its 
        internationally-recognized borders, and does not recognize the 
        Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions, currently occupied by 
        Russia, as independent; and
            (2) supports continued cooperation between the United 
        States and Georgia and the efforts of the Government of Georgia 
        to provide for the defense of its people and sovereign 
        territory.

SEC. 1247. PROHIBITION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS RELATING TO SOVEREIGNTY 
              OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OVER CRIMEA.

    (a) In General.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by 
this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2016 for the

            (1) to implement any action or policy that recognizes the 
        de jure or de facto sovereignty of the Russian Federation over 
        Crimea, its airspace, or its territorial waters; or
            (2) to provide assistance for the central government of a 
        country that has taken affirmative steps intended to recognize 
        or otherwise be supportive of the Russian Federation's forcible 
        and illegal occupation of Crimea.
    (b) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense may waive the restriction on 
assistance required by subsection (a)(2) if the Secretary certifies and

Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives that to do 
so is in the national interest of the United States.
    (c) Sunset.--The requirements of subsection (a) shall cease to be 
in effect if the Secretary of Defense certifies and reports to the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed 
Services of the House of Representatives that the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation have withdrawn from Crimea and the Government of 
Ukraine has reestablished sovereignty over Crimea.

SEC. 1248. LIMITATION ON MILITARY CONTACT AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 
              UNITED STATES AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.

    (a) Limitation.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2016 for the Department of 
Defense may be used for any bilateral military-to-military contact or 
cooperation between the Governments of the United States and the 
Russian Federation until the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with 
the Secretary of State, certifies to the appropriate congressional 
committees that--
            (1) the armed forces of the Russian Federation are no 
        longer illegally occupying Ukrainian territory;
            (2) the Russian Federation is respecting the sovereignty of 
        all Ukrainian territory;
            (3) the Russian Federation is no longer taking actions that 
        are inconsistent with the INF Treaty; and
            (4) the Russian Federation has not sold or otherwise 
        transferred the Club-K land attack cruise missile system to any 
        foreign country or foreign person during fiscal year 2015.
    (b) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense may waive the limitation in

        Subtitle F--Matters Relating to the Asia-Pacific Region

SEC. 1251. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
              END OF ALLIED MILITARY ENGAGEMENT IN THE PACIFIC THEATER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings
            (1) September 2, 2015, marks the 70th anniversary of the 
        end of Allied military engagement in the Pacific theater, also 
        marking the end of the Second World War.
            (2) The United States entered the Second World War in 
        December 1941, following the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl 
        Harbor, and over the next four years Americans participated in 
        what was arguably the greatest national endeavor in the 
        Nation's history.
            (3) The casualty toll of Americans in the Pacific theater 
        during the Second World War was approximately 92,904 killed, 
        208,333 wounded, and tens of thousands missing in action and 
        prisoners of war, with civilians and military forces of the 
        Allied Powers suffering equally devastating tolls.
            (4) American military forces displayed extraordinary 
        courage and suffered significant casualties in battles across 
        the Pacific theater, including in the Battle of the Philippine 
        Sea, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Philippines Campaign, the 
        Battle of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa.
            (5) Japanese military forces and the Japanese civilian 
        population also suffered staggering losses.
            (6) On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced 
        the unconditional surrender of Japan's military forces, made 
        formal on September 2, 1945, aboard the U.S.S. Missouri in 
        Tokyo Bay, Japan, thus ending the most devastating war in human 
        history.
            (7) Japan is now a free and prosperous democracy; a valued 
        ally with shared values and mutual interests based on the 
        principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of 
        law, who serves as a cornerstone for peace and security in the 
        region and for whom the United States seeks to further enhance 
        security, economic, and diplomatic ties.
            (8) The bravery and sacrifice of the members of the United 
        States Armed Forces and the military forces of the Allied 
        Powers who served valiantly to rescue the Pacific nations from 
        tyranny and aggression should be always remembered.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the end of Allied 
        military engagement in the Pacific theater, and also marking 
        the end of Second World War;
            (2) joins with a grateful nation in expressing respect and 
        appreciation to the members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who served in the Pacific theater during the Second World War;
            (3) remembers and honors those Americans who made the 
        ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives for their country 
        during the campaigns in the Pacific theater during the Second 
        World War; and
            (4) preserves and applies the lessons learned from the 
        history of the Second World War in the Pacific theater and 
        recognizes the close alliance between the United States and 
        Japan, codified in the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and 
        Security between the United States and Japan, that continues to 
        be enhanced to maintain peace and prosperity in the region.

SEC. 1252. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONSOLIDATION OF UNITED STATES 
              MILITARY FACILITIES IN OKINAWA, JAPAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The defense alliance between the United States and 
        Japan remains important and strong.
            (2) Progress continues to be made in the United States and 
        Japan to fulfill the April 27, 2012, agreement of the United 
        States-Japan Security Consultative Committee that modified the 
        United States-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation, 
        originally codified on May 1, 2006, including the Governor of 
        Okinawa signing the landfill permit for Henoko construction on 
        December 27, 2013, and the elimination of restrictions on 
        Government of Japan contributions for the realignment of Marine 
        Corps forces in the Asia-Pacific region by section 2821 of the 
        Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 
        (division B of Public Law 113-291).
            (3) The Government of Japan has made significant and 
        unprecedented direct financial contributions of more than 
        $3,000,000,000 to the Support for United States Relocation to 
        Guam Account pursuant to section 2350k of title 10, United 
        States Code, for the relocation of Marine Corps forces from 
        Okinawa to Guam and the relocation of certain training from 
        Okinawa to the Marianas region, of which nearly $1,000,000,000 
        has already been received from the Government of Japan, and a 
        significant amount of these funds has already been obligated 
        and expended to support the relocation of Marine Corps forces 
        on Guam.
            (4) It is important to return formerly used United States 
        military property in Okinawa to the local government.
            (5) Consolidation of United States facilities and the 
        return of formerly used United States military property in 
        Okinawa will be implemented as soon as possible, while ensuring 
        operational capability, including training capability, 
        throughout the consolidation process.
            (6) Under the April 27, 2012, agreement referred to in 
        paragraph (2), the United States is authorized to establish 
        Marine Air-Ground Task Forces at additional locations in the 
        Asia-Pacific region, including Guam, Hawaii, and Australia, 
        which will enhance their readiness posture through flexibility 
        and speed to respond to regional threats and maintain regional 
        peace, stability, and security.
            (7) Even though realignment of Marine Corps forces from 
        Okinawa to Guam is ``de-linked'' from progress on the 
        construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility in Henoko, 
        there must be continued progress on Guam and Okinawa to meet 
        the agreement.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Henoko 
location for the Futenma Replacement Facility--
            (1) has been studied and analyzed for several decades, 
        reaffirmed by both the United States and Japan on several 
        occasions, including the 2010 Futenma Replacement Facility 
        Bilateral Experts study and the independent assessment required 
        by section 346 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1373); and
            (2) remains the only option for the Futenma Replacement 
        Facility.

        Act, 2014 (division K of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
        2014 (Public Law 113-76)).

        Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall take 
        into consideration the strategy developed under subsection (a) 
        and the Presidential Policy Directive issued under subsection 
        (b).
            (2) Annual budget.--The President, acting through the 
        Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall ensure 
        that the annual budget submitted to Congress under section 1105 
        of title 31, United States Code, includes a separate section 
        that clearly highlights programs and projects that are being 
        funded in the annual budget that relate to the strategy 
        developed under subsection (a) and the Presidential Policy 
        Directive issued under subsection (b).

SEC. 1254. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES ALLIANCE WITH JAPAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States highly values its alliance with the 
        Government of Japan as a cornerstone of peace and security in 
        the region, based on shared values of democracy, the rule of 
        law, free and open markets, and respect for human rights in

        prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;

        security;
            (3) the United States supports recent changes in Japanese 
        defense policy, including the adoption of collective self-
        defense and the new bilateral Guidelines for U.S.-Japan Defense 
        Cooperation which were approved on April 27, 2015, and will 
        promote a more balanced and effective alliance to meet the 
        emerging security challenges of this century;
            (4) the United States and Japan should continue to improve 
        joint interoperability and collaborate on developing future 
        capabilities with which to maintain regional stability in an 
        increasingly uncertain security environment;
            (5) the United States and Japan should continue efforts to

        Government of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual 
        Cooperation and Security that ``[e]ach Party recognizes that an 
        armed attack against either Party in the territories under the 
        administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and 
        safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger 
        in accordance with its constitutional provisions and 
        processes''.

SEC. 1255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE THE UNITED 
              STATES ALLIANCE WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the alliance between the United States and the Republic 
        of Korea has served as an anchor for stability, security, and 
        prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asia-Pacific region, 
        and around the world;
            (2) the United States and the Republic of Korea continue to 
        strengthen and adapt the comprehensive strategic alliance of 
        bilateral, regional, and global scope to serve as a linchpin of 
        peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, recognizing the 
        shared values of democracy, human rights, free and open market, 
        and the rule of law, as reaffirmed in the May 2013 ``Joint 
        Declaration in Commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the 
        Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of 
        America'';
            (3) the United States and the Republic of Korea continue to 
        broaden and deepen the scope and level of alliance cooperation 
        by strengthening the combined defense posture on the Korean 
        Peninsula, enhancing mutual security based on the Republic of 
        Korea-United States Mutual Defense Treaty, and promoting 
        cooperation for regional and global security in the 21st 
        century, recognizing the significance of 2015 as it marks the 
        70th anniversary of the end of World War II;
            (4) the United States and the Republic of Korea share deep 
        concerns that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missiles 
        programs and its repeated provocations pose grave threats to 
        peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia 
        and recognize that both nations are determined to achieve the 
        peaceful denuclearization of North Korea, and remain fully 
        committed to continuing close cooperation on the full range of 
        issues related to North Korea;

        market principles, as articulated in President Park's Dresden 
        address; and
            (6) the United States and the Republic of Korea share the

SEC. 1256. REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY REGARDING 
              FOREIGN DISCLOSURE OR TECHNOLOGY RELEASE OF AEGIS ASHORE 
              CAPABILITY TO ALLIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a decision 
by the Government of Japan to purchase Aegis Ashore for its self-
defense, given that it already possesses sea-based Aegis weapons 
system-equipped naval vessels, could create a significant opportunity 
for promoting interoperability and integration of air- and missile 
defense capability with close allies, could provide for force 
multiplication benefits, and could potentially alleviate force posture 
requirements on multi-mission assets.
    (b) Requirement to Submit Policy.--Not later than 30 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a copy of the 
Department of Defense policy regarding foreign disclosure or technology 
release of Aegis Ashore capability to allies, including Japan, that 
possess sea-based Aegis weapons system-equipped naval vessels.
    (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate 
congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the congressional defense committees; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and 
        the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives.

forces of Taiwan to participate in any maritime exercise known as the 
Rim of the Pacific Exercise if the Secretary has invited the military 
forces of the People's Republic of China to participate in such 
maritime exercise.
    (b) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act and applies with respect to any maritime exercise 
described in subsection (a) that begins on or after such date of 
enactment.

SEC. 1267. UNITED STATES-ISRAEL ANTI-TUNNEL DEFENSE COOPERATION.

    (a) Findings and Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Tunnels have been used for centuries around the 
                world as a means of avoiding detection or circumventing 
                defenses.
                    (B) Tunnels can be used for criminal purposes, such 
                as smuggling drugs, weapons, or humans, or for 
                terrorist or military purposes, such as launching 
                surprise attacks or detonating explosives underneath 
                infrastructure.
                    (C) Tunnels have been a growing threat on the 
                southern border of the United States for more than 11 
                years, and the Department of Homeland Security has been 
                working to address this threat.
                    (D) The conflict in Gaza in 2014 showed that 
                terrorists are now actively using tunnels as a means of 
                attack, and news reports indicate that tunnels are 
                being used in Syria as well.
                    (E) Terrorist organizations are quick to adopt 
                successful tactics, and it is only a matter of time 
                before other terrorist organizations begin using 
                tunnels.
                    (F) The facilities of the United States, and those 
                of the allies of the United States, could be under 
                threat very quickly if tunnel threats continue to 
                proliferate.
                    (G) Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Palestinian Islamic 
                Jihad are United States-designated terrorist 
                organizations.
                    (H) Designated Palestinian terrorist organizations 
                have killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of 
                Americans in rocket attacks and suicide bombings.
                    (I) Hamas has used underground tunnels to Israel 
                and Egypt to smuggle weapons, money, and supplies into 
                Gaza and to send members of Hamas out of Gaza for 
                training and to bring trainers in to Gaza to teach 
                Hamas how to manufacture rockets and build better 
                tunnels. Tunnels in Gaza have also been used as 
                underground rocket launching sites, weapons caches, 
                bunkers, transportation networks and command and 
                control centers.
                    (J) In 2006, Hamas kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad 
                Shalit through a tunnel and held him for five years.
                    (K) The Israel Defense Forces discovered 32 tunnels 
                during the conflict with Hamas in the summer of 2014, 
                14 of which crossed into Israel.
                    (L) Hamas intentionally uses civilians as human 
                shields by placing its underground tunnel network in 
                densely populated areas and schools, hospitals, and 
                mosques.
                    (M) Hamas's placement of explosive material in its 
                vast network of tunnels in Gaza has caused civilian 
                casualties through secondary and tertiary explosions.
                    (N) While the unemployment rate in Gaza is at 38 
                percent, it is estimated that Hamas spends $3,000,000 
                per tunnel.
                    (O) United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 
                said he was ``shocked by the tunnels used for the 
                infiltration of terrorists''.
                    (P) Hamas has claimed to be rebuilding tunnels in 
                Gaza after the war with Israel in the summer of 2014.
                    (Q) Hezbollah has used underground tunnels in 
                southern Lebanon to move Hezbollah fighters and to 
                launch attacks.
                    (R) The Palestinian Islamic Jihad claims to be 
                digging new tunnels on the Gaza border. Israel has a 
                right to defend itself from the violence of Palestinian 
                terrorist groups, including the violence that is 
                facilitated through terrorist tunnel networks.
                    (S) The United States is working cooperatively with 
                the Government of Israel to develop technologies to 
                detect and neutralize tunnels penetrating the territory 
                of Israel.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) it is in the best interests of the United 
                States to develop technology to detect and counter 
                tunnels, and the best way to do this is to partner with 
                other affected countries; and
                    (B) Israel is facing serious threats posed by 
                tunnels and should be the first partner of the United 
                States in addressing this significant challenge.
    (b) Assistance to Israel to Establish an Anti-tunneling Defense 
System.--
            (1) In general.--The President, upon request of the 
        Government of Israel, is authorized to carry out research, 
        development, and test activities on a joint basis with Israel 
        to establish an anti-tunneling defense system to detect, map, 
        and neutralize underground tunnels into and directed at the 
        territory of Israel.
            (2) Certification.--None of the funds authorized to be 
        appropriated to carry out this section may be obligated or 
        expended to carry out subsection (a) until the President 
        certifies to Congress the following:
                    (A) The President has finalized a memorandum of 
                understanding or other formal agreement between the

                paragraph (1).
                    (B) The understanding or agreement--
                            (i) requires sharing of costs of projects, 
                        including the cost of claims and in-kind 
                        support, between the United States and Israel 
                        on an equitable basis unless the President 
                        determines, on a case-by-case basis, the 
                        Government of Israel is unable to contribute on 
                        an equitable basis;
                            (ii) requires the designation of payment of 
                        non-recurring engineering costs in connection 
                        with the establishment of a capacity for co-
                        production in the United States;
                            (iii) establishes a framework to negotiate 
                        the rights to any intellectual property 
                        developed under the cooperative research and 
                        development projects; and
                            (iv) requires the United States Government 
                        to receive quarterly reports on expenditure of 
                        funds by the Government of Israel, including a 
                        description of what the funds have been used 
                        for, when funds were expended, and an 
                        identification of entities that expended the 
                        funds.
            (3) Assistance.--The President, upon request of the 
        Government of Israel, is authorized to provide assistance to 
        Israel for the procurement, maintenance, and sustainment of an 
        anti-tunneling system described in paragraph (1).
    (c) Assistance to Other Allies to Establish an Anti-tunneling 
Defense System.--In addition to the memorandum of understanding or

SEC. 1268. EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO PREVENT AND RESPOND 
              TO GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE GLOBALLY.

    (a) Findings and Statement of Policy.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Gender-based violence reaches every corner of 
                the world, affecting millions of people ever year and 
                one in three women in her lifetime. This epidemic not 
                only undermines the safety, dignity, and human rights 
                of the individual, family and community, it affects 
                public health, economic stability, and security of 
                nations, which in turn has a direct impact upon United 
                States foreign policy, defense interests, democracy, 
                governance, and peace-building efforts.
                    (B) With one of the largest international 
                footprints in the United States government, the 
                Department of Defense is an integral part of combating 
                the epidemic of gender-based violence, especially in 
                conflict regions.
                    (C) Section 7061 of the Joint Explanatory Statement 
                of the Committee of Conference accompanying the 
                Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 directed the 
                Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United 
                States Agency for International Development to develop 
                and submit to Congress a multi-year strategy to prevent 
                and respond to gender-based violence.
                    (D) Executive Order No. 13623 of August 10, 2012 
                (77 Fed. Reg. 49345) established the United States 
                Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based 
                Violence Globally, which required the Department of 
                Defense to participate in an Interagency Working Group 
                co-chaired by the Department of State and the United 
                States Agency for International Development to 
                implement the Strategy.
                    (E) The Joint Explanatory Statement of the 
                Committee of Conference accompanying the National 
                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 
                3979, Public Law 113-291), encouraged the Department of 
                Defense to support the continued implementation of the 
                United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to 
                Gender-Based Violence Globally and to participate in 
                the Interagency Working Group.
                    (F) Executive Order No. 13623 requires within 3 
                years of August 12, 2012, that the Interagency Working 
                Group shall complete a final evaluation of the Strategy 
                and within 180 days of completing its final evaluation, 
                the Interagency Working Group shall update or revise 
                the Strategy to take into account the information 
                learned and the progress made during and through the 
                implementation of the Strategy.
            (2) Statement of policy.--It is in the national security 
        interest of the United States to--
                    (A) prevent gender-based violence which will 
                promote regional and global stability and advance 
                sustainable peace and security;
                    (B) have a multi-year strategy in place that will

    Subtitle C--European Reassurance Initiative and Related Matters

SEC. 1531. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING EUROPEAN REASSURANCE 
              INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In February 2015, Lieutenant General James Clapper 
        (retired), Director of National Intelligence, testified to the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``Russian 
        dominance over the former Soviet space is Russia's highest 
        foreign policy goal''.
            (2) Russia, under the direction of President Vladimir 
        Putin, has demonstrated its intent to expand its sphere of 
        influence beyond its borders and limit Western influence in the 
        region.
            (3) The Russian military is aggressively postured on the 
        Ukrainian boarder and continues its buildup of military 
        personnel and material. These aggressive and unwarranted 
        actions serve to intimidate, with a show of force, the 
        Ukrainian people as well as the other nations in the region 
        including Georgia, the Baltic States, and the Balkan States.
            (4) In December 2014, Congress enacted the Ukraine Freedom 
        Support Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-272), which gives the 
        President the authority to expand assistance to Ukraine, 
        increase economic sanctions on Russia, and provide equipment to 
        counter offensive weapons.
            (5) In February 2015, the Atlantic Council, the Brookings 
        Institute, and the Chicago Council on Global Affairs published 
        a report entitled ``Preserving Ukraine's Independence, 
        Resisting Russian Aggression: What the United States and NATO 
        Must Do'' advocating for increased United States assistance to 
        Ukraine with nonlethal and lethal defensive equipment.
            (6) Despite Russia signing the February 2015 Minsk 
        Agreement, it has continued to violate the terms of the 
        agreement, as noted by Assistant Secretary of State for 
        European and Eurasian Affairs, Victoria Nuland, at the German 
        Marshall Fund Brussels Forum in March 2015: ``We've seen month 
        on month, more lethal weaponry of a higher caliber...poured 
        into Ukraine by the separatist Russian allies...the number one 
        thing is for Russia to stop sending arms over the border so we 
        can have real politics.''.
            (7) The military of the Russian Federation continues to 
        increase their show of force globally, including frequent 
        international military flights, frequent snap exercises of 
        thousands of Russian troops, increased global naval presence, 
        and the threat of the use of nuclear weapons in defense of the 
        annexation of Crimea in March 2014.
            (8) The Government of the Russian Federation continues to 
        exert and increase undue influence on the free will of 
        sovereign nations and people with intimidation tactics, covert 
        operations, cyber warfare, and other unconventional methods.
            (9) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        House of Representatives in February 2015, Commander of 
        European Command, General Philip Breedlove, United States Air 
        Force, stated that ``Russia has employed `hybrid warfare'...to 
        illegally seize Crimea, foment separatist fever in several 
        sovereign nations, and maintain frozen conflicts within its so-
        called `sphere of influence' or `near abroad'''.
            (10) The use of unconventional methods of warfare by Russia 
        presents challenges to the United States and its partners and 
        allies in addressing the threat.
            (11) An enhanced United States military presence and 
        readiness posture and the provision of security assistance in 
        Europe are key elements to deterring further Russian aggression 
        and reassuring United States allies and partners.
            (12) In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291), Congress authorized and 
        appropriated $1 billion for the European Reassurance 
        Initiative, which supports Operation Atlantic Resolve of the 
        United States Armed Forces.
            (13) The European Reassurance Initiative expands United 
        States military presence in Europe, through--
                    (A) bolstered and continual United States military 
                presence;
                    (B) bilateral and multilateral exercises with 
                partners and allies;
                    (C) improved infrastructure;
                    (D) increased prepositioning of United States 
                equipment throughout Europe; and
                    (E) building partnership capacity for allies and 
                partners.
            (14) The European Reassurance Initiative has served as a 
        valuable tool in strengthening the partnerships with the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as partnerships 
        with non-member allies in the region.
            (15) As a result of the NATO 2014 Summit in Wales, NATO has 
        initiated a Readiness Action Plan to increase partner nation 
        funding and resourcing to combat Russian aggression. NATO's 
        efforts with the Readiness Action Plan and United States 
        investment in regional security through the European 
        Reassurance Initiative will serve to continue and reinforce the 
        strength and fortitude of the alliance against nefarious 
        actors.
            (16) The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 2016 
        includes $789.3 million to continue the European Reassurance 
        Initiative focus on increased United States military troop 
        rotations in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve, maintaining 
        and further expanding increasing regional exercises, and 
        building partnership capacity.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
continue and expand its efforts in Europe to reassure United States 
allies and partners and deter further aggression and intimidation by 
the Russian Government, in order to enhance security and stability in 
the region. This policy shall include--
            (1) continued use of conventional methods, including 
        increased United States military presence in Europe, exercises 
        and training with allies and partners, increasing 
        infrastructure, prepositioning of United States military 
        equipment in Europe, and building partnership capacity;
            (2) increased emphasis on countering unconventional warfare 
        methods in areas such as cyber warfare, economic warfare, 
        information operations, and intelligence operations, including 
        increased efforts in the development of strategy, operational 
        concepts, capabilities, and technologies; and
            (3) increased security assistance to allies and partners in 
        Europe, including the provision of both non-lethal equipment 
        and lethal equipment of a defensive nature to Ukraine.

SEC. 1606. ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of the Air Force needs to develop an 
        updated phased acquisition strategy and contracting plan for 
        the evolved expendable launch vehicle program;
            (2) beyond the contractual requirements as of the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, in recognition of the emerging 
        competitive environment, the acquisition strategy and 
        contracting plan should eliminate the currently structured 
        evolved expendable launch vehicle launch capability 
        arrangement;
            (3) in further recognition of the emerging competitive 
        environment, the Secretary should acquire launch services in a 
        manner consistent with a full and open competition;
            (4) the Secretary should be consistent and fair with 
        evolved expendable launch vehicle providers regarding the 
        requirement for certified cost and pricing data, selection of 
        contract types, and the appropriate audits to protect the 
        taxpayer; and
            (5) the Secretary should--
                    (A) consider various contracting approaches, 
                including launch capability arrangements with multiple 
                certified providers, to meet the objectives identified 
                in the acquisition strategy developed under subsection 
                (d); and
                    (B) continue to provide the necessary stability in 
                budgeting and acquisition of capabilities as well as 
                the flexibility to the Federal Government to 
                appropriately manage the launch manifest in case of 
                delays in the delivery of satellites or other changes 
                to mission requirements.
    (b) Treatment of Certain Arrangement.--
            (1) Discontinuation.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall 
        discontinue the evolved expendable launch vehicle launch 
        capability arrangement, as structured as of the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, by the later of--
                    (A) the date on which the Secretary determines that 
                the obligations of the contracts relating to such 
                arrangement, as of the date of the enactment of this 
                Act, have been met; or
                    (B) December 31, 2020.
            (2) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive paragraph (1) if the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) determines that such waiver is necessary for 
                the national security interests of the United States;
                    (B) notifies the congressional defense committees 
                of such waiver; and
                    (C) a period of 90 days has elapsed following the 
                date of such notification.
    (c) Consistent Standards.--In accordance with section 2306a of 
title 10, United States Code, the Secretary shall--
            (1) apply consistent and appropriate standards to certified 
        evolved expendable launch vehicle providers with respect to 
        certified cost and pricing data; and
            (2) conduct the appropriate audits.
    (d) Acquisition Strategy.--In accordance with subsections (b) and 
(c) and section 2273 of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary 
shall develop and carry out a ten-year phased acquisition strategy, 
including near and long term, for the evolved expendable launch vehicle 
program.
    (e) Elements.--The acquisition strategy under subsection (d) for 
the evolved expendable launch vehicle program shall establish a 
contracting plan for such program that uses competitive procedures (as 
defined in section 2302 of title 10, United States Code) and ensures 
that a contract awarded for launch services, capability, or 
infrastructure--
            (1) provides the necessary--
                    (A) stability in budgeting and acquisition of 
                capabilities; and
                    (B) flexibility to the Federal Government; and
            (2) specifically takes into account the effect of--
                    (A) all contracts entered into by the Federal 
                Government with, and any assistance provided by the 
                Federal Government to, certified evolved expendable 
                launch vehicle providers, including the evolved 
                expendable launch vehicle launch capability;
                    (B) the requirements of the Department of Defense, 
                including with respect to launch capabilities and 
                pricing data, that are met by such providers;
                    (C) the cost of integrating a satellite onto a 
                launch vehicle; and
                    (D) any other matters the Secretary considers 
                appropriate.
    (f) Competition.--In awarding any contract for launch services in a 
national security space mission pursuant to a competitive acquisition, 
the evaluation shall account for the value of the evolved expendable 
launch vehicle launch capability arrangement per contract line item 
numbers in the bid price of the offeror as appropriate per launch.
    (g) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of

              DETERRENCE MISSION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The safety, security, reliability, and credibility of 
        the nuclear deterrent of the United States is a vital national 
        security priority.
            (2) Nuclear weapons require special consideration because 
        of the political and military importance of the weapons, the 
        destructive power of the weapons, and the potential 
        consequences of an accident or unauthorized act involving the 
        weapons.
            (3) The assured safety, security, and control of nuclear 
        weapons and related systems are of paramount importance.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Navy has repeatedly demonstrated the commitment and 
        prioritization of the Navy to the nuclear deterrence mission of 
        the Navy;
            (2) the emphasis of the Navy on ensuring a safe, secure, 
        reliable, and credible sea-based nuclear deterrent force has 
        been matched by an equal emphasis on ensuring the assured 
        safety, security, and control of nuclear weapons and related 
        systems ashore; and
            (3) the Navy is commended for the actions the Navy has 
        taken subsequent to the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Review to

SEC. 1657. PROHIBITION ON DE-ALERTING INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
              MISSILES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that--
            (1) the responsiveness and alert levels of intercontinental 
        ballistic missiles are a unique feature of the ground-based leg 
        of the United States nuclear triad;

        providing robust nuclear deterrence and assurance; and
            (3) any action to reduce the responsiveness and alert 
        levels of United States intercontinental ballistic missiles 
        would be contrary to longstanding United States policy, and 
        deeply harmful to national security and strategic stability in 
        a crisis.
    (b) In General.--
            (1) Prohibition.--None of the funds authorized to be 
        appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal 
        year 2016 shall be obligated or expended for reducing, or 
        preparing to reduce, the responsiveness or alert level of 
        United States intercontinental ballistic missiles.
            (2) Clarification relating to maintenance, safety, 
        security, etc.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any of the 
        following activities:
                    (A) Maintenance or sustainment of intercontinental 
                ballistic missiles.

            (1) in paragraph (4), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a 
        semicolon;
            (2) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (7); and

        paragraphs:
            ``(5) the factors considered and processes used by the

                ``subsection (a)''.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in the past decade, competition of the management and 
        operating contracts for the national security laboratories has 
        resulted in significant increases in fees paid to the 
        contractors--funding that otherwise could be used to support 
        program and mission activities of the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration;
            (2) competition of the management and operating contracts 
        of the nuclear security enterprise is an important mechanism to 
        help realize cost savings, seek efficiencies, improve 
        performance, and hold contractors accountable;
            (3) when the Administrator for Nuclear Security considers 
        it appropriate to achieve these goals, the Administrator should 
        conduct competition of these contracts while recognizing the 
        unique nature of federally funded research and development 
        centers; and
            (4) the Administrator should ensure that fixed fees and 
        performance-based fees contained in management and operating 
        contracts are as low as possible to maintain a focus on 
        national service while attracting high-quality contractors and 
        achieving the goals of the competition.

SEC. 3115. NUCLEAR WEAPON DESIGN RESPONSIVENESS PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a modern and responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure 
        is only one component of a nuclear posture that is agile, 
        flexible, and responsive to change; and
            (2) to ensure the nuclear deterrent of the United States 
        remains safe, secure, reliable, credible, and responsive, the 
        United States must continually exercise all capabilities 
        required to conceptualize, study, design, develop, engineer, 
        certify, produce, and deploy nuclear weapons.

        all phases of the joint nuclear weapons life cycle process, 
        with respect to both the nuclear security enterprise and 
        relevant elements of the Department of Defense.
            ``(2) Identify, enhance, and transfer knowledge, skills, 
        and direct experience with respect to all phases of the joint 
        nuclear weapons life cycle process from one generation of

        testing.
            ``(5) Continually exercise processes for the integration 
        and coordination of all relevant elements and processes of the 
        Administration and the Department of Defense required to ensure 
        nuclear weapon design responsiveness.
    ``(d) Joint Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Process Defined.--In this 
section, the term `joint nuclear weapons life cycle process' means the 
process developed and maintained by the Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of Energy for the development, production, maintenance, and 
retirement of nuclear weapons.''.
