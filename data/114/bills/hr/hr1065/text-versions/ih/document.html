SEC. 2. IN GENERAL.

    (a) Training Requirement.--For each fiscal year after the 
expiration of the period specified in subsection (b) in which a State 
receives funds for a program referred to in subsection (c)(2), the 
State shall require that all individuals enrolled in an academy of a 
law enforcement agency of the State and all law enforcement officers of 
the State fulfill a training session on sensitivity each fiscal year, 
including training on ethnic and racial bias, cultural diversity, and 
police interaction with the disabled, mentally ill, and new immigrants. 
In the case of individuals attending an academy, such training session 
shall be for 8 hours, and in the case of all other law enforcement 
officers, the training session shall be for 4 hours.
    (b) Compliance and Ineligibility.--
            (1) Compliance date.--Each State shall have not more than 
        120 days, beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, to 
        comply with subsection (a), except that--
                    (A) the Attorney General may grant an additional 
                120 days to a State that is making good faith efforts 
                to comply with such subsection; and
                    (B) the Attorney General shall waive the 
                requirements of subsection (a) if compliance with such 
                subsection by a State would be unconstitutional under 
                the constitution of such State.
            (2) Ineligibility for funds.--For any fiscal year after the 
        expiration of the period specified in paragraph (1), a State 
        that fails to comply with subsection (a), shall, at the 
        discretion of the Attorney General, be subject to not more than 
        a 20-percent reduction of the funds that would otherwise be 
        allocated for that fiscal year to the State under subpart 1 of 
        part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
        Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), whether characterized as 
        the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement 
        Assistance Programs, the Local Government Law Enforcement Block 
        Grants Program, the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance 
        Grant Program, or otherwise.
    (c) Reallocation.--Amounts not allocated under a program referred 
to in subsection (b)(2) to a State for failure to fully comply with 
subsection (a) shall be reallocated under that program to States that 
have not failed to comply with such subsection.
