                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the health of 
    children and help better understand and enhance awareness about 
                 unexpected sudden death in early life.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Unexpected Deaths in 
Infants and Children Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Nearly 3,500 infants die suddenly and unexpectedly 
        every year.
            (2) Infants born to low-income women are more likely to die 
        before their first birthday than infants born in higher-income 
        households.
            (3) Non-Hispanic Black infants are more than twice as 
        likely to die of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death compared to 
        non-Hispanic White infants.
            (4) Disparities in sudden unexpected infant deaths account 
        for 14 percent of the infant mortality gap between non-Hispanic 
        Black infants compared to non-Hispanic White infants.
            (5) Preterm birth and low birth weight may be contributing 
        factors in deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, which is a 
        type of sudden unexpected infant death and the leading cause of 
        postneonatal deaths.
            (6) Timely prenatal care and appropriate birth spacing can 
        reduce the risks of early delivery and low birth weight.
            (7) Women can reduce the risk of infant mortality to their 
        infants by improving their own health, both preconception and 
        during pregnancy.
            (8) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends regular 
        prenatal care as a strategy for preventing SIDS, noting that 
        there is ``substantial epidemiologic evidence linking a lower 
        risk of SIDS for infants whose mothers obtain regular prenatal 
        care''.
