    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish 
a Smart Technology Traffic Signals Grant Program (in this section 
referred to as the ``Program'') to improve the functioning of traffic 
signals in a manner that--
            (1) reduces traffic congestion;
            (2) improves the safety and effectiveness of roadways;
            (3) reduces fuel costs for drivers; and
            (4) reduces air pollution.
    (b) Grant Authority.--In carrying out the Program, the Secretary 
may make grants, on a competitive basis, to a State, local, or tribal 
government entity.
    (c) Grant Uses.--An entity awarded a grant under the Program shall 
use the grant to improve traffic signals through the implementation of 
innovative technology, including--
            (1) adaptive signal control technology; and
            (2) real-time data measurement technology.
    (d) Timing.--A grant awarded to an entity under the Program shall 
be fully expended not later than the date that is 3 years after the 
date on which initial grant amounts are made available to the entity.
    (e) Federal Share.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        Federal share of the costs of a project assisted with a grant 
        under the Program may not exceed 80 percent.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary may waive paragraph (1) if a 
        State, local, or tribal government entity demonstrates, as 
        determined by the Secretary, extreme financial hardship.
            (3) In-kind contributions.--The non-Federal share of the 
        costs of a project assisted with a grant under the Program may 
        be derived in whole or in part from in-kind contributions.
    (f) Applications.--To be eligible for a grant under the Program a 
State, local, or tribal government entity shall submit to the Secretary 
an application at such time, in such form, and containing such 
information as the Secretary determines appropriate.
