are subject to liability under the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974.

SEC. 3. RULES RELATING TO THE PROVISION OF INVESTMENT ADVICE.

            (1) Definition of investment advice.--Section 3(21) of the 
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
        1002(21)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(C)(i) For purposes of clause (ii) of subparagraph (A), the term 
`investment advice' means a recommendation that--
            ``(I) relates to--
                    ``(aa) the advisability of acquiring, holding, 
                disposing, or exchanging any moneys or other property 
                of a plan by the plan, plan participants, or plan 
                beneficiaries, including any recommendation whether to 
                take a distribution of benefits from such plan or any 
                recommendation relating to the investment of any moneys 
                or other property of such plan to be rolled over or 
                otherwise distributed from such plan;
                    ``(bb) the management of moneys or other property 
                of such plan, including recommendations relating to the 
                management of moneys or other property to be rolled 
                over or otherwise distributed from such plan; or
                    ``(cc) the advisability of retaining or ceasing to 
                retain a person who would receive a fee or other 
                compensation for providing any of the types of advice 
                described in this subclause; and
            ``(II) is rendered pursuant to--
                    ``(aa) a written acknowledgment of the obligation 
                of the advisor to comply with section 404 with respect 
                to the provision of such recommendation; or
                    ``(bb) a mutual agreement, arrangement, or 
                understanding, which may include limitations on scope, 
                timing, and responsibility to provide ongoing 
                monitoring or advice services, between the person 
                making such recommendation and the plan that such 
                recommendation is individualized to the plan and such 
                plan intends to materially rely on such recommendation 
                in making investment or management decisions with 
                respect to any moneys or other property of such plan.
    ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(II)(bb), any disclaimer of a 
mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding shall only state the 
following: `This information is not individualized to you, and there is 
no intent for you to materially rely on this information in making 
investment or management decisions.'. Such disclaimer shall not be 
effective unless such disclaimer is in writing and is communicated in a 
clear and prominent manner and an objective person would reasonably 
conclude that, based on all the facts and circumstances, there was not 
a mutual agreement, arrangement, or understanding.
    ``(iii) For purposes of clause (i)(II)(bb), information shall not 
be considered to be a recommendation made pursuant to a mutual 
agreement, arrangement, or understanding, and such information shall 
contain the disclaimer required by clause (ii), if--
            ``(I) it is provided in conjunction with full and fair 
        disclosure in writing to a plan, plan participant, or 
        beneficiary that the person providing the information is doing 
        so in its marketing or sales capacity, including any 
        information regarding the terms and conditions of the 
        engagement of the person providing the information, and that

        the meaning of this subparagraph or to otherwise act within and 
        under the obligations of the best interest standard as 
        described in this subparagraph;

        arrangement, sale, purchase, loan, bilateral contract, swap (as 
        defined in section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 
        1a)), or security-based swap (as defined in section 3(a) of the 
        Securities Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)))), but only if--
                    ``(aa) the plan is represented, in connection with 
                such transaction, by a plan fiduciary who is 
                independent of the person providing the information,

                person has a financial interest in the transaction and 
                that it has determined that the person is not intending 
                to provide investment advice within the meaning of this 
                subparagraph or to otherwise act as a fiduciary to the 
                plan subject to section 404;
            ``(III) the person providing the information is an employee 
        of any sponsoring employer or employee organization who

                in whole or in part, of proprietary products), such 
                limitations, including a clearly-stated notice that the 
                same or similar investments may be available at a 
                different cost (greater or lesser) from other sources, 
                shall be clearly disclosed to the advice recipient

        1974 (including Department of Labor Interpretive Bulletin 96-1 
        (29 C.F.R. 2509.96-1) and Department of Labor Advisory Opinion

        promulgated by the Department of Labor prior to the date of the 
        enactment of this Act but not effective on January 1, 2015, may 
        become effective unless a bill or joint resolution referred to 
        in paragraph (3) is enacted as described in such paragraph not 
        later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) General effective date of amendments.--Except as 
        provided in paragraph (3), the amendments made by subsection 
        (a) of this section shall take effect on the 61st day after the
