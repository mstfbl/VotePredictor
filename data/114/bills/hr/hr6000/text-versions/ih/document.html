        ingredients suitable for human food consumption that are 
        generally recognized as safe for use in an alcoholic beverage,

        than 50 percent of the total Brix of the mead.
            (4) Allow, in the production mead, the density of the honey 
        and water mixture to be below 13 degrees Brix in the case of an
