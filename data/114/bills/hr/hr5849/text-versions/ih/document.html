SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``New Jobs Training Act''.

SEC. 2. GRANT PROGRAM.

    (a) Program Authorized.--From the amounts appropriated to carry out 
this Act, the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Education, shall award grants to employers to carry out the activities 
described in subsection (b).
    (b) Uses of Funds.--An employer that receives a grant under this 
section shall use such funds to partner with a community college to 
create a job training program for the purpose of training individuals 
for new jobs with the employer.
    (c) Application.--An employer that desires to receive a grant under 
this section shall submit an application to the Secretary of Labor at 
such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the 
Secretary may require, which shall include--
            (1) a description of the job training program that the 
        employer seeks to develop and carry out using the grant;
            (2) the community college with which the employer plans to 
        partner in developing and carrying out such job training 
        program; and
            (3) the number of new jobs the employer seeks to create as 
        a result of such job training program.
    (d) Definitions.--
            (1) Community college.--The term ``community college'' has 
        the meaning given the term ``junior or community college'' in 
        section 312 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
        1058).
            (2) New job.--The term ``new job'', when used with respect 
        to an employer, means a job that--
                    (A) may include a new position within an existing 
                job category, and is not a job of a recalled worker, a 
                replacement job, or any other job that existed in the 
                employer's business within the 1-year period preceding 
                the date of hire;
                    (B) is not a job that existed in a business 
                operation or substantially similar business operation 
                of the employer formerly located in another location 
                which was closed or substantially reduced by the 
                employer; and
                    (C) results in a net increase in employment for the 
                employer.
