SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On December 17, 2014, President Barack Obama announced 
        his plan to revise United States policy with respect to Cuba by 
        promising engagement and to ``normalize relations''.
            (2) The President, through the Department of the Treasury 
        and the Department of Commerce, has issued revisions to the 
        Cuban Assets Control Regulations and the Export Administration 
        Regulations relating to easing restrictions on travel to and 
        trade with Cuba.
            (3) Those revisions have been implemented pursuant to the 
        discretion of the President to modify licensing authorities 
        under the Cuban Assets Control Regulations and the Export 
        Administration Regulations.
            (4) The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) 
        Act of 1996 prohibits the full removal of the economic embargo 
        of Cuba and establishes requirements for discretionary 
        licensing authority including through the following provisions:
                    (A) Section 205(b)(2)(D) of that Act (22 U.S.C. 
                6065(b)(2)(D)), which requires the President to take 
                into account the extent to which the Government of Cuba 
                is ``taking appropriate steps to return to United 
                States citizens (and entities which are 50 percent or 
                more beneficially owned by United States citizens) 
                property taken by the Cuban Government from such 
                citizens and entities on or after January 1, 1959, or 
                to provide equitable compensation to such citizens and 
                entities for such property''.
                    (B) Section 206 of that Act (22 U.S.C. 6066), which 
                sets forth requirements for determining whether a 
                democratically elected government has been established 
                in Cuba and defines such a government as one that ``has 
                made demonstrable progress in returning to United 
                States citizens (and entities which are 50 percent or 
                more beneficially owned by United States citizens) 
                property taken by the Cuban Government from such 
                citizens and entities on or after January 1, 1959, or 
                providing full compensation for such property in 
                accordance with international law standards and 
                practice''.
                    (C) Section 103 of that Act of (22 U.S.C. 6033), 
                which prohibits a United States national or a United 
                States agency from knowingly providing financing for 
                transactions involving any property owned by a United 
                States national that was confiscated by the Government 
                of Cuba.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should not further pursue efforts to ease restrictions on travel 
to or trade with Cuba or to otherwise further normalize relations with 
Cuba until--
            (1) the President submits to Congress the plan described in 
        section 3(b);
            (2) all property taken by the Cuban Government from United 
        States nationals on or after January 1, 1959, has been returned 
        to such nationals or full compensation for such property has 
        been provided to such nationals; and
            (3) the Government of Cuba provides secure protection for 
        the internationally recognized human rights of the people of 
        Cuba.
