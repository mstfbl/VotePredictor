            ``(1) to a claim under this subchapter that has been 
        outstanding for more than 10 years; or

            (2) Section 14219 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act 
        of 2008 (Public Law 110-246; 122 Stat. 2245).

    The Commissioner of Social Security shall not use any funds to seek

seq.)--
            (1) from a child (as defined in section 216(e) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 416(e))) of the beneficiary, 
        when such child is without fault;
            (2) from an individual who had not attained the age of 18 
        years on the date such debt or claim arose; or
            (3) where such debt or claim has been outstanding for more 
        than 10 years.
