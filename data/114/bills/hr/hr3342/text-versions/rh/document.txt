  To provide for stability of title to certain lands in the State of 
                   Louisiana, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) On December 8, 1842, the Surveyor General of the United 
        States Government approved an original survey of lands in 
        Northern Louisiana, which included the lands surrounding Lake 
        Bistineau.
            (2) Under the Equal Footing Doctrine, the State of 
        Louisiana was entitled to the lands underlying the navigable 
        waters in place at statehood within its limits.
            (3) The State of Louisiana delineated its ownership based 
        on the United States Government's Original Survey of 1842.
            (4) In 1901, the State of Louisiana transferred over 7,000 
        acres of land to the Commissioners of the Bossier Levee 
        District through Louisiana Act Number 89 of 1892.
            (5) The State of Louisiana conducted a survey in 1901 that 
        followed the same path around Lake Bistineau as the Original 
        Survey of 1842.
            (6) The Bossier Levee District subsequently conveyed the 
        subject lands to private ownership in 1904. Lands within the 
        subject lands continued to be bought and sold in good faith 
        based on the stability of this title.
            (7) On September 16, 1967, the Bureau of Land Management 
        submitted a re-survey of the subject lands for S30-T16N-R10W 
        and two adjacent islands. The re-survey presented a new line to 
        represent what the Bureau of Land Management surveyors believed 
        was the contour of Lake Bistineau 155 years earlier, when 
        Louisiana joined the Union. The Bureau of Land Management 
        approved the re-survey on January 15, 1969. That re-survey was 
        filed in the Federal Register (34 Fed. Reg. 2677), but the 
        Bureau of Land Management has presented no records of further 
        notifying all of the affected landowners of the re-survey's 
        effects or that the re-survey could be contested.
            (8) On September 27, 2013, the Bureau of Land Management 
        responded to an inquiry by certain affected landowners to 
        inform them that title to their property would ``appear to be 
        still vested in the United States''.
            (9) There are estimated to be more than 200 acres and more 
        than 50 residential homes on the recently disputed lands.

SEC. 2. LEGAL STATUS OF RE-SURVEY.

    The document titled ``Dependent Re-Survey, Extension Survey and 
Survey of Two Islands, Sections 17, 29, and 30'' (completed on November 
24, 1967; approved on January 15, 1969; and filed in the Federal 
Register (34 Fed. Reg. 2677)) shall be void and have no legal force or 
effect. No future survey or re-survey of the lands that were the 
subject of that document undertaken by the Federal Government shall 
have any legal effect as to the title and boundaries of those subject 
lands.
