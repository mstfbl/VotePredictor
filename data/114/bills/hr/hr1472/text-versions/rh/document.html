        shall, except as provided in paragraph (4)--
                    (A) modernize the integrated public alert and

                referred to as the ``public alert and warning system'') 
                to ensure that the President under all conditions is 
                able to alert and warn governmental authorities and the 
                civilian population in areas endangered by disasters; 
                and

        subsection (b))--
                    (A) establish or adopt, as appropriate, common 
                alerting and warning protocols, standards, terminology, 
                and operating procedures for the public alert and

                risks, or personal user preferences, as appropriate;
                    (C) include in the public alert and warning system 
                the capability to alert, warn, and provide the

                disabilities and individuals with access and functional 
                needs;
                    (D) ensure that training, tests, and exercises are 
                conducted for the public alert and warning system and

                Alert System; and
                    (F) ensure that the public alert and warning system 
                is resilient, secure, and can withstand acts of 
                terrorism and other external attacks.
            (3) System requirements.--Consistent with paragraph (1),

                tourists and individuals with disabilities and access 
                and functional needs, and improve the ability of remote

                particular device; and
                    (F) include a mechanism to ensure the protection of
