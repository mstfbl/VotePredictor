                        recommendations.
            ``(4) Economic analysis.--The Commission's conclusions 
        contained in the report described in paragraph (3) shall be 
        supported by economic analysis.
            ``(5) Requirements for promulgating a rule.--The Commission 
        shall publish in the Federal Register alongside the rule 
        promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) formal findings that such 
        rule would reduce confusion or harm to retail customers (and 
        such other customers as the Commission may by rule provide) due 
        to different standards of conduct applicable to brokers, 
        dealers, and investment advisors.
            ``(6) Requirements under investment advisers act of 1940.--
        In proposing rules under paragraph (1) for brokers or dealers, 
        the Commission shall consider the differences in the
