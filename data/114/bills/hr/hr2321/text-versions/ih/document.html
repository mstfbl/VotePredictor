                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide 
           grants for innovative teacher retention programs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Teachers Teaching Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States faces an increasing need for high-
        quality educators. The Department of Education estimates the 
        United States will need about 430,000 new elementary and 
        secondary teachers by 2020.
            (2) For the first time since the 1960s, teachers with 10 
        years of experience or less now constitute more than half of 
        our teaching force.
            (3) Research shows that a key reason for teacher turnover 
        is job dissatisfaction, which may result from poor working 
        conditions, inadequate administrative support, low salary, low 
        morale, or lack of a pathway for professional advancement.
            (4) The National Center for Education Statistics found a 
        correlation between the level of support and training provided 
        to new teachers and the likelihood of a teacher leaving after 
        their first year, with teachers who are assigned a mentor 
        teacher more likely to continue their teaching careers than 
        those who did not.
            (5) Efforts to address the teacher shortage demands a 
        national strategy to support the development and implementation 
        of innovative teacher retention programs.
            (6) Effective teacher retention programs to address this 
        problem are already at work in local educational agencies 
        around the country, and many more innovative programs could be 
        advanced if additional resources were available.
            (7) The Department of Education has made teacher 
        recruitment and retention a priority, and can play an important 
        role in facilitating the identification of the most promising 
        teacher retention approaches and disseminating information 
        about them to State educational agencies and local educational 
        agencies.

SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR INNOVATIVE TEACHER RETENTION PROGRAMS.
