other factors.
    ``(B) The Secretary may renew a contract with an administrative 
contractor under this section from term to term without regard to

the application of competitive procedures under such a contract not 
less frequently than once every 5 years.
    ``(C) The Secretary may transfer functions among administrative

information for the contractors involved).
    ``(D) The Secretary shall provide incentives for administrative

provided, and other matters as the Secretary finds pertinent.
    ``(3)(A)(i) The Secretary shall develop contract performance 
requirements to carry out the specific requirements applicable under 
this title to a function described in subsection (a)(4) and shall 
develop standards for measuring the extent to which a contractor has

performance duties expected of a medical director of an administrative 
contractor, including requirements relating to professional relations 
and the availability of such director to conduct medical determination 
activities within the jurisdiction of such a contractor.

this section with respect to such performance requirements.

the contract between the Secretary and the appropriate administrative 
contractor. Such performance requirements--
            ``(i) shall reflect the performance requirements published 
        under subparagraph (A), but may include additional performance 
        requirements;
            ``(ii) shall be used for evaluating contractor performance 
        under the contract; and
            ``(iii) shall be consistent with the written statement of 
        work provided under the contract.
    ``(4) The Secretary shall not enter into a contract with an 
administrative contractor under this section unless the contractor

            ``(A) to furnish to the Secretary such timely information 
        and reports as the Secretary may find necessary in performing 
        the functions of the Secretary under this title; and
            ``(B) to maintain such records and afford such access 
        thereto as the Secretary finds necessary to assure the 
        correctness and verification of the information and reports 
        under subparagraph (A) and otherwise to carry out the purposes 
        of this title.
    ``(5) A contract with an administrative contractor under this 
section may require the administrative contractor, and any of its 
officers or employees certifying payments or disbursing funds pursuant 
to the contract, or otherwise participating in carrying out the 
contract, to give surety bond to the United States in such amount as 
the Secretary may deem appropriate.
    ``(c) Terms and Conditions.--A contract with any administrative 
contractor under this section may contain such terms and conditions as 
the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate and may provide for 
advances of funds to the administrative contractor for the making of 
payments by it under subsection (a)(4)(B).
    ``(d) Limitation on Liability of Administrative Contractors and 
Certain Officers.--(1) No individual designated pursuant to a contract 
under this section as a certifying officer shall, in the absence of the 
reckless disregard of the individual's obligations or the intent by 
that individual to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to 
any payments certified by the individual under this section.
    ``(2) No disbursing officer shall, in the absence of the reckless 
disregard of the officer's obligations or the intent by that officer to 
defraud the United States, be liable with respect to any payment by 
such officer under this section if it was based upon an authorization 
(which meets the applicable requirements for such internal controls 
established by the Comptroller General of the United States) of a 
certifying officer designated as provided in paragraph (1) of this 
subsection.
    ``(3)(A) No administrative contractor shall be liable to the United 
States for a payment by a certifying or disbursing officer unless, in 
connection with such payment, the administrative contractor acted with 
reckless disregard of its obligations under its administrative contract 
or with intent to defraud the United States.
    ``(B) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit 
liability for conduct that would constitute a violation of sections 
3729 through 3731 of title 31, United States Code.
    ``(4)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (D), in the case of an 
administrative contractor (or a person who is a director, officer, or 
employee of such a contractor or who is engaged by the contractor to 
participate directly in the claims administration process) who is made 
a party to any judicial or administrative proceeding arising from or 
relating directly to the claims administration process under this 
title, the Secretary may, to the extent the Secretary determines to be 
appropriate and as specified in the contract with the contractor, 
indemnify the contractor and such persons.
    ``(B) The Secretary may not provide indemnification under 
subparagraph (A) insofar as the liability for such costs arises 
directly from conduct that is determined by the judicial proceeding or 
by the Secretary to be criminal in nature, fraudulent, or grossly 
negligent. If indemnification is provided by the Secretary with respect 
to a contractor before a determination that such costs arose directly 
from such conduct, the contractor shall reimburse the Secretary for 
costs of indemnification.
    ``(C) Indemnification by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) may 
include payment of judgments, settlements (subject to subparagraph 
(D)), awards, and costs (including reasonable legal expenses).
    ``(D) A contractor or other person described in subparagraph (A) 
may not propose to negotiate a settlement or compromise of a proceeding 
described in such subparagraph without the prior written approval of 
the Secretary to negotiate such settlement or compromise. Any 
indemnification under subparagraph (A) with respect to amounts paid 
under a settlement or compromise of a proceeding described in such 
subparagraph are conditioned upon prior written approval by the 
Secretary of the final settlement or compromise.
    ``(E) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed--
            ``(i) to change any common law immunity that may be 
        available to an administrative contractor or person described 
        in subparagraph (A); or
            ``(ii) to permit the payment of costs not otherwise 
        allowable, reasonable, or allocable under the Federal 
        Acquisition Regulation.
    ``(e) Requirements for Information Security.--(1) An administrative 
contractor that performs the functions referred to in subparagraphs (A) 
and (B) of subsection (a)(4) (relating to determining and making 
payments) shall implement a contractor-wide information security 
program to provide information security for the operation and assets of 
the contractor with respect to such functions under this title. An 
information security program under this paragraph shall meet the 
requirements for information security programs imposed on Federal 
agencies under paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 3544(b) of title 
44, United States Code (other than the requirements under paragraphs 
(2)(D)(i), (5)(A), and (5)(B) of such section).
    ``(2)(A) Each year an administrative contractor that performs the 
functions referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(4) 
(relating to determining and making payments) shall undergo an 
evaluation of the information security of the contractor with respect 
to such functions under this title. The evaluation shall--
            ``(i) be performed by an entity that meets such 
        requirements for independence as the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Health and Human Services may establish; and
            ``(ii) test the effectiveness of information security 
        control techniques of an appropriate subset of the contractor's 
        information systems (as defined in section 3502(8) of title 44, 
        United States Code) relating to such functions under this title 
        and an assessment of compliance with the requirements of this 
        subsection and related information security policies, 
        procedures, standards and guidelines, including policies and 
        procedures as may be prescribed by the Director of the Office 
        of Management and Budget and applicable information security 
        standards promulgated under section 11331 of title 40, United 
        States Code.
    ``(B)(i) The results of independent evaluations under subparagraph 
(A) shall be submitted promptly to the Inspector General of the 
Department and to the Secretary.
    ``(ii) The Inspector General of the Department shall submit to 
Congress annual reports on the results of such evaluations, including 
assessments of the scope and sufficiency of such evaluations.
    ``(f) Incentives To Improve Contractor Performance in Non-
Department Facility Education and Outreach.--The Secretary shall use 
specific claims payment error rates or similar methodology of 
administrative contractors in the processing or reviewing of claims in 
order to give such contractors an incentive to implement effective 
education and outreach programs for non-Department facilities.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
such chapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 
1725 the following new item:

``1725. Authority to enter into contracts with administrative 
                            contractors.''.
