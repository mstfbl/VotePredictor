enactment of this Act, a cleaning product manufactured for sale, 
offered for sale, distributed in commerce, or imported to the United 
States after such date shall bear a label on the product's container or 
packaging with, and the manufacturer of the product shall include on 
the website of the manufacturer (if the manufacturer maintains a 
website), a complete and accurate list of all the product's 
ingredients, including the individual ingredients in dyes, fragrances, 
and preservatives. Ingredients shall be listed in accordance with the 
following:
            (1) Ingredients shall be listed in descending order of 
        predominance in the product by weight, other than ingredients 
        that constitute less than 1 percent of the product, which may 
        be listed at the end in any order.
            (2) The list of ingredients on the website of the product 
        shall--
                    (A) include the CAS Registry Number of each 
                ingredient;
                    (B) include an explanation of each ingredient's 
                purpose for being in the cleaning product; and
                    (C) be available in English, Spanish, and any other 
                language the Commission determines necessary to ensure 
                that users of the product in the United States are 
                informed as to the complete list of the product's 
                ingredients and their function.
    (b) Treatment Under the FHSA.--A cleaning product that is not in 
conformity with the labeling requirements of subsection (a), including 
a product the manufacturer of which is not in compliance with the 
website listing requirement with respect to such product, shall be 
treated as a substance defined in section 2(p) of the Federal Hazardous 
Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(p)) for purposes of such Act.
    (c) No Effect on Existing Labeling Requirements.--Nothing in this 
Act shall be interpreted as having any effect on any labeling 
requirements in effect before the date of enactment of this Act as 
described in section 2(p) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 
U.S.C. 1261(p)) or the Hazard Communication Standard of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
    (d) Rulemaking Authority.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, in consultation with the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency as necessary, the Commission shall 
issue regulations--
            (1) to ensure a standardized method of listing ingredients 
        in an accessible, uniform, and legible manner on both the label 
        and website of a product as required by subsection (a); and
            (2) to provide for the effective enforcement of this Act.

SEC. 3. PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW PETITION.

    (a) Petition.--Any person may submit a petition to the Commission 
alleging that a cleaning product available in interstate commerce does 
not satisfy the labeling requirements of this Act, including a product 
the manufacturer of which is not in compliance with the requirement to 
list the product's ingredients on its website.
    (b) Action by the Commission.--The Commission shall notify a 
petitioner of the receipt of a petition within 30 days after receipt of 
such petition. The Commission shall investigate the claims made by the 
petition and make a determination as to the validity of such claims 
within 180 days after acknowledging the receipt of such petition. If 
the Commission sustains the claim or claims made by the petition, the 
Commission shall initiate the proper enforcement actions required by 
law.
    (c) Regulations.--The Commission may issue such regulations as it 
determines necessary to require that petitions include a reasonable 
evidentiary basis for the claims made therein.

SEC. 4. PREEMPTION.

    Nothing in this Act affects the right of a State or political 
subdivision of a State to adopt or enforce any regulation, requirement, 
or standard of performance that is different from, or in addition to, a 
regulation, requirement, liability, or standard of performance 
established pursuant to this Act unless compliance with both this Act 
and the State or political subdivision of a State regulation, 
requirement, or standard of performance is impossible, in which case 
the applicable provision of this Act shall control.
