    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            ``(1) Lake Tahoe--
                    ``(A) is one of the largest, deepest, and clearest 
                lakes in the world;
                    ``(B) has a cobalt blue color, a biologically 
                diverse alpine setting, and remarkable water clarity; 
                and
                    ``(C) is recognized nationally and worldwide as a 
                natural resource of special significance;
            ``(2) in addition to being a scenic and ecological 
        treasure, the Lake Tahoe Basin is one of the outstanding 
        recreational resources of the United States, which--
                    ``(A) offers skiing, water sports, biking, camping, 
                and hiking to millions of visitors each year; and
                    ``(B) contributes significantly to the economies of 
                California, Nevada, and the United States;
            ``(3) the economy in the Lake Tahoe Basin is dependent on 
        the conservation and restoration of the natural beauty and 
        recreation opportunities in the area;
            ``(4) the ecological health of the Lake Tahoe Basin 
        continues to be challenged by the impacts of land use and 
        transportation patterns developed in the last century;
            ``(5) the alteration of wetland, wet meadows, and stream 
        zone habitat have compromised the capacity of the watershed to 
        filter sediment, nutrients, and pollutants before reaching Lake 
        Tahoe;
            ``(6) forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin suffer from over a 
        century of fire damage and periodic drought, which have 
        resulted in--
                    ``(A) high tree density and mortality;
                    ``(B) the loss of biological diversity; and
                    ``(C) a large quantity of combustible forest fuels, 
                which significantly increases the threat of 
                catastrophic fire and insect infestation;
            ``(7) the establishment of several aquatic and terrestrial 
        invasive species (including perennial pepperweed, milfoil, and 
        Asian clam) threatens the ecosystem of the Lake Tahoe Basin;
            ``(8) there is an ongoing threat to the economy and 
        ecosystem of the Lake Tahoe Basin of the introduction and 
        establishment of other invasive species (such as yellow 
        starthistle, New Zealand mud snail, Zebra mussel, and quagga 
        mussel);
            ``(9) 78 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe Basin is 
        administered by the Federal Government, which makes it a 
        Federal responsibility to restore ecological health to the Lake 
        Tahoe Basin;
            ``(10) the Federal Government has a long history of 
        environmental stewardship at Lake Tahoe, including--

                the Planning Agency with--
