1720(c)(1) of this title or a contract with each State home for payment 
by the Secretary for adult day health care provided to a veteran who is 
eligible for, but does not receive, nursing home care pursuant to 
subsection (a).
    ``(2) Payment under each agreement or contract between the 
Secretary and a State home under paragraph (1) for each veteran who 
receives care under such paragraph shall be made at a rate that is 
equal to 65 percent of the payment that the Secretary would pay to the 
State home pursuant to subsection (a)(2) if the veteran received 
nursing home care under subsection (a) rather than under paragraph (1) 
of this subsection.
    ``(3) Payment by the Secretary under paragraph (1) to a State home 
for adult day health care provided to a veteran described in that 
paragraph constitutes payment in full to the State home for such care 
furnished to that veteran.''; and
            (2) in the heading, by inserting ``, adult day health 
        care,'' after ``home care''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 17 of such title is amended by striking the item relating to 
section 1745 and inserting the following new item:

``1745. Nursing home care, adult day health care, and medications for
