                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Education to award grants for teacher-led 
projects to improve academic growth in elementary school and secondary 
                    school, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Teach to Lead Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Teachers, because of their position in the classroom, 
        often see important opportunities to improve student learning 
        most directly and thus have a unique perspective from which to 
        create practical solutions to help students succeed.
            (2) According to a Scholastic and Bill & Melinda Gates 
        Foundation poll, 69 percent of teachers feel that their voices 
        are heard in their school, but only one-third feel heard in 
        their district, five percent in their State, and two percent at 
        the national level.
            (3) The failure to leverage teachers' expertise has a 
        negative impact on teacher engagement in education reforms and 
        misses a critical opportunity for administrators and 
        policymakers to draw on knowledge and expertise from the 
        classroom that can help address critical education needs and 
        challenges.
            (4) Empowering teachers to lead beyond the classroom, 
        without necessarily leaving the classroom, will demonstrate the 
        trust and respect for teachers, as professionals, that they 
        deserve and will help improve teaching and student outcomes.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to empower teachers to develop and 
implement projects with the potential to have a wider impact on 
developing the knowledge, pedagogical skills, and conditions needed to 
improve teaching and student outcomes, particularly academic growth, by 
bringing their classroom knowledge and expertise directly to bear on 
the many challenges confronting our education system.

SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.
