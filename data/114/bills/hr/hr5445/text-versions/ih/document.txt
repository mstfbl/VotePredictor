            ``(5) Special rule for married individuals with family

                    ``(A) In general.--In the case of individuals who 
                are married to each other, if both spouses are eligible 
                individuals and either spouse has family coverage under 
                a high deductible health plan as of the first day of 
                any month--
                            ``(i) the limitation under paragraph (1) 
                        shall be applied by not taking into account any 
                        other high deductible health plan coverage of 
                        either spouse (and if such spouses both have 
                        family coverage under separate high deductible 
                        health plans, only one such coverage shall be 
                        taken into account),
                            ``(ii) such limitation (after application 
                        of clause (i)) shall be reduced by the 
                        aggregate amount paid to Archer MSAs of such 
                        spouses for the taxable year, and
                            ``(iii) such limitation (after application 
                        of clauses (i) and (ii)) shall be divided 
                        equally between such spouses unless they agree 
                        on a different division.
                    ``(B) Treatment of additional contribution 
                amounts.--If both spouses referred to in subparagraph 
                (A) have attained age 55 before the close of the 
                taxable year, the limitation referred to in 
                subparagraph (A)(iii) which is subject to division 
                between the spouses shall include the additional 
                contribution amounts determined under paragraph (3) for 
                both spouses. In any other case, any additional 
                contribution amount determined under paragraph (3) 
                shall not be taken into account under subparagraph 
                (A)(iii) and shall not be subject to division between 
                the spouses.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply

                    ``(D) Treatment of certain medical expenses 
                incurred before establishment of account.--If a health 
                savings account is established during the 60-day period 
                beginning on the date that coverage of the account 
                beneficiary under a high deductible health plan begins, 
                then, solely for purposes of determining whether an 
                amount paid is used for a qualified medical expense, 
                such account shall be treated as having been 
                established on the date that such coverage begins.''.

with respect to coverage beginning after December 31, 2016.
