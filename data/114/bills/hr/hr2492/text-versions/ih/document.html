            (2) Freshwater flows.--The term ``freshwater flows'' means 
        the quality, quantity, timing, and variability of freshwater

                    (A) to support and reestablish--
                            (i) the physical, chemical, biological, and 
                        overall ecological integrity of the components, 
                        functions, and natural processes required for a 
                        thriving and resilient Chattahoochee River,

                        and plant populations having species 
                        composition, diversity, adaptability, and 
                        functional organization similar to those found 
                        in the Chattahoochee River and Apalachicola 
                        River ecosystems prior to construction of the 
                        Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects;
                    (B) to restore and recover species that are 
                endangered, threatened, or at risk; and
