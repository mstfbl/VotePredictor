    (a) In General.--In order to advance the security, trade 
enforcement, and trade facilitation missions of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, the Commissioner shall ensure that partnership programs of 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection established before the date of the 
enactment of this Act, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against 
Terrorism established under subtitle B of title II of the Security and 
Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 961 et seq.), and 
partnership programs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection established

under subsection (a), the Commissioner shall--
            (1) consult with private sector entities, the public, and

        programs of U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
            (3) consider consolidating partnership programs in 
        situations in which doing so would support the objectives of

        the trade benefits provided to participants in such programs, 
        and enhance the allocation of the resources of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection;
            (4) coordinate with the Director of U.S. Immigration and

                those agencies to clear or license the merchandise for 
                entry into the United States; and
                    (D) to create pathways, within and among the 
                appropriate Federal agencies, for qualified persons 
                that demonstrate the highest levels of compliance to 
                receive immediate clearance absent information that a 
                transaction may pose a national security or compliance 
                threat; and
            (5) ensure that trade benefits are provided to participants

                        or individual countervailing duty rate 
                        determined for an exporter or producer in a 
                        review conducted under clause (i) shall be

                                such sales;
                                    ``(V) whether the subject 
                                merchandise involved in such sales were

                                on an arms-length basis; and
                                    ``(VII) any other factor the

                                are, or are not, likely to be typical 
                                of those the exporter or producer will 
                                make after completion of the review.''.
