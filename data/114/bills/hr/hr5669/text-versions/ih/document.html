                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Creating Opportunities for America's 
Laid-off (COAL) Miners Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FEDERAL-STATE AGREEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Any qualifying State which desires to do so may 
enter into and participate in an agreement under this Act with the 
Secretary of Labor (in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary''). Any 
State which is a party to an agreement under this Act may, upon 
providing 30 days' written notice to the Secretary, terminate such 
agreement.
    (b) Qualifying State.--For purposes of subsection (a), a 
``qualifying State'' means a State in which the coal mining and related 
industries have been adversely impacted by regulations promulgated by 
the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of the Interior, 
including--
            (1) Alabama;
            (2) Illinois;
            (3) Indiana;
            (4) Kentucky;
            (5) Ohio;
            (6) Pennsylvania;
            (7) Tennessee;

            (9) West Virginia;
            (10) Wyoming; and
            (11) any other State that the Secretary determines--
                    (A) has traditionally relied on coal mining for a 
                substantial portion of its economy; and
                    (B) has experienced a significant reduction in coal 
                mining-related activity over the 5-year period 
                preceding the determination, as demonstrated by 
                employment data, per capita income, or other indicators 
                of reduced economic activity.
    (c) Provisions of Agreement.--Any agreement under subsection (a) 
shall provide that the State agency of the State will make payments of 
coal mining emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who--
            (1) have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under 
        the State law or under Federal law with respect to a benefit 
        year (excluding any benefit year that ended before the date of 
        the enactment of this Act);
            (2) have no rights to regular compensation with respect to 
        a week under such law or any other State unemployment 
        compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal 
        law;
            (3) are not receiving compensation with respect to such 
        week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada; and
            (4) are able to work, available to work, and actively 
        seeking work.
    (d) Exhaustion of Benefits.--For purposes of subsection (c)(1), an 
individual shall be deemed to have exhausted such individual's rights 
to regular compensation under a State law when--
            (1) no payments of regular compensation can be made under 
        such law because such individual has received all regular 
        compensation available to such individual based on employment 
        or wages during such individual's base period; or
            (2) such individual's rights to such compensation have been 
        terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with 
        respect to which such rights existed.
    (e) Weekly Benefit Amount, etc.--For purposes of any agreement 
under subsection (a)--
            (1) the amount of coal mining emergency unemployment 
        compensation which shall be payable to any individual for any 
        week of total unemployment shall be equal to the amount of the 
        regular compensation (including dependents' allowances) payable 
        to such individual during such individual's benefit year under 
        the State law for a week of total unemployment;
            (2) the terms and conditions of the State law which apply 
        to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof 
        (including terms and conditions relating to availability for 
        work, active search for work, and refusal to accept work) shall 
        apply to claims for coal mining emergency unemployment 
        compensation and the payment thereof, except--
                    (A) that an individual shall not be eligible for 
                coal mining emergency unemployment compensation under 
                this Act unless, in the base period with respect to 
                which the individual exhausted all rights to regular 
                compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 
                weeks of full-time insured employment or the equivalent 
                in insured wages, as determined under the provisions of 
                the State law implementing section 202(a)(5) of the 
                Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 
                1970 (26 U.S.C. 3304 note); and
                    (B) where otherwise inconsistent with the 
                provisions of this Act or with the regulations or 
                operating instructions of the Secretary promulgated to 
                carry out this Act; and
            (3) the maximum amount of coal mining emergency 
        unemployment compensation payable to any individual for whom a 
        coal mining emergency unemployment compensation account is 
        established under section 3 shall not exceed the amount 
        established in such account for such individual.
    (f) Coordination Rule.--An agreement under subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to a State only upon a determination by the 
Secretary that, under the State law or other applicable rules of such 
State, the payment of extended compensation for which an individual is 
otherwise eligible must be deferred until after the payment of any coal 
mining emergency unemployment compensation under section 3 for which 
the individual is concurrently eligible.
    (g) Unauthorized Aliens Ineligible.--A State shall require as a 
condition of eligibility for coal mining emergency unemployment 
compensation under this Act that each alien who receives such 
compensation must be legally authorized to work in the United States, 
as defined for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (26 U.S.C. 
3301 et seq.). In determining whether an alien meets the requirements 
of this subsection, a State must follow the procedures provided in 
section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)).
    (h) Actively Seeking Work.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (c)(4), the

        individual, that such individual--
                    (A) is registered for employment services in such a 
                manner and to such extent as prescribed by the State 
                agency;
                    (B) has engaged in an active search for employment 
                that is appropriate in light of the employment 
                available in the labor market, the individual's skills 
                and capabilities, and includes a number of employer 
                contacts that is consistent with the standards 
                communicated to the individual by the State;
                    (C) has maintained a record of such work search, 
                including employers contacted, method of contact, and 
                date contacted; and
                    (D) when requested, has provided such work search 
                record to the State agency.
            (2) Random auditing.--The Secretary shall establish for 
        each participating State a minimum number of claims for which 
        work search records must be audited on a random basis in any 
        given week.

                individual who receives coal mining emergency 
                unemployment compensation under this Act, while such 
                individual continues to receive such compensation.
                    (B) As a condition of eligibility for coal mining 
                emergency unemployment compensation for any week--
                            (i) a claimant who has been duly referred 
                        to reemployment services shall participate in 
                        such services; and
                            (ii) a claimant shall be actively seeking

                to the individual during the individual's benefit year 
                under such law, or

                entitled to coal mining emergency unemployment 
                compensation with respect to a benefit year,
                    (B) that benefit year has expired,
                    (C) that individual has remaining entitlement to 
                coal mining emergency unemployment compensation with

                    (D) that individual would qualify for a new benefit 
                year in which the weekly benefit amount of regular 
                compensation is at least either $100 or 25 percent less 
                than the individual's weekly benefit amount in the

                benefit year referred to in paragraph (1)(A).
                    (B) The State shall, if permitted by State law, 
                defer the establishment of a new benefit year (which 
                uses all the wages and employment which would have been 
                used to establish a benefit year but for the 
                application of this paragraph), until exhaustion of all 
                coal mining emergency unemployment compensation payable 
                with respect to the benefit year referred to in 
                paragraph (1)(A).
                    (C) The State shall pay, if permitted by State 
                law--

                        weekly benefit amount established under the new 
                        benefit year, and
                            (ii) coal mining emergency unemployment 
                        compensation equal to the difference between 
                        that weekly benefit amount and the weekly 
                        benefit amount for the expired benefit year.
                    (D) The State shall determine rights to coal mining 
                emergency unemployment compensation without regard to 
                any rights to regular compensation if the individual

                under the new benefit year.

will be entitled to receive under this Act for each calendar month, 
reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any amount by which the

        or allowance with respect to any week of unemployment, during 
        the 3-year period after the date such individuals received the 
        payment of the coal mining emergency unemployment compensation
