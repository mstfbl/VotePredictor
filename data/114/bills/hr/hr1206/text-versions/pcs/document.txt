            (2) Seriously delinquent tax debt.--For purposes of this 
        section, the term ``seriously delinquent tax debt'' means an 
        outstanding debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for 
        which a notice of lien has been filed in public records

                7122 of such Code;

                respect to which the individual agrees to be subject to 
                a levy made under such section); and

        (b) cannot be made;
            (2) provides an explanation of why such certification is 
        not possible;
            (3) outlines the remedial actions that would be required 
        for the Secretary to be in a position to so certify; and
