              TITLE I--RECOGNITION OF TRUST RESPONSIBILITY

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) there exists a unique relationship between the 
        Government of the United States and the governments of Indian 
        tribes;
            (2) there exists a unique Federal responsibility to 
        Indians;
            (3) through treaties, statutes, and historical relations 
        with Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a unique 
        trust responsibility to protect and support Indian tribes and 
        Indians;
            (4) the fiduciary responsibilities of the United States to 
        Indians also are founded in part on specific commitments made 
        through written treaties and agreements securing peace, in 
        exchange for which Indians have surrendered claims to vast 
        tracts of land, which provided legal consideration for 
        permanent, ongoing performance of Federal trust duties; and
            (5) the foregoing historic Federal-tribal relations and 
        understandings have benefitted the people of the United States 
        as a whole for centuries and have established enduring and 
        enforceable Federal obligations to which the national honor has 
        been committed.

SEC. 102. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.

    Pursuant to the constitutionally vested authority of Congress over 
Indian affairs, Congress reaffirms that the responsibility of the 
United States to Indian tribes includes a duty to promote tribal self-
determination regarding governmental authority and economic 
development.

        the Secretary to fulfill the trust obligation of the United

                rescission of the approval of the regulation involved, 
                or the reassumption of the trust asset transaction 
                approval responsibilities, provide to the applicable

participating in the project for any loss resulting from the management 
of an Indian trust asset under an Indian trust asset management plan.
    (b) Deviation From Standard Practices.--The United States shall not 
be liable to any party (including any Indian tribe) for any term of, or

standard than the Secretary would otherwise require or adhere to in 
absence of an Indian trust asset management plan.
    (c) Effect of Termination of Plan.--Subsection (b) applies to 
losses resulting from a transaction or activity described in that

        the management or administration of Indian trust assets.
            (2) Indian self-determination act.--Nothing in this title 
        limits or otherwise affects the authority of an Indian tribe, 
        including an Indian tribe participating in the project, to

        agreement under the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.) (including regulations).
    (e) Separate Approval.--An Indian tribe may submit to the Secretary

management plan.

diminishes, or otherwise affects the trust responsibility of the United
