            ``(3) Extended application period.--Notwithstanding 
        paragraph (1), and subject to the availability of amounts made 
        available to the compensation fund before the date of the 
        enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary may make a payment 
        from the compensation fund to an eligible person who, during 
        the one-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of 
        this paragraph, submits to the Secretary--
                    ``(A) a claim for benefits under this section; or
                    ``(B) with respect to a person who filed a claim 
                for benefits under this section during the period 
                described in paragraph (1), a new claim or an appeal to 
                such previously filed claim.''.
    (b) Proof.--Such section 1002 is further amended by adding at the 
end the following new subsection:
    ``(m) Use of AGO Form 23.--
            ``(1) In general.--In addition to any other documents that 
        the Secretary accepts as proof of service described in 
        subsection (d), the Secretary shall accept as proof of such 
        service an affidavit from the government of the Philippines 
        certifying such service of an eligible individual (AGO Form 
        23). Such an affidavit shall serve as proof of such service 
        regardless of whether the eligible individual--
                    ``(A) submits any other document accepted by the 
                Secretary to establish such proof; or
                    ``(B) is included in the Approved Revised 
                Reconstructed Guerilla Roster of 1948, known as the 
                `Missouri List'.
            ``(2) Proof of service only for this section.--The 
        Secretary may not accept an affidavit described in paragraph 
        (1) as proof of service for any benefit provided under a law 
        administered by the Secretary other than the compensation fund 
        under this section.''.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section or the amendments made 
by this section shall be construed as authorizing additional amounts to 
be appropriated to the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund 
established by such section 1002.
