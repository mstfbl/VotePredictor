  To authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out certain 
major medical facility projects for which appropriations are being made 
                         for fiscal year 2016.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fiscal Year 2016 Department of 
Veterans Affairs Seismic Safety and Construction Authorization Act''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS OF THE 
              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 
        114-113), which was signed by the President on December 18, 
        2015, included the following amounts to be appropriated to the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs:
                    (A) $35,000,000 to make seismic corrections to 
                Building 208 at the West Los Angeles Medical Center of 
                the Department in Los Angeles, California, which, 
                according to the Department, is a building that is 
                designated as having an exceptionally high risk of 
                sustaining substantial damage or collapsing during an 
                earthquake.
                    (B) $158,000,000 to provide for the construction of 
                a new research building, site work, and demolition at 
                the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
                    (C) $161,000,000 to replace Building 133 with a new 
                community living center at the Long Beach Veterans 
                Affairs Medical Center, which, according to the 
                Department, is a building that is designated as having 
                an extremely high risk of sustaining major damage 
                during an earthquake.
                    (D) $468,800,000 for construction projects that are 
                critical to the Department for ensuring health care 
                access and safety at medical facilities in Louisville, 
                Kentucky, Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, Missouri, 
                Perry Point, Maryland, American Lake, Washington, 
                Alameda, California, and Livermore, California.
            (2) The Department is unable to obligate or expend the 
        amounts described in paragraph (1), other than for construction 
        design, because the Department lacks an explicit authorization 
        by an Act of Congress pursuant to section 8104(a)(2) of title 
        38, United States Code, to carry out the major medical facility 
        projects described in such paragraph.
            (3) Among the major medical facility projects described in 
        paragraph (1), three are critical seismic safety projects in 
        California.
            (4) Every day that the critical seismic safety projects 
        described in paragraph (3) are delayed increases the risk of a 
        life-threatening building failure in the case of a major 
        seismic event.
            (5) According to the United States Geological Survey--
                    (A) California has more than a 99-percent chance of 
                experiencing an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater 
                in the next 30 years;
                    (B) even earthquakes of less severity than 
                magnitude 6.7 can cause life threatening damage to 
                seismically unsafe buildings; and
                    (C) in California, earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or 
                greater occur on average once every 1.2 years.
    (b) Authorization.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may carry out 
the following major medical facility projects, with each project to be 
carried out in an amount not to exceed the amount specified for that 
project:
            (1) Seismic corrections to buildings, including 
        retrofitting and replacement of high-risk buildings, in San 
        Francisco, California, in an amount not to exceed $180,480,000.
            (2) Seismic corrections to facilities, including facilities 
        to support homeless veterans, at the medical center in West Los 
        Angeles, California, in an amount not to exceed $105,500,000.
            (3) Seismic corrections to the mental health and community 
        living center in Long Beach, California, in an amount not to 
        exceed $287,100,000.
            (4) Construction of an outpatient clinic, administrative 
        space, cemetery, and columbarium in Alameda, California, in an 
        amount not to exceed $87,332,000.
            (5) Realignment of medical facilities in Livermore, 
        California, in an amount not to exceed $194,430,000.
            (6) Construction of a medical center in Louisville, 
        Kentucky, in an amount not to exceed $150,000,000.
            (7) Construction of a replacement community living center 
        in Perry Point, Maryland, in an amount not to exceed 
        $92,700,000.
            (8) Seismic corrections and other renovations to several 
        buildings and construction of a specialty care building in 
        American Lake, Washington, in an amount not to exceed 
        $16,260,000.

        authorization of appropriations in subsection (c);
