amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(m) Cooperative Associations That Support Rural Infrastructure 
Development.--Each Federal Home Loan Bank is authorized to purchase 
investment-grade securities from nonmember lenders that are organized 
as cooperatives and that have received financing from the Federal 
Financing Bank and that have demonstrated experience in making loans to 
cooperatives that are eligible to receive loans or commitments for 
loans from the Rural Utilities Service (or any successor agency). Such 
securities shall be secured investments collateralized by loans of the 
cooperative lender. The purchase of such securities shall be at the 
sole discretion of each Federal Home Loan Bank, consistent with such 
regulations, restrictions, and limitations as may be prescribed by the 
Agency.''.
