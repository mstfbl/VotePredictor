                    ``(D) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any 
                taxable year beginning after December 31, 2015, the 
                dollar amounts in subparagraph (A) shall be increased 
                by an amount equal to--
                            ``(i) such amount, multiplied by
                            ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment 
                        determined under section 1(f)(3) for the 
                        calendar year in which such taxable year begins

                        thereof.
                If any increase determined under this paragraph is not
