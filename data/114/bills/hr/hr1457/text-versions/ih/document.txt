To amend title 17, United States Code, to provide for direct payment of 
 statutory sound recording performance royalties to record producers, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Allocation for Music Producers Act'' 
or the ``AMP Act''.

SEC. 2. PAYMENT OF STATUTORY PERFORMANCE ROYALTIES.

    (a) Letter of Direction.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Letter of direction.--A collective designated by the 
        Copyright Royalty Judges to distribute receipts from the 
        licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) 
        shall adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides, in 
        circumstances determined by the collective to be appropriate, 
        for acceptance of instructions from a payee identified in 
        subparagraph (A) or (D) of paragraph (2) to distribute a 
        portion of the payments to which the payee otherwise would be 
        entitled from the licensing of transmissions of a particular 
        sound recording to a producer, mixer, or sound engineer who was 
        part of the creative process that created the sound recording 
        (in this section, referred to as a `letter of direction'). To 
        the extent that the collective accepts a letter of direction, 
        the person entitled to payment pursuant to such letter of 
        direction shall, during the time such letter of direction is in 
        effect and followed by the collective, be treated for all 
        purposes as the owner of the right to receive such payment. 
        This paragraph shall not be interpreted to imply that a 
        collective cannot accept or act upon payment instructions in 
        other circumstances.''.
    (b) Additional Provisions for Recordings Fixed Before November 1, 
1995.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United States Code, as amended by 
subsection (a), is further amended by adding at the end the following 
new paragraph:

                adopt and reasonably implement a policy that provides,

                recording fixed before November 1, 1995, from receipts 
                otherwise payable to the recording artist or artists 
                featured on such sound recording (or the persons 
                conveying rights in the artists' performance in the 
                sound recordings) pursuant to paragraph (2)(D) (which 
                leaves the recording artist or artists featured on such
