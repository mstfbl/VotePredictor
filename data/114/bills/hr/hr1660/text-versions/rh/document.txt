        otherwise.
    ``(c) Rights and Duties.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law and except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered savings 
association shall--
            ``(1) have the same rights and privileges as a national

        the home office of the covered savings association; and
            ``(2) be subject to the same duties, restrictions,

            ``(2) that require a Federal savings association that makes 
        an election under subsection (b) to identify specific assets 
        and subsidiaries--
                    ``(A) that do not conform to the requirements for 
                assets and subsidiaries of a national bank; and
                    ``(B) that are held by the Federal savings

                association to provide a justification for 
                grandfathering such assets and subsidiaries after 
                electing to operate as a covered savings association;
            ``(4) that establish standards and procedures to allow a 
        covered savings association to terminate an election under 
        subsection (b) after an appropriate period of time or to make a 
        subsequent election;
            ``(5) that clarify requirements for the treatment of 
        covered savings associations, including the provisions of law 
        that apply to covered savings associations; and
            ``(6) as the Comptroller deems necessary and in the 
        interests of safety and soundness.''.
