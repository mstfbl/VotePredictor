                through 2021.
    (b) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers 
                continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- 
                and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
                federally assisted surface transportation markets 
                across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.
            (2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following 
        definitions apply:
                    (A) Small business concern.--
                            (i) In general.--The term ``small business 
                        concern'' means a small business concern (as 
                        the term is used in section 3 of the Small 
                        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).
                            (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``small business 
                        concern'' does not include any concern or group 
                        of concerns controlled by the same socially and 
                        economically disadvantaged individual or 
                        individuals that have average annual gross 
                        receipts during the preceding 3 fiscal years in 
                        excess of $23,980,000, as adjusted annually by 
                        the Secretary for inflation.
                    (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals.--The term ``socially and economically 
                disadvantaged individuals'' has the meaning given the 
                term in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 
                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations 
                issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be 
                presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals for purposes of this subsection.
            (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the 
        extent that the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 
        10 percent of the amounts made available for any program under 
        titles I, II, III, and VI of this Act and section 403 of title 
        23, United States Code, shall be expended through small 
        business concerns owned and controlled by socially and 
        economically disadvantaged individuals.
            (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.--
        Each State shall annually--
                    (A) survey and compile a list of the small business 
                concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the State, 
                including the location of the small business concerns 
                in the State; and
                    (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the 
                percentage of the small business concerns that are 
                controlled by--
                            (i) women;
                            (ii) socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individuals (other than women); 
                        and
                            (iii) individuals who are women and are 
                        otherwise socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individuals.
            (5) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish 
                minimum uniform criteria for use by State governments 
                in certifying whether a concern qualifies as a small 
                business concern for the purpose of this subsection.
                    (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall include, with 
                respect to a potential small business concern--
                            (i) on-site visits;
                            (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                            (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;
                            (iv) analyses of stock ownership;

                            (vii) listings of work completed;
                            (viii) examination of the resumes of

                            (x) analyses of the type of work preferred.
            (6) Reporting.--The Secretary shall establish minimum 
        requirements for use by State governments in reporting to the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) information concerning disadvantaged business 
                enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and
                    (B) such other information as the Secretary 
                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under titles I, II, III, and VI of 
        this Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if 
        the entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
        complying with paragraph (3) because a Federal court issues a 
        final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the 
        implementation of paragraph (3) is unconstitutional.

                by the Secretary (or apportioned by the Secretary under

                (a) for the fiscal year, less the aggregate of amounts 
                not distributed under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this

                appropriated for the programs that are apportioned 
                under title 23, United States Code, to all States for 
                the fiscal year.
    (d) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (c), the Secretary shall, after August 1 of each of fiscal 
years 2016 through 2021--
            (1) revise a distribution of the obligation authority made 
        available under subsection (c) if an amount distributed cannot 
        be obligated during that fiscal year; and
            (2) redistribute sufficient amounts to those States able to 
        obligate amounts in addition to those previously distributed 
        during that fiscal year, giving priority to those States having 
        large unobligated balances of funds apportioned under sections 
        144 (as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of 
        MAP-21 (Public Law 112-141)) and 104 of title 23, United States

                    (B) title VI of this Act.
            (2) Exception.--Obligation authority made available under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) remain available for a period of 4 fiscal 
                years; and
                    (B) be in addition to the amount of any limitation 
                imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and 
                highway safety construction programs for future fiscal 
                years.
    (f) Redistribution of Certain Authorized Funds.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        distribution of obligation authority under subsection (c) for 
        each of fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the Secretary shall 
        distribute to the States any funds (excluding funds authorized 
        for the program under section 202 of title 23, United States 
        Code) that--
                    (A) are authorized to be appropriated for the 
                fiscal year for Federal-aid highway programs; and
                    (B) the Secretary determines will not be allocated 
                to the States (or will not be apportioned to the States 
                under section 204 of title 23, United States Code), and 
                will not be available for obligation, for the fiscal 
                year because of the imposition of any obligation 
                limitation for the fiscal year.
            (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 
        in the same proportion as the distribution of obligation 
        authority under subsection (c)(5).
            (3) Availability.--Funds distributed to each State under 
        paragraph (1) shall be available for any purpose described in 
        section 133(b) of title 23, United States Code.

SEC. 1103. DEFINITIONS.

    Section 101 of title 23, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking paragraph (29);

        after the year in which the Secretary implements a new 
        allocation formula under section 5106 of the Surface 
        Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015, and this 
        adjusted baseline will replace the maintenance of effort 
        requirement under paragraph (1).

        may waive or modify the requirements of this subsection for a 
        total of 1 fiscal year if the Secretary determines that the 
        waiver or modification is reasonable, based on circumstances 
        described by the State, to ensure the continuation of 
        commercial motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State.

                motor vehicle can significantly affect the safe 
                operation of the vehicle, or at ports where intermodal 
                shipping containers enter and leave the United States;

                higher percentage will result in significant increases 
                in commercial motor vehicle safety.

        year, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and after making a 
        deduction under section 31104(c), the Secretary shall allocate 
        amounts made available under section 31104(a)(1) to carry out 
        this section for the fiscal year among the States with plans 
        approved under this section in accordance with the criteria 
        prescribed under paragraph (1).

        funding and notwithstanding fluctuations in the data elements 
        used by the Secretary to calculate the annual allocation 
        amounts, after the creation of a new allocation formula under 
        section 5106 of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and 
        Reform Act of 2015 the Secretary may not make elective 
        adjustments to the allocation formula that decrease a State's 
        Federal funding levels by more than 3 percent in a fiscal year.

                not being followed or has become inadequate to ensure 
                enforcement of State regulations, standards, or orders

        administrative or a judicial proceeding that commenced before

        necessary) under section 31104(a)(1) of title 49, United States 
        Code, as amended by this subtitle, by using the following 
        methodology:
                    (A) The Secretary shall calculate the funding 
                amount to a State using the allocation formula the 
                Secretary used to award motor carrier safety assistance 
                program funding in fiscal year 2016 under section 31102

            (2) Adjustments.--Subject to the availability of funding 
        and notwithstanding fluctuations in the data elements used by 
        the Secretary, the initial amounts resulting from the 
        calculation described in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted to 
        ensure that, for each State, the amount shall not be less than 
        97 percent of the average amount of funding received or other 
        equitable amounts in fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for--
                    (A) motor carrier safety assistance program funds

SEC. 5107. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT CALCULATION.

    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--
            (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula for the 
        motor carrier safety assistance program has not been 
        established under this subtitle for fiscal year 2017, the 
        Secretary shall calculate for fiscal year 2017 the maintenance 
        of effort baseline required under section 31102(f) of title 49, 
        United States Code, as amended by this subtitle, by averaging 
        the expenditures for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 required by 
        section 31102(b)(4) of title 49, United States Code, as that 
        section was in effect on the day before the date of enactment 
        of this Act.
            (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may use the 
        methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort baseline 
        specified in paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2018 and subsequent 
        fiscal years if a new allocation formula for the motor carrier 
        safety assistance program has not been established for that 
        fiscal year.
    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)(B), 
        beginning on the date that a new allocation formula for the 
        motor carrier safety assistance program is established under 
        this subtitle, upon the request of a State, the Secretary may 
        waive or modify the baseline maintenance of effort required of 
        the State by section 31102(e) of title 49, United States Code, 
        as amended by this subtitle, for the purpose of establishing a 
        new baseline maintenance of effort if the Secretary determines 
        that a waiver or modification--
                    (A) is equitable due to reasonable circumstances;
                    (B) will ensure the continuation of commercial 
                motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State; and
                    (C) is necessary to ensure that the total amount of 
                State maintenance of effort and matching expenditures 
                required under sections 31102 and 31104 of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by this subtitle, does 
                not exceed a sum greater than the average of the total 
                amount of State maintenance of effort and matching 
                expenditures required under those sections for the 3 
                fiscal years prior to the date of enactment of this 
                Act.
            (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a State, the 
        Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort baseline 
        referred to in paragraph (1) for the State according to the 
        following methodology:
                    (A) The Secretary shall establish the maintenance 
                of effort baseline for the State using the average 
                baseline of fiscal years 2004 and 2005, as required by 
                section 31102(b)(4) of title 49, United States Code, as 
                that section was in effect on the day before the date 
                of enactment of this Act.
                    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average 
                required match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle 
                safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for 
                motor carrier safety assistance grants established at 
                20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, United States 
                Code, as that section was in effect on the day before 
                the date of enactment of this Act.
                    (C) The Secretary shall calculate the estimated 
                match required under section 31104(b) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by this subtitle.
                    (D) The Secretary shall subtract the amount in 
                subparagraph (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) 
                and--
                            (i) if the number is greater than 0, the 
                        Secretary shall subtract the number from the 
                        amount in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, 
                        the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance 
                        of effort using the methodology in subparagraph 
                        (A).
            (3) Maintenance of effort amount.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall use the amount 
                calculated under paragraph (2) as the baseline 
                maintenance of effort required under section 31102(f) 
                of title 49, United States Code, as amended by this 
                subtitle.
                    (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request a waiver 
                or modification under this subsection before September 
                30 during the first fiscal year that the Secretary 
                implements a new allocation formula for the motor 
                carrier safety assistance program under this subtitle, 
                the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance of effort 
                using the methodology described in paragraph (2)(A).
            (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of 
        effort calculated under this section is the amount required 
        under section 31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as 
        amended by this subtitle.
    (c) Termination of Effectiveness.--The authority of the Secretary 
under this section shall terminate effective on the date that a new 
maintenance of effort baseline is calculated based on a new allocation 
formula for the motor carrier safety assistance program implemented 
under section 31102 of title 49, United States Code.
