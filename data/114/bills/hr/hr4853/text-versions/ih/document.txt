   To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to revise certain 
     accreditation requirements applied under the Medicare program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Accreditation For 
Everyone Act of 2016'' or the ``SAFE Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. REVISION OF CERTAIN MEDICARE ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS.

    Section 1865 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395bb) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the American 
                Osteopathic Association or any other national'' and 
                inserting ``a national''; and
                    (B) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:
    ``(2) In making such a finding, with respect to a national 
accreditation body, the Secretary shall consider whether the 
accreditation program of such national accreditation body provides 
reasonable assurance, when taken as a whole, that the requirements are 
equivalent to or exceed the purposes of the conditions of participation 
applicable to the provider entity for which the accreditation body has 
made a request for a finding under paragraph (1). The Secretary may 
consider the standards for accreditation and survey procedures relevant 
to the purposes of the conditions of participation, and additional 
factors such as the ability of the accreditation body to provide 
adequate resources for conducting required surveys and supplying 
information for use in enforcement activities, its monitoring 
procedures for provider entities found out of compliance with the 
conditions, and the ability of the accreditation body to provide the 
Secretary with necessary data for validation surveys.''; and
            (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the American 
        Osteopathic Association, or any other national accreditation 
        body'' and inserting ``any national accreditation body''.
                                 <all>
