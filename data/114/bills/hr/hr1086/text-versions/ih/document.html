    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue or revise medical certification regulations 
to ensure that an individual may operate as pilot in command of a 
covered aircraft without regard to any medical certification or proof 
of health requirement otherwise applicable under Federal law if--
            (1) the individual possesses a valid State driver's license 
        and complies with any medical requirement associated with that 
        license;
            (2) the individual is transporting not more than 5 
        passengers;
            (3) the individual is operating under visual flight rules 
        or instrument flight rules; and
            (4) the relevant flight, including each portion thereof, is 
        not carried out--
                    (A) for compensation, including that no passenger 
                or property on the flight is being carried for 
                compensation;
                    (B) at an altitude that is more than 14,000 feet 
                above mean sea level;
                    (C) outside the United States, unless authorized by 
                the country in which the flight is conducted; or
                    (D) at an indicated air speed exceeding 250 knots.
    (b) Covered Aircraft Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered 
aircraft'' means an aircraft that--
            (1) is not authorized under Federal law to carry more than 
        6 occupants; and
            (2) has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more 
        than 6000 pounds.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than 5 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a 
report that describes the effect of the regulations issued or revised 
under subsection (a) and includes statistics with respect to changes in 
small aircraft activity and safety incidents.
    (d) Prohibition on Enforcement Actions.--On and after the date that 
is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator may not take an enforcement action for not holding a 
valid third-class medical certificate against a pilot of a covered 
aircraft for a flight if the pilot and the flight meet the applicable 
requirements under paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) unless 
the Administrator has published final regulations in the Federal 
Register under subsection (a).
