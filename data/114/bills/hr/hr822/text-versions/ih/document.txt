                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require reporting of 
 certain data by providers and suppliers of air ambulance services for 
   purposes of reforming reimbursements for such services under the 
               Medicare program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Air medical critical care transport is an essential 
        component of the healthcare system.
            (2) The presence of air medical services in rural areas 
        provides tens of millions of rural Americans with access to 
        critical care within an hour of injury.
            (3) As an emergency responder, air medical providers must 
        maintain readiness 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.
            (4) Air medical providers transport all emergent patients 
        for which they are dispatched regardless of insurance status or 
        ability to pay.
            (5) The air ambulance fee schedule under the Medicare 
        program was first implemented in 2002 and developed through 
        negotiated rulemaking, which required the new fee schedule to 
        be created in a budget neutral manner. As such, the Medicare 
        air ambulance fee schedule has never reflected true costs.
            (6) Since the implementation of the air ambulance fee 
        schedule under the Medicare program, reimbursements have only 
        been adjusted by inflationary updates averaging 2.2 percent a 
        year.
            (7) Operational readiness and safety enhancement costs have 
        grown at a far faster rate than the Medicare inflationary 
        updates, creating a fundamental imbalance within the air 
        ambulance fee schedule.
            (8) It is imperative that balance be restored to the air 
        ambulance fee schedule to preserve access to timely care for 
        tens of millions of Americans.

SEC. 2. AIR AMBULANCE DATA REPORTING PROGRAM.

    Section 1834(l) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(l)) is

        and inserting ``subparagraph (C) and paragraph (16)''; and

                        may result in payment rates under the fee 
                        schedule under this subsection for a year being 
                        less than such payment rates for the preceding 
                        year.
                    ``(B) Noncumulative application.--Any reduction 
                under subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to 
                the year involved and the Secretary shall not take into

                under the fee schedule under this subsection for a 
                subsequent year.
