                                 A BILL


 
 To permit the chief executive of a State to create an exemption from 
  certain requirements of Federal environmental laws for producers of 
           agricultural commodities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Flexibility to Farm Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The agricultural community of the United States serves 
        as the economic backbone of many communities and employs 
        millions of Americans.
            (2) In recent years, one-size-fits-all policies issued by 
        the Environmental Protection Agency have increased 
        dramatically, requiring agricultural producers to focus on 
        regulation compliance rather than on growing the world's 
        healthiest, most abundant food supply.
            (3) Attempts by the Environmental Protection Agency to 
        expand the definition of ``Waters of the United States'' under 
        the Federal Water Pollution Control Act expand the scope of 
        Federal jurisdiction under that Act well beyond the intent of 
        Congress, and would eliminate a central precept of that Act, 
        which reserves certain waters to the exclusive jurisdiction of 
        the States.
            (4) The Environmental Protection Agency's proposed 
        revisions to the existing National Ambient Air Quality 
        Standards (NAAQS) for ozone would impose significant costs on 
        agriculture and rural counties.
            (5) An increasing number of poultry and livestock 
        operations have been forced to apply for permits under the 
        National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System resulting from 
        the Environmental Protection Agency's expanding definition of 
        what constitutes a discharge under the Federal Water Pollution 
        Control Act.
            (6) Duplicative and costly permitting requirements under 
        the Federal Water Pollution Control Act will require additional 
        National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits for 
        pesticide applications, subjecting pesticide users to 
        unnecessary red tape and financial burdens while exposing them 
        to the threat of unfounded litigation.
            (7) The Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to 
        limit greenhouse gas emissions under section 111(d) of the 
        Clean Air Act threaten the reliability and affordability of our 
        Nation's electricity supply and would impose an undue burden on 
        agricultural producers.
            (8) The Federal Government should not impose further rules 
        or regulations that are overly burdensome or cause economic 
        hardship for the agricultural community.

SEC. 3. UNDULY BURDENSOME REGULATIONS EXEMPTION.

    (a) In General.--If the chief executive of a State determines, in 
accordance with this section, that a requirement of a covered Federal

capacity as farmers, such requirement or regulation shall not apply to 
persons in the State acting in that capacity.

subsection (a), the chief executive of a State shall solicit and accept
