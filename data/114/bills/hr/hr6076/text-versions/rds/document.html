                            December 8, 2016

                                Received

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
  To require the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space 
   Administration to establish a program for the medical monitoring, 
    diagnosis, and treatment of astronauts, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``To Research, Evaluate, Assess, and 
Treat Astronauts Act'' or the ``TREAT Astronauts Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Human space exploration can pose significant challenges 
        and is full of substantial risk, which has ultimately claimed 
        the lives of 24 National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
        astronauts serving in the line of duty.
            (2) As United States government astronauts participate in 
        long-duration and exploration spaceflight missions they may 
        experience increased health risks, such as vision impairment, 
        bone demineralization, and behavioral health and performance 
        risks, and may be exposed to galactic cosmic radiation. 
        Exposure to high levels of radiation and microgravity can 
        result in acute and long-term health consequences that can 
        increase the risk of cancer and tissue degeneration and have 
        potential effects on the musculoskeletal system, central 
        nervous system, cardiovascular system, immune function, and 
        vision.
            (3) To advance the goal of long-duration and exploration 
        spaceflight missions, United States government astronaut Scott 
        Kelly participated in a 1-year twins study in space while his 
        identical twin brother, former United States government 
        astronaut Mark Kelly, acted as a human control specimen on 
        Earth, providing an understanding of the physical, behavioral, 
        microbiological, and molecular reaction of the human body to an 
        extended period of time in space.
            (4) Since the Administration currently provides medical 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment for United States 
        government astronauts during their active employment, given the 
        unknown long-term health consequences of long-duration space 
        exploration, the Administration has requested statutory 
        authority from Congress to provide medical monitoring, 
        diagnosis, and treatment to former United States government 
        astronauts for psychological and medical conditions associated 
        with human space flight.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should continue to seek the unknown 
        and lead the world in space exploration and scientific 
        discovery as the Administration prepares for long-duration and 
        exploration spaceflight in deep space and an eventual mission 
        to Mars;
            (2) data relating to the health of astronauts will become 
        increasingly valuable to improving our understanding of many 
        diseases humans face on Earth;
            (3) the Administration should provide the type of 
        monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment described in subsection 
        (a) only for conditions the Administration considers unique to 
        the training or exposure to the spaceflight environment of 
        United States government astronauts and should not require any 
        former United States government astronauts to participate in 
        the Administration's monitoring;
            (4) such monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment should not 
        replace a former United States government astronaut's private 
        health insurance;
            (5) expanded data acquired from such monitoring, diagnosis, 
        and treatment should be used to tailor treatment, inform the 
        requirements for new spaceflight medical hardware, and develop 
        controls in order to prevent disease occurrence in the 
        astronaut corps; and
            (6) the 340-day space mission of Scott Kelly aboard the 
        ISS--
                    (A) was pivotal for the goal of the United States 
                for humans to explore deep space and Mars as the 
                mission generated new insight into how the human body 
                adjusts to weightlessness, isolation, radiation, and 
                the stress of long-duration space flight; and
                    (B) will help support the physical and mental well-
                being of astronauts during longer space exploration 
                missions in the future.

SEC. 3. MEDICAL MONITORING AND RESEARCH RELATING TO HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT.

    ``(c) Exclusions.--The Administrator may not--
            ``(1) provide for medical monitoring or diagnosis of a 
        former United States government astronaut or former payload
