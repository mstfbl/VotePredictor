  To require an Exchange established under the Patient Protection and 
  Affordable Care Act to notify individuals in the case that personal 
   information of such individuals is known to have been acquired or 
    accessed as a result of a breach of the security of any system 
          maintained by the Exchange, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

Notification Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION TO INDIVIDUALS OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING 
              ACQUIRED OR ACCESSED AS A RESULT OF A BREACH OF SYSTEM 
              SECURITY.

    After the discovery of a breach of security of any system 
maintained by an Exchange established pursuant to section 1321(c) of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), 
the Exchange shall, as soon as possible but in no instance later than
