            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of

        eligible for the program established under subsection

        humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, due to 
        exceptional service in the United States Armed Forces, or if 
        such waiver otherwise is in the public interest.

SEC. 4. PROTECTING VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS FROM REMOVAL.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 237

through service in the Armed Forces of the United States under sections 
328 and 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1439; 
1440), except that--
            (1) the ground or grounds on which the noncitizen was 
        ordered removed, or removed, from the United States, or was 
        rendered inadmissible to, or deportable from, the United 
        States, shall be disregarded when determining whether the 
        noncitizen is a person of good moral character; and
            (2) any period of absence from the United States due to the 
        noncitizen having been removed, or being inadmissible, shall be

        requirement relating to continuous residence or physical 
        presence.

SEC. 6. ACCESS TO MILITARY BENEFITS.

    A noncitizen who has obtained the status of a noncitizen lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence pursuant to section 2 shall be

ordered removed, been removed, or voluntarily departed, from the United 
States.

SEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION.

    (a) Identification.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
identify cases involving service members and veterans at risk of 
removal from the United States by--
            (1) inquiring of every noncitizen processed prior to 
        initiating removal proceedings whether the noncitizen is 
        serving, or has served, as a member of a regular or reserve 
        component of the Armed Forces of the United States on active 
        duty or as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces

            (3) keeping records of service members and veterans who 
        have had removal proceedings against them initiated, been 
        detained, or been removed.
    (b) Record Annotation.--When the Secretary has identified a case 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall annotate all immigration and 
naturalization records of the Department of Homeland Security relating 
to the noncitizen involved so as to reflect that identification and 
afford an opportunity to track the outcomes for the noncitizen. Such 
annotation shall include--
            (1) the individual's branch of military service;
            (2) whether or not the individual is serving, or has 
        served, during a period of military hostilities described in 
        section 329 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1440);
            (3) the individual's immigration status at the time of 
        enlistment;

        separated under honorable conditions; and
            (5) the basis for which removal was sought; and, if the 
        basis for removal was a criminal conviction, the crime or 
        crimes for which conviction was obtained.
