  To authorize States to carry out bridge construction, maintenance, 
  repair, and replacement projects using previously allocated surface 
 transportation funds that are identified as being excess or inactive, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Highway Administration estimates that there 
        are 604,485 bridges on the Nation's public road network, of 
        which 116,669 are on the National Highway System.
            (2) The average age of the Nation's bridges is 39 years old 
        and more than two-thirds of the Nation's bridges are more than 
        26 years old.
            (3) One in 9 bridges is classified as structurally 
        deficient and requires significant maintenance, repair, or 
        replacement.
            (4) Fourteen percent of the Nation's bridges are 
        functionally obsolete and do not meet current design standards.
            (5) The Federal Highway Administration estimates that to 
        eliminate the Nation's deficient bridge backlog by 2030, $20.2 
        billion of investment would be required annually through 
        Federal, State, and local levels of government, although 
        current annual bridge investment is approximately $17.1 
        billion.
