        the Secretary, or
            (2) if after the expiration of such 60-day period no such 
        joint resolution has been enacted, then the rate of tax for the 
        current taxable years shall be the rate of tax that was in 
        effect for such preceding taxable years.

under this section shall meet the following requirements:
            (1) Such resolution shall not have a preamble.
