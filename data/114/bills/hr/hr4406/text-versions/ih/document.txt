        enforcement in preventing human trafficking during the course 
        of their primary roles and responsibilities; and
            (2) ensure that such personnel regularly receive current 
        information on matters related to the detection of human 
        trafficking, including information that becomes available 
        outside of the Department's initial or periodic retraining 
        schedule, to the extent relevant to their official duties and
