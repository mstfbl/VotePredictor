   and discriminatory mass incarceration, to determine the role that 
   private corporations played in the prison industrial complex, to

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Commission to Study Family 
Reconstruction Proposals for African-Americans Unjustly Impacted by the 
`War on Drugs' Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT AND DUTIES.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established the Commission to Study 
Family Reconstruction Proposals for African-Americans Unjustly Impacted 
by the ``War on Drugs'' (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the 
``Commission'').
    (b) Duties.--The Commission shall perform the following duties:
            (1) Examine the disparate incarceration and the institution 
        of forced prison labor which has existed within the African-
        American community in the United States since the ratification 
        of Amendment XIII to the United States Constitution on December 
        6, 1865. The Commission's examination shall include an 
        examination of--
                    (A) the rates of arrest and imprisonment of 
                African-Americans compared to the broader American 
                public for drug crimes;
                    (B) the rates at which African-Americans were 
                imprisoned for comparable crimes to non-African-
                Americans;
                    (C) the rates at which African-Americans were 
                imprisoned due to mandatory minimums and how these 
                minimums differed from comparable charges; and
                    (D) the financial and sociological impact of these 
                conditions on African-American prisoners and their 
                families.
            (2) Examine the extent to which the Federal and State 
        governments of the United States have supported the mass 
        incarceration of African-Americans, the extent to which such 
        governments have profited, both through cost-savings and direct 
        revenue, and the extent to which said revenue was used to 
        reduce recidivism and encourage post-incarceration 
        reintegration.
            (3) Examine the extent to which private corporations have 
        supported the mass incarceration of African-Americans, the 
        extent to which such corporations have profited, both through 
        cost-savings and direct revenue, and the extent to which said 
        revenue was used to reduce recidivism and encourage post-
        incarceration reintegration.
            (4) Examine Federal and State laws that have discriminated 
        against African-American prisoners and their families.
            (5) Examine other forms of discrimination in the public and 
        private sectors against freed African-American prisoners and 
        their families.
            (6) Examine the lingering negative effects of the mass 
        incarceration of African-Americans.
            (7) Recommend appropriate ways to educate the American 
        public of the Commission's findings.
            (8) Recommend appropriate remedies in consideration of the 
        Commission's findings on the matters described in paragraphs 
        (1), (2), (3), and (4). In making such recommendations, the 
        Commission shall address among other issues, the following 
        questions:
                    (A) Whether the Government of the United States 
                should offer a formal apology on behalf of the people 
                of the United States to the African-American victims of 
                the ``War on Drugs'' and their descendants.
                    (B) Whether African-Americans and the broader 
                African-American community still suffer from the 
                lingering effects of the matters described in 
                paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4).
                    (C) Whether, in consideration of the Commission's 
                findings, any form of compensation to the victims of 
                the ``War on Drugs'' and their descendants is 
                warranted.
                    (D) If the Commission finds that such compensation 
                is warranted, what should be the amount of 
                compensation, what form of compensation should be 
                awarded, and who should be eligible for such 
                compensation.
