                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit the President from using funds appropriated under section 
  1304 of title 31, United States Code, to make payments to Iran, to 
 impose sanctions with respect to Iranian persons that hold or detain 
            United States citizens, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Ransom Payments Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As of August 8, 2016, United States courts had awarded 
        more than $55,000,000,000 in terrorism-related judgments 
        against Iran to plaintiffs under the terrorism exception to the 
        jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state under section 1605A 
        of title 28, United States Code.
            (2) Such judgments against Iran include judgments relating 
        to Iran's involvement in the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in 
        Lebanon, a hostage-taking in Lebanon in 1984, a 1990 
        assassination in New York City, the 1996 Khobar Towers attack, 
        the 1998 attacks on two United States Embassies in Africa, and 
        various terrorist bombings in Jerusalem.
            (3) On November 4, 1979, more than 60 Americans were 
        captured at the United States Embassy in Tehran. Fifty-two 
        Americans were held hostage by the Islamic Republic of Iran for 
        444 days. On December 18, 2015, President Barack Obama signed 
        into law the Justice for United States Victims of State 
        Sponsored Terrorism Act (42 U.S.C. 10609) and established the 
        United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund to 
        compensate United States victims of terrorism who either hold a 
        final judgment issued against a state sponsor of terrorism 
        under the terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign 
        Immunities Act, or were taken hostage from the United States 
        Embassy in Tehran, Iran, in 1979, or are a spouse or child of 
        someone who was taken hostage. As of August 8, 2016, the United 
        States Government has failed to provide any of the compensation 
        authorized under the Justice for United States Victims of State 
        Sponsored Terrorism Act.
            (4) On January 17, 2016, President Barack Obama announced 
        that 4 United States citizens (Jason Rezaian, Saeed Abedini, 
        Amir Hekmati, and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari) unjustly held 
        by Iran and one United States citizen (Matthew Trevithick) who 
        had been detained by Iran, but not charged, had been released 
        in exchange for the release of 7 Iranian nationals jailed or 
        facing charges in the United States and that the United States 
        dropped its request with Interpol relating to 14 Iranian 
        nationals. At the same time the United States announced a 
        settlement of an Iranian claim for $1,700,000,000, consisting 
        of $400,000,000 held in a foreign military sales account since 
        the 1979 Iranian revolution and a settlement of $1,300,000,000 
        in interest.
            (5) On April 5, 2016, White House Spokesperson Josh 
        Earnest, in response to a question from a reporter about 
        whether the Obama administration misled Congress about the Iran 
        deal, stated: ``I don't think there's any evidence to 
        substantiate that kind of claim . . . I think you should take a 
        rather dim view of that suggestion because Congressman Pompeo . 
        . . didn't approve the deal and certainly didn't vote in favor 
        of it.''.
            (6) On June 9, 2016, Bloomberg News reported that Iran 
        instructed its Central Bank to transfer $1,700,000,000 to the 
        military of Iran, probably a reference to the payment described 
        in paragraph (4). Overall, Iran's military budget for 2017 
        increased to $19,000,000,000, an increase of 90 percent from 
        2016.
            (7) On August 3, 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported 
        that the United States had airlifted $400,000,000 in cash to 
        Iran in wooden pallets with euros, Swiss francs, and other 
        currencies in an unmarked cargo plane, which was later 
        clarified to reportedly be an Iran Air cargo plane. The report 
        stated that the money came from the central banks of the 
        Netherlands and Switzerland.
            (8) On August 4, 2016, Saeed Abedini said in an interview 
        on FOX Business Network that the hostages had to wait overnight 
        at the airport because they were unable to leave until another 
        plane arrived in Iran; the hostages left on a plane that had 
        been at the airport the entire time.
            (9) General Mohammad Reza Naghdi, a commander in the 
        Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, stated that ``taking this 
        money back was in return for the release of the American 
        spies''.
            (10) On August 3, 2016, State Department Deputy 
        Spokesperson Mark Toner stated that ``there was no quid pro 
        quo'' in reaction to a question regarding the statement in 
        paragraph (8).
            (11) On August 3, 2016, White House Spokesperson Josh 
        Earnest stated ``A week delay [in sequencing the payments to 
        not be perceived as a quid pro quo] would not have prevented 
        [Speaker] Paul Ryan and [Senator] Marco Rubio from falsely 
        claiming that they're a ransom.''. At the same press 
        conference, Earnest stated ``So it sounds to me like [Ryan and 
        Rubio] are once again in a position where they're making the 
        same argument as hardliners in Iran in an effort to undermine 
        the Iran nuclear agreement. The President made clear a year ago 
        that right-wingers in the United States were making common 
        cause with right-wingers in the Iranian government. And, again, 
        if they're doing it again to try to justify their opposition to 
        an agreement that has benefitted the American people, they can 
        do that, but I think that's going to be pretty hard for them to 
        explain. Maybe there's another letter from Senator Cotton to 
        the Supreme Leader we don't know about.''.
            (12) On August 4, 2016, State Department Deputy 
        Spokesperson Mark Toner stated ``The idea that this was all 
        orchestrated as part of some kind of quid pro quo is just not 
        accurate . . . I recognize, I can see, the optics of this and 
        that people would draw assumptions. People do. We can't keep 
        them from doing so, but it's just not true that there's any 
        linkage.''.
            (13) On August 18, 2016, State Department Spokesperson John 
        Kirby, in response to a question on whether the United States 
        Government would not give Iran the $400,000,000 in cash until 
        the United States citizens were released stated ``that's 
        correct''.
            (14) On June 24, 2015, President Barack Obama issued a 
        Presidential Policy Directive on Hostage Recovery Activities 
        (referred to as ``PPD 30''), which states: ``The United States 
        will use every appropriate resource to gain the safe return of 
        U.S. nationals who are held hostage. But the United States 
        Government will make no concessions to individuals or groups 
        holding U.S. nationals hostage. It is United States policy to 
        deny hostage-takers the benefits of ransom, prisoner releases, 
        policy changes, or other acts of concession. This policy 
        protects U.S. nationals and strengthens national security by 
        removing a key incentive for hostage-takers to target U.S. 
        nationals, thereby interrupting the vicious cycle of hostage-
        takings, and by helping to deny terrorists and other malicious 
        actors the money, personnel, and other resources they need to 
        conduct attacks against the United States, its nationals, and 
        its interests.''.
            (15) On January 27, 2014, the United Nations Security 
        Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2133, which ``calls upon 
        all Member States to prevent terrorists from benefiting 
        directly or indirectly from ransom payments or from political 
        considerations and to secure the safe release of hostages''.
            (16) On May 17, 2016, in a 6-2 decision, the United States 
        Supreme Court rejected a challenge by the Central Bank of Iran 
        to invalidate section 502 of the Iran Threat Reduction and 
        Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8772), which makes 
        Iran's bonds frozen in a New York account available to enforce 
        terrorism judgments.
            (17) As of August 8, 2016, Iran has illegally detained 
        three dual Iranian-American citizens, Siamak Namazi, his father 
        Baquer, and Reza ``Robin'' Shahini.
            (18) Robert Levinson, a United States citizen, disappeared 
        on March 9, 2007, after traveling to Kish Island, Iran, and is 
        the longest held United States civilian in the history of the 
        United States and Iran has not abided by the repeated pledges 
        by and renewed commitment of officials of the Government of 
        Iran to provide their Government's assistance in the case of 
        Robert Levinson.

SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.

        Iran's claims against the United States; and
            (2) to prohibit hostage-takers from the benefits of ransom 
        by ensuring that the United States Government does not pay

        the release of unjustly detained United States citizens,

        Act (42 U.S.C. 10609).

                the date on which the committee has been discharged 
                under paragraph (3) from further consideration of the 
                resolution, it is in order for any Member of the 
                respective House to move to proceed to the 
                consideration of the resolution if such Member 
                announced on a previous day to the House concerned the 
                Member's intention to do so.
                    (B) Points of order.--All points of order against 
                the joint resolution or against the consideration of 
                the resolution are waived.
                    (C) Effect of motion.--A motion described in 
                subparagraph (A) is highly privileged in the House of 
                Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is 
                not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, 
                or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed 
                to the consideration of other business. A motion to 
                reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
                disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is 
                agreed to, the respective House shall immediately 
                proceed to consideration of the resolution without 
                intervening motion, order, or other business, and the 
                resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the 
                respective House until disposed.
                    (D) Debate.--Debate on the joint resolution, and on 
                all debatable motions and appeals in connection with 
                the resolution, shall be limited to not more than 2 
                hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
                favoring and those opposing the resolution. An 
                amendment to the resolution is not in order. A motion 
                further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. 
                A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of other business, or a motion to 
                recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to 
                reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed 
                to or disagreed to is not in order.
                    (E) Final vote.--Immediately following the 
                conclusion of the debate on the joint resolution and a 
                single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the 
                appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the 
                resolution shall occur. In the Senate, adoption of the 
                joint resolution requires an affirmative vote of three-
                fifths of Senators, duly chosen and sworn.
                    (F) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the 
                Chair relating to the application of the rules of the 
                Senate or the House of Representatives to the procedure 
                relating to the joint resolution shall be decided 
                without debate.
                    (G) Consideration by other house.--
                            (i) In general.--If, before the passage by 
                        one House of a joint resolution of that House, 
                        that House receives a joint resolution from the 
                        other House, the following procedures shall 
                        apply:
                                    (I) The resolution of the other 
                                House shall not be referred to a 
                                committee and may not be considered in 
                                the House receiving it except in the 
                                case of final passage under subclause 
                                (II)(bb).
                                    (II) With respect to a joint 
                                resolution of the House receiving the 
                                resolution--
                                            (aa) the procedure in that 
                                        House shall be the same as if 
                                        no resolution had been received 
                                        from the other House; and
                                            (bb) the vote on final 
                                        passage shall be on the 
                                        resolution of the other House.
                            (ii) Effect on remaining joint 
                        resolution.--Upon disposition of the resolution 
                        received from the other House, it shall no 
                        longer be in order to consider the resolution 
                        that originated in the receiving House.

section is enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively;

        such rules; and
