                                 A BILL


 
  To increase Social Security and military retirement benefits by 2.9 
  percent, and base future cost-of-living increase adjustments to the 
                 Consumer Price Index for the elderly.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Seniors Deserve A Raise Act''.

SEC. 2. COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MILITARY 
              RETIREMENT AND SURVIVOR BENEFITS TO BE BASED ON CONSUMER 
              PRICE INDEX FOR THE ELDERLY.

    Notwithstanding the adjustments otherwise required by sections 
1401a, 1451(g)(1), 1451(h)(1), and 1452(a)(4)(B) of title 10, United 
States Code, and section 215(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
415(i)), whenever there is an increase in the Consumer Price Index for 
the elderly, published by the Department of Labor, that is greater than 
the previous increase in the Consumer Price Index, the dollar amounts 
in effect for the payment of the following benefits, as such amounts 
were in effect immediately before such increase, shall be increased by 
the same percentage as the Consumer Price Index for the elderly was 
increased above the prior Consumer Price Index increase:
            (1) Any old-age, survivors, or disability insurance benefit 
        under title II of the Social Security Act.
            (2) Any military retirement or survivor benefit program 
        administered pursuant to title 10, United States Code.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL ONE-TIME COST-OF-LIVING INCREASE TO COMPENSATE FOR 
              FAILURE TO BASE PAST INCREASES ON CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
              FOR THE ELDERLY.

    In addition to any increase required by section 2 for a year, each 
benefit described in such section shall be increased by 2.9 percent on 
January 1, 2016, and shall remain in effect every year thereafter.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
