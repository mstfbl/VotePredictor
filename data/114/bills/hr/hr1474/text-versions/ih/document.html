SEC. 2. REISSUANCE OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBERS TO YOUNG CHILDREN

    Section 205(c)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
405(c)(2)(B)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (iv); and
            (2) by inserting after clause (ii) the following new 
        clause:
    ``(iii) In any case in which a Social Security account number has 
been issued to a child who has not attained the age of 14 pursuant to 
subclause (IV) or (V) of clause (i) and it is demonstrated to the 
Commissioner of Social Security by a parent or guardian of the child 
that--
            ``(I) in the course of transmission of documentation of 
        such number to the child, the confidentiality of such number 
        has been compromised by reason of theft of such documentation, 
        or
            ``(II) in the course of public disclosure of information 
        regarding deceased individuals maintained by the Commissioner 
        of Social Security, the confidentiality of such number has been 
        compromised by reason of the inclusion of such number by 
        mistake as part of such public disclosure,
the Commissioner shall issue a new Social Security account number to 
such child and make note in the records maintained with respect to such 
child of the pertinent information received by the Commissioner 
regarding the theft of the documentation of the original number or the 
mistaken public disclosure of the original number.''.
