    ``(c) Subsidized Employment Demonstration Projects.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make grants to

        require each State that applies for a grant under this 
        subsection to do the following:
                    ``(A) Describe how wage subsidies will be provided 
                (such as whether paid directly to the employer or the 
                individual), the duration of the subsidies, the amount 
                of the subsidies, the structure of the subsidies, and 
                how employers will be recruited to participate in the 
                subsidized employment program.
                    ``(B) Describe how the State expects those 
                participating in subsidized employment to be able to 
                retain employment after the subsidy ends.
                    ``(C) Describe how the State will coordinate 
                subsidized employment funded under this subsection with 
                other efforts to help low-income individuals enter work 
                as conducted by the State.
            ``(3) Use of funds.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A State to which a grant is made 
                under this subsection may use the grant to subsidize 
                the wages of an eligible recipient for a period not 
                exceeding 12 months, and only to the extent that the 
                total of the funds paid under this project and any 
                other Federal funds so used with respect to the 
                recipient does not exceed 50 percent of the amount of 
                the wages received by the recipient during the period.

                subsidized with these funds;

                the same employer in an unsubsidized position in the 
                month immediately succeeding the month in which the 
                last subsidy payment was made with respect to the 
                employment; and
                    ``(C) describes the structure of the State

            ``(5) Evaluation.--The Secretary, in consultation with each

                    ``(A) Evaluator qualifications.--The Secretary may 
                not enter into a contract with an evaluator unless the

                rigorous evaluations of program effectiveness 
                including, where available and appropriate, well-
                implemented randomized controlled trials.
                    ``(B) Methodologies to be used.--The evaluation of 
                a demonstration project shall use experimental designs 
                using random assignment or other reliable, evidence-
                based research methodologies that allow for the 
                strongest possible causal inferences when random 
                assignment is not feasible.
                    ``(C) Public disclosure.--The Secretary shall 
                publish the results of the evaluation on the website of 
                the Department of Health and Human Services in a

            ``(6) Recommendations to congress.--The Secretary shall 
        submit recommendations to the Congress on how to increase the 
        employment, retention, and advancement of individuals currently 
        or formerly receiving assistance under a State program funded 
        under this part or any other State program funded with 
        qualified State expenditures (as defined in section 
        409(a)(7)(B)(i)).
            ``(7) Funding.--Of the amounts made available to carry out

        this subsection.
            ``(8) Availability of funds.--Funds provided to a State 
        under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be expended by 
        the State in the fiscal year or in the succeeding fiscal 
        year.''.
