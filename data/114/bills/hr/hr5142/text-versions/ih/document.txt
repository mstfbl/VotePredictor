SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF OPIOID ADDICTION HISTORY IN PATIENT RECORDS.

        including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, to have access 
        to information described in this section when prescribing or 
        dispensing opioid medication to ensure that the medication is 
        medically appropriate given the history of addiction of the 
        patient.
