To enhance public health and safety by improving the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Federal prison system for incarcerated pregnant women 
    and mothers by establishing a pilot program of critical-stage, 
    developmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to 
   inmates, with risk and needs assessments, and risk and recidivism 
                               reduction.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Infant Mortality And Recidivism 
Reduction Act of 2016'' or the ``SIMARRA Act''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.

    Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (hereinafter 
referred to as the ``Director'') shall establish a pilot program 
(hereinafter referred to as the ``Program'') in accordance with this 
Act to permit women incarcerated in Federal prisons and the children 
born to such women during incarceration to reside together while the 
inmate serves a term of imprisonment in a separate housing wing of the 
prison.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of the Act are to--
            (1) prevent infant mortality among infants born to 
        incarcerated mothers and greatly reduce the trauma and stress 
        experienced by the unborn fetuses of pregnant inmates;
            (2) reduce the recidivism rates of federally incarcerated 
        women and mothers, and enhance public safety by improving the 
        effectiveness of the Federal prison system for women as a 
        population with special needs;
            (3) establish female offender risk and needs assessment as 
        the cornerstones of a more effective and efficient Federal 
        prison system;
            (4) implement a validated post-sentencing risk and needs 
        assessment system that relies on dynamic risk factors to 
        provide Federal prison officials with a roadmap to address the 
        pre- and post-natal needs of Federal pregnant offenders, manage 
        limited resources, and enhance public safety;
            (5) perform regular outcome evaluations of the 
        effectiveness of programs and interventions for federally 
        incarcerated pregnant women and mothers to assure that such 
        programs and interventions are evidence-based and to suggest 
        changes, deletions, and expansions based on the results of such 
        evaluations; and
            (6) assist the Department of Justice to address the 
        underlying cost structure of the Federal prison system and 
        ensure that the Department can continue to run prison nurseries 
        safely and securely without compromising the scope or quality 
        of the Department's critical health, safety and law enforcement 
        missions.
