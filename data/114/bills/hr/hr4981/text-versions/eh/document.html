To amend the Controlled Substances Act to improve access to opioid use

Expansion and Modernization Act''.

access to all treatment options for opioid use disorder, overdose 
reversal, and relapse prevention.

SEC. 3. OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT MODERNIZATION.

    (a) In General.--Section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act 
(21 U.S.C. 823(g)(2)) is amended--

        (iii) and inserting the following:
            ``(i) The practitioner is a qualifying practitioner (as 
        defined in subparagraph (G)).
            ``(ii) With respect to patients to whom the practitioner 
        will provide such drugs or combinations of drugs, the 
        practitioner has the capacity to provide directly, by referral, 
        or in such other manner as determined by the Secretary--
                    ``(I) all schedule III, IV, and V drugs, as well as 
                unscheduled medications approved by the Food and Drug 
                Administration, for the treatment of opioid use 
                disorder, including such drugs and medications for 
                maintenance, detoxification, overdose reversal, and 
                relapse prevention, as available; and
                    ``(II) appropriate counseling and other appropriate 
                ancillary services.
            ``(iii)(I) The total number of such patients of the 
        practitioner at any one time will not exceed the applicable 
        number. Except as provided in subclause (II), the applicable 
        number is 30.
            ``(II) The applicable number is 100 if, not sooner than 1 
        year after the date on which the practitioner submitted the 
        initial notification, the practitioner submits a second 
        notification to the Secretary of the need and intent of the 
        practitioner to treat up to 100 patients.
            ``(III) The Secretary may by regulation change such total 
        number.

        patients to whom such drugs or combinations of drugs are 
        directly administered by the qualifying practitioner in the 
        office setting.
            ``(iv) If the Secretary by regulation increases the total 
        number of patients which a qualifying practitioner is permitted 
        to treat pursuant to clause (iii)(II), the Secretary shall 
        require such a practitioner to obtain a written agreement from 
        each patient, including the patient's signature, that the 
        patient--
                    ``(I) will receive an initial assessment and 
                treatment plan and periodic assessments and treatment 
                plans thereafter;

        the requirements for a waiver under this paragraph.'';
                    (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``Upon receiving a 
                notification under subparagraph (B)'' and inserting 
                ``Upon receiving a determination from the Secretary

(G)(iii) of section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 
U.S.C. 823(g)(2)) can treat at any one time pursuant to such section, 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services should consider raising such 
total number to 250 patients following a third notification to the 
Secretary of the need and intent of the physician to treat up to 250 
patients that is submitted to the Secretary not sooner than 1 year 
after the date on which the physician submitted to the Secretary a 
second notification to treat up to 100 patients.
