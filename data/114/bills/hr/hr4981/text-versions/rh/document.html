To amend the Controlled Substances Act to improve access to opioid use 
                          disorder treatment.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Opioid Use Disorder Treatment 
Expansion and Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    The Congress finds that opioid use disorder has become a public 
health epidemic that must be addressed by increasing awareness and 
access to all treatment options for opioid use disorder, overdose 
reversal, and relapse prevention.

SEC. 3. OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT MODERNIZATION.

    (a) In General.--Section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act 
(21 U.S.C. 823(g)(2)) is amended--

        (iii) and inserting the following:
            ``(i) The practitioner is a qualifying practitioner (as 
        defined in subparagraph (G)).
            ``(ii) With respect to patients to whom the practitioner 
        will provide such drugs or combinations of drugs, the 
        practitioner has the capacity to provide directly, by referral, 
        or in such other manner as determined by the Secretary--
                    ``(I) all schedule III, IV, and V drugs, as well as 
                unscheduled medications approved by the Food and Drug 
                Administration, for the treatment of opioid use 
                disorder, including such drugs and medications for 
                maintenance, detoxification, overdose reversal, and 
                relapse prevention, as available; and
                    ``(II) appropriate counseling and other appropriate 
                ancillary services.
            ``(iii)(I) The total number of such patients of the 
        practitioner at any one time will not exceed the applicable 
        number. Except as provided in subclauses (II) and (III), the 
        applicable number is 30.
            ``(II) The applicable number is 100 if, not sooner than 1 
        year after the date on which the practitioner submitted the 
        initial notification, the practitioner submits a second 
        notification to the Secretary of the need and intent of the 
        practitioner to treat up to 100 patients.
            ``(III) The applicable number is 250 if the practitioner is 
        a qualifying physician meeting the requirement of subclause 
        (VI) and, not sooner than 1 year after the date on which the 
        physician submitted a second notification under subclause (II), 
        the practitioner submits a third notification to the Secretary 
        of the need and intent of the physician to treat up to 250 
        patients.
            ``(IV) The Secretary may by regulation change such total 
        number.
            ``(V) The Secretary may exclude from the applicable number 
        patients to whom such drugs or combinations of drugs are 
        directly administered by the qualifying practitioner in the 
        office setting.
            ``(VI) For purposes of subclause (III), a qualifying 
        physician meets the requirement of this subclause if the 
        physician--
                    ``(aa) holds a special certification in addiction 
                psychiatry or addiction medicine as described in clause

        prescribed by the physician for the treatment of opioid use 
        disorder.
            ``(v) In the case of a third notification under clause 
        (iii)(III), the qualifying physician obtains a written

                    ``(IV) understands that receiving regular 
                counseling services is critical to recovery.
            ``(vi) The practitioner will comply with the reporting 
        requirements of subparagraph (D)(i)(IV).'';
