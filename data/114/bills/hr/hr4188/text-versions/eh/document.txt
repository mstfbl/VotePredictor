Subtitle C--Conveyance of Coast Guard Property at Point Spencer, Alaska

SEC. 531. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Major shipping traffic is increasing through the Bering 
        Strait, the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and the Arctic Ocean, and 
        will continue to increase whether or not development of the 
        Outer Continental Shelf of the United States is undertaken in 
        the future, and will increase further if such Outer Continental 
        Shelf development is undertaken.
            (2) There is a compelling national, State, Alaska Native, 
        and private sector need for permanent infrastructure 
        development and for a presence in the Arctic region of Alaska 
        by appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, particularly 
        in proximity to the Bering Strait, to support and facilitate 
        search and rescue, shipping safety, economic development, oil 
        spill prevention and response, protection of Alaska Native 
        archaeological and cultural resources, port of refuge, arctic 
        research, and maritime law enforcement on the Bering Sea, the 
        Chukchi Sea, and the Arctic Ocean.
            (3) The United States owns a parcel of land, known as Point 
        Spencer, located between the Bering Strait and Port Clarence 
        and adjacent to some of the best potential deepwater port sites 
        on the coast of Alaska in the Arctic.
            (4) Prudent and effective use of Point Spencer may be best 
        achieved through marshaling the energy, resources, and 
        leadership of the public and private sectors.
            (5) It is in the national interest to develop 
        infrastructure at Point Spencer that would aid the Coast Guard 
        in performing its statutory duties and functions in the Arctic 
        on a more permanent basis and to allow for public and private 
        sector development of facilities and other infrastructure to 
        support purposes that are of benefit to the United States.

the National Academy of Sciences under which the Academy, by no later 
than 365 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, shall submit 
to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate an assessment of the costs incurred by the 
Federal Government to carry out polar icebreaking missions. The 
assessment shall--
            (1) describe current and emerging requirements for the 
        Coast Guard's polar icebreaking capabilities, taking into 
        account the rapidly changing ice cover in the Arctic 
        environment, national security considerations, and expanding 
        commercial activities in the Arctic and Antarctic, including 
        marine transportation, energy development, fishing, and 
        tourism;
            (2) identify potential design, procurement, leasing, 
        service contracts, crewing, and technology options that could 
        minimize life-cycle costs and optimize efficiency and 
        reliability of Coast Guard polar icebreaker operations in the 
        Arctic and Antarctic; and
            (3) examine--
                    (A) Coast Guard estimates of the procurement and 
                operating costs of a Polar icebreaker capable of 
                carrying out Coast Guard maritime safety, national 
                security, and stewardship responsibilities including--
                            (i) economies of scale that might be 
                        achieved for construction of multiple vessels; 
                        and
                            (ii) costs of renovating existing polar 
                        class icebreakers to operate for a period of no 
                        less than 10 years.
                    (B) the incremental cost to augment the design of 
                such an icebreaker for multiuse capabilities for 
                scientific missions;
                    (C) the potential to offset such incremental cost 
                through cost-sharing agreements with other Federal 
                departments and agencies; and
                    (D) United States polar icebreaking capability in 
                comparison with that of other Arctic nations, and with 
                nations that conduct research in the Arctic.
    (b) Included Costs.--For purposes of subsection (a), the assessment 
shall include costs incurred by the Federal Government for--
            (1) the lease or operation and maintenance of the vessel or 
        vessels concerned;
            (2) disposal of such vessels at the end of the useful life 
        of the vessels;
            (3) retirement and other benefits for Federal employees who 
        operate such vessels; and
            (4) interest payments assumed to be incurred for Federal 
        capital expenditures.
    (c) Assumptions.--For purposes of comparing the costs of such 
alternatives, the Academy shall assume that--
            (1) each vessel under consideration is--
                    (A) capable of breaking out McMurdo Station and 
                conducting Coast Guard missions in the Antarctic, and 
                in the United States territory in the Arctic (as that 
                term is defined in section 112 of the Arctic Research 
                and Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111)); and
                    (B) operated for a period of 30 years;
            (2) the acquisition of services and the operation of each 
        vessel begins on the same date; and
            (3) the periods for conducting Coast Guard missions in the 
        Arctic are of equal lengths.
    (d) Use of Information.--In formulating cost pursuant to subsection 
(a), the National Academy of Sciences may utilize information from 
other Coast Guard reports, assessments, or analyses regarding existing 
Coast Guard Polar class icebreakers or for the acquisition of a polar 
icebreaker for the Federal Government.
