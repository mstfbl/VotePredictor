    TITLE I--IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND CLARITY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

SEC. 101. PLAIN LANGUAGE REWRITE OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL BUSINESS 
              PROCUREMENTS.

    Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) Small Business Procurements.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this Act, small business 
        concerns shall receive any award or contract if such award or 
        contract is, in the determination of the Administrator and the 
        contracting agency, in the interest of--
                    ``(A) maintaining or mobilizing the full productive 
                capacity of the United States;
                    ``(B) war or national defense programs; or
                    ``(C) assuring that a fair proportion of the total 
                purchase and contracts for goods and services of the 
                Government in each industry category (as described 
                under paragraph (2)) are awarded to small business 
                concerns.
            ``(2) Industry category defined.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In this subsection, the term 
                `industry category' means a discrete group of similar 
                goods and services, as determined by the Administrator 
                in accordance with the North American Industry 
                Classification System codes used to establish small 
                business size standards, except that the Administrator 
                shall limit an industry category to a greater extent 
                than provided under the North American Industry 
                Classification codes if the Administrator receives 
                evidence indicating that further segmentation of the 
                industry category is warranted--
                            ``(i) due to special capital equipment 
                        needs;
                            ``(ii) due to special labor requirements;
                            ``(iii) due to special geographic 
                        requirements, except as provided in 
                        subparagraph (B);
                            ``(iv) due to unique Federal buying 
                        patterns or requirements; or
                            ``(v) to recognize a new industry.
                    ``(B) Exception for geographic requirements.--The 
                Administrator may not further segment an industry 
                category based on geographic requirements unless--
                            ``(i) the Government typically designates 
                        the geographic area where work for contracts 
                        for goods or services is to be performed;
                            ``(ii) Government purchases comprise the 
                        major portion of the entire domestic market for 
                        such goods or services; and
                            ``(iii) it is unreasonable to expect 
                        competition from business concerns located 
                        outside of the general geographic area due to 
                        the fixed location of facilities, high 
                        mobilization costs, or similar economic 
                        factors.
            ``(3) Determinations with respect to awards or contracts.--
        Determinations made pursuant to paragraph (1) may be made for 
        individual awards or contracts, any part of an award or 
        contract or task order, or for classes of awards or contracts 
        or task orders.
            ``(4) Increasing prime contracting opportunities for small 
        business concerns.--
                    ``(A) Description of covered proposed 
                procurements.--The requirements of this paragraph shall 
                apply to a proposed procurement that includes in its 
                statement of work goods or services currently being 
                supplied or performed by a small business concern and, 
                as determined by the Administrator--
                            ``(i) is in a quantity or of an estimated 
                        dollar value which makes the participation of a 
                        small business concern as a prime contractor 
                        unlikely;
                            ``(ii) in the case of a proposed 
                        procurement for construction, if such proposed 
                        procurement seeks to bundle or consolidate 
                        discrete construction projects; or
                            ``(iii) is a solicitation that involves an 
                        unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract 
                        requirements.
                    ``(B) Notice to procurement center 
                representatives.--With respect to proposed procurements 
                described in subparagraph (A), at least 30 days before 
                issuing a solicitation and concurrent with other 
                processing steps required before issuing the 
                solicitation, the contracting agency shall provide a 
                copy of the proposed procurement to the procurement 
                center representative of the contracting agency (as 
                described in subsection (l)) along with a statement 
                explaining--
                            ``(i) why the proposed procurement cannot 
                        be divided into reasonably small lots (not less 
                        than economic production runs) to permit offers 
                        on quantities less than the total requirement;
                            ``(ii) why delivery schedules cannot be 
                        established on a realistic basis that will 
                        encourage the participation of small business 
                        concerns in a manner consistent with the actual 
                        requirements of the Government;
                            ``(iii) why the proposed procurement cannot 
                        be offered to increase the likelihood of the 
                        participation of small business concerns;
                            ``(iv) in the case of a proposed 
                        procurement for construction, why the proposed 
                        procurement cannot be offered as separate 
                        discrete projects; or
                            ``(v) why the agency has determined that 
                        the bundling of contract requirements is 
                        necessary and justified.
                    ``(C) Alternatives to increase prime contracting 
                opportunities for small business concerns.--If the 
                procurement center representative believes that the 
                proposed procurement will make the participation of 
                small business concerns as prime contractors unlikely, 
                the procurement center representative, within 15 days 
                after receiving the statement described in subparagraph 
                (B), shall recommend to the contracting agency 
                alternative procurement methods for increasing prime 
                contracting opportunities for small business concerns.
                    ``(D) Failure to agree on an alternative 
                procurement method.--If the procurement center 
                representative and the contracting agency fail to agree 
                on an alternative procurement method, the Administrator 
                shall submit the matter to the head of the appropriate 
                department or agency for a determination.
            ``(5) Contracts for sale of government property.--With 
        respect to a contract for the sale of Government property, 
        small business concerns shall receive any such contract if, in 
        the determination of the Administrator and the disposal agency, 
        the award of such contract is in the interest of assuring that 
        a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be 
        made to small business concerns.
            ``(6) Sale of electrical power or other propery.--Nothing 
        in this subsection shall be construed to change any preferences 
        or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of 
        electrical power or other property by the Federal Government.
            ``(7) Costs exceeding fair market price.--A contract may 
        not be awarded under this subsection if the cost of the 
        contract to the awarding agency exceeds a fair market price.''.
