SEC. 2. REQUIRING TEXT OF LEGISLATION TO BE AVAILABLE PRIOR TO 
              CONSIDERATION IN HOUSE OR SENATE.

    (a) Requiring Availability of Text.--It shall not be in order to 
consider any bill or resolution in the House of Representatives 
(including the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union) 
or Senate unless the text of the bill or resolution to be considered, 
including text made in order in the House (or the Committee of the 
Whole) as a result of the adoption by the House of a resolution 
providing for consideration of the bill or resolution, is published on 
an official website of the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the 
Senate (as the case may be) not fewer than the applicable minimum 
number of hours prior to the consideration of the bill or resolution.
    (b) Applicable Minimum Number of Hours.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the 
        ``applicable minimum number of hours'' with respect to the text 
        of a bill or resolution is--
                    (A) in the case of text of 300 or fewer pages, 72 
                hours; or
                    (B) in the case of text of more than 300 pages, the 
                sum of 72 hours plus 24 hours for each additional 
                increment of text of 100 or fewer pages.
            (2) Excluding hours during which house or senate is not in 
        session.--In determining the applicable number of hours under 
        paragraph (1), there shall be excluded any hour during which 
        the House of Representatives is not in session (in the case of 
        a bill or resolution in the House) or any hour during which the 
        Senate is not in session (in the case of a bill or resolution 
        in the Senate).
    (c) No Waiver or Modification.--Neither House of Congress, nor 
Congress jointly, by concurrent resolution, unanimous consent, or any 
other order, resolution, vote, or other means, may dispense with, or 
otherwise waive or modify, the requirements set forth in this section.

SEC. 3. RULES FOR SHOWING AMENDMENTS MADE TO EXISTING LAW BY BILLS OR 
              JOINT RESOLUTIONS.

    (a) Material To Be Included in Committee Reports.--Whenever a 
committee of the House of Representatives or Senate reports a bill or 
joint resolution proposing to repeal or amend a statute or part 
thereof, it shall include in its report or in an accompanying 
document--
            (1) the entire text of each section of a statute that is 
        proposed to be repealed or amended; and
            (2) a comparative print of each amendment to a section of a 
        statute that the bill or joint resolution proposes to make, 
        showing by appropriate typographical devices the omissions and 
        insertions proposed.
    (b) Requirements for Comparative Print.--If a committee of the 
House of Representatives or Senate reports a bill or joint resolution 
proposing to repeal or amend a statute or part thereof with a 
recommendation that the bill or joint resolution be amended, the 
comparative print required by subsection (a) shall reflect the changes 
in existing law proposed to be made by the bill or joint resolution as 
proposed to be amended.
    (c) Prohibiting Consideration of Reported Bills or Joint 
Resolutions Failing To Meet Requirements.--It shall not be in order to 
consider any bill or joint resolution in the House of Representatives 
(including the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union) 
or Senate which is reported by a committee if the committee does not 
meet the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) with respect to the bill 
or joint resolution.
    (d) No Waiver or Modification.--Neither House of Congress, nor 
Congress jointly, by concurrent resolution, unanimous consent, or any 
other order, resolution, vote, or other means, may dispense with, or 
otherwise waive or modify, the requirements set forth in this section.

effect, and no legal, equitable, regulatory, civil, or criminal action 
may be brought under such an Act of Congress.

a cause of action under sections 2201 and 2202 of title 28, United 
States Code, against the United States seeking appropriate relief 
(including an injunction against enforcement of any Act of Congress the 
consideration of which was in violation of the applicable requirements 
of section 2 or 3) may be brought by--
            (1) a person aggrieved by an action of an officer or 
        employee in the executive branch of the Federal Government 
        under such an Act of Congress; and
            (2) a Member of Congress aggrieved by the consideration of
