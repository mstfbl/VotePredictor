 To release a Wilderness Study Area administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management in Jackson County, Colorado, that was not found suitable for 
 wilderness designation, and to release residual Wilderness Study Area 
 acreage in Mesa and Delta Counties, Colorado, that were excluded from 
their respective wilderness designations from continued management for 
                      wilderness characteristics.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Western Colorado Wilderness Study 
Area Release Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) Congress finds that for the purposes of section 603(c) 
        of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 
        U.S.C. 1782(c)), the public lands in the North Sand Hills 
        Instant Study Area in Jackson County, Colorado, have been 
        adequately studied for wilderness designation; and
                    (A) the Bureau of Land Management in 1980 found the 
                North Sand Hills Instant Study Area did not meet 
                wilderness criteria; and
                    (B) in 2011, the Bureau of Land Management Colorado 
                Northwest Resource Advisory Council Resolution 2011-01 
                supported the release of the North Sand Hills Instant 
                Study Area from further consideration of wilderness 
                designation.
            (2) Congress finds that for the purposes of section 603(c) 
        of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 
        U.S.C. 1782(c)), the public lands, as defined by section 103(e) 
        of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 
        U.S.C. 1702(e)), in the Dominguez Canyon Wilderness Study Area 
        in Mesa and Delta Counties, Colorado, and the public lands, as 
        defined by section 103(e) of the Federal Land Policy and 
        Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702(e)), in the Black Ridge 
        Canyons Wilderness Study Area in Mesa County, Colorado, have 
        been adequately studied for wilderness designation and the 
        remaining Wilderness Study Area acreage in the Dominguez Canyon 
        Wilderness Study Area and the Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness 
        Study Area was excluded from their respective wilderness 
        designations.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to release certain 
Wilderness Study Areas from further consideration of wilderness 
designation, and to direct the Secretary of the Interior to manage 
those areas according to applicable land use plans.
