Bureau of Land Management in the Salem District, Eugene District, 
Roseburg District, Coos Bay District, Medford District, and the Klamath 
Resource Area of the Lakeview District in the State of Oregon shall 
hereafter be managed pursuant to title I of the of the Act of August

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 809. BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT 
              PLANS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Additional Analysis and Alternatives.--To develop a 
full range of reasonable alternatives as required by the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Secretary of the Interior shall 
develop and consider in detail a reference analysis and two additional 
alternatives as part of the revisions of the resource management plans 
for the Bureau of Land Management's Salem, Eugene, Coos Bay, Roseburg, 
and Medford Districts and the Klamath Resource Area of the Lakeview 
District.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Reference Analysis.--The reference analysis required 
by subsection (a) shall measure and assume the harvest of the annual 
growth net of natural mortality for all forested land in the planning 
area in order to determine the maximum sustained yield capacity of the 
forested land base and to establish a baseline by which the Secretary 
of the Interior shall measure incremental effects on the sustained 
yield capacity and environmental impacts from management prescriptions 
in all other alternatives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Additional Alternatives.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Carbon sequestration alternative.--The 
        Secretary of the Interior shall develop and consider an 
        additional alternative with the goal of maximizing the total 
        carbon benefits from forest storage and wood product storage. 
        To the extent practicable, the analysis shall consider--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the future risks to forest carbon from 
                wildfires, insects, and disease;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the amount of carbon stored in 
                products or in landfills;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the life cycle benefits of harvested 
                wood products compared to non-renewable products; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) the energy produced from wood 
                residues.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Sustained yield alternative.--The Secretary of 
        the Interior shall develop and consider an additional 
        alternative that produces the greater of 500 million board feet 
        or the annual net growth on the acres classified as timberland, 
        excluding any congressionally reserved areas. The projected 
        harvest levels, as nearly as practicable, shall be distributed 
        among the Districts referred to in subsection (a) in the same 
        proportion as the maximum yield capacity of each such District 
        bears to maximum yield capacity of the planning area as a 
        whole.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Additional Analysis and Public Participation.--The 
Secretary of the Interior shall publish the reference analysis and 
additional alternatives and analyze their environmental and economic 
consequences in a supplemental draft environmental impact statement. 
The draft environmental impact statement and supplemental draft 
environmental impact statement shall be made available for public 
comment for a period of not less than 180 days. The Secretary shall 
respond to any comments received before making a final decision between 
all alternatives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
affect the obligation of the Secretary of the Interior to manage the 
timberlands as required by the Act of August 28, 1937 (50 Stat. 874; 43 
U.S.C. 1181a-1181j).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

at least one landscape-scale forest restoration project that includes, 
as a defined purpose of the project, the generation of material that 
will be used to promote advanced wood products. The project shall be 
developed through a collaborative process.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 201. ANALYSIS OF ONLY 2 ALTERNATIVES IN PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE 
              FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

    (a) In General.--This section shall apply whenever the Secretary 
concerned prepares an environmental assessment or an environmental 
impact statement pursuant to section 102(2) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)) for a forest 
management activity--
            (1) that is--
                    (A) developed through a collaborative process; or
                    (B) covered by a community wildfire protection 
                plan; and

                    (A) the reduction of hazardous fuels;
                    (B) the reduction of fuel connectivity through the 
                installation of fuel and fire breaks;
                    (C) the restoration of forest health and 
                resilience;
