    (a) Findings.--Section 2(a) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``The freedom of 
        thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect 
        theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess 
        or practice any religion.'' before ``Governments'';
            (2) in paragraph (4), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``A policy or practice of routinely denying applications for 
        visas for religious workers in a country can be indicative of a 
        poor state of religious freedom in that country.''; and
            (3) in paragraph (6)--
                    (A) by inserting ``and the specific targeting of 
                non-theists, humanists, and atheists because of their 
                beliefs'' after ``religious persecution''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``and in regions where non-state 
                actors exercise significant political power and 
                territorial control'' before the period at the end.
    (b) Policy.--Section 2(b) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401(b)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as 
        subparagraphs (A) through (E);
            (2) by striking the matter preceding subparagraph (A), as 
        redesignated, and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In general.--The following shall be the policy of the 
        United States:''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Evolving policies and coordinated diplomatic 
        responses.--Because the promotion of international religious 
        freedom protects human rights, advances democracy abroad, and 
        advances United States interests in stability, security, and 
        development globally, the promotion of international religious 
        freedom requires new and evolving policies and diplomatic 
        responses that--
                    ``(A) are drawn from the expertise of the national 
                security agencies, the diplomatic services, and other 
                governmental agencies and nongovernmental 
                organizations; and
                    ``(B) are coordinated across and carried out by the 
                entire range of Federal agencies.''.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a policy or practice by the government of any foreign 
        country of routinely denying visa applications for religious 
        workers can be indicative of a poor state of religious freedom 
        in that country; and
            (2) the United States Government should seek to reverse any 
        such policy by reviewing the entirety of the bilateral 
        relationship between such country and the United States.

                        religion, or any religion;''; and

                        including descriptions of the targeted 
                        religious group, the content, communication, or 
                        activities censored, and the means used; and'';

                    (B) by inserting ``policies that ban or restrict 
                the public manifestation of religious belief and the 
                peaceful involvement of religious groups or their 
                members in the political life of each such foreign 
                country,'' after ``such groups,'';

        United States actions and'' and inserting ``A detailed 
        description of United States actions, diplomatic and political 
        coordination efforts, and other''; and

                Religious Freedom Act is located shall be included in 
                this section of the report.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the original intent of the International Religious 
        Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to require 
        annual reports from both the Department of State and the 
        Commission on International Religious Freedom to be delivered 
        each year, during the same calendar year, and with at least 5 
        months separating these reports, in order to provide updated 
        information for policymakers, Members of Congress, and 
        nongovernmental organizations; and
            (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights 
        Practices no longer contain updated information on religious 
        freedom conditions globally, it is important that the 
        Department of State coordinate with the Commission to fulfill 
        the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act 
        of 1998.

SEC. 103. TRAINING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICERS.

                how violations of international religious freedom harm 
                fundamental United States interests, how the 
                advancement of international religious freedom can 
                advance such interests, how United States international

                defense, diplomacy, development, and public affairs

                availability of sufficient resources to develop and 
                implement such curriculum.

                    TITLE III--PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS

SEC. 301. NON-STATE ACTOR DESIGNATIONS.

    (a) In General.--The President, concurrent with the annual foreign 
country review required under section 402(b)(1)(A) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)), shall--
            (1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in 
        any such reviewed country or surrounding region that have 
        engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; 
        and
            (2) designate, in a manner consistent with such Act, each 
        such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for 
        religious freedom.
    (b) Report.--Whenever the President designates a non-state actor 
under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for religious 
freedom, the President, as soon as practicable after the designation is 
made, shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees 
that describes the reasons for such designation.
    (c) Actions.--The President should take specific actions, when 
practicable, to address severe violations of religious freedom of non-
state actors that are designated under subsection (a)(2).
    (d) Department of State Annual Report.--The Secretary of State 
should include information detailing the reasons the President 
designated a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for 
religious freedom under subsection (a) in the Annual Report required 
under section 102(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 
1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)).
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of State should work with Congress and 
        the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom--
                    (A) to create new political, financial, and 
                diplomatic tools to address severe violations of 
                religious freedom by non-state actors; and
                    (B) to update the actions the President can take 
                under section 405 of the International Religious 
                Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445);
            (2) governments must ultimately be held accountable for the 
        abuses that occur in their territories; and
            (3) any actions the President takes after designating a 
        non-state actor as an entity of particular concern should also 
        involve high-level diplomacy with the government of the country 
        in which the non-state actor is operating.
    (f) Determinations of Responsible Parties.--In order to 
appropriately target Presidential actions under the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), the President, 
with respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of 
particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), shall 
seek to determine, to the extent practicable, the specific officials or 
members that are responsible for the particularly severe violations of 
religious freedom engaged in or tolerated by such non-state actor.
    (g) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``appropriate 
congressional committees'', ``non-state actor'', and ``particularly 
severe violations of religious freedom'' have the meanings given such 
terms in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6402), as amended by section 3 of this Act.

                TITLE IV--PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

SEC. 401. ASSISTANCE FOR PROMOTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

    (a) Availability of Assistance.--It is the sense of Congress that 
for each fiscal year that begins on or after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the President should request sufficient appropriations 
from Congress to support--
            (1) the vigorous promotion of international religious 
        freedom and for projects to advance United States interests in 
        the protection and advancement of international religious 
        freedom, in particular, through grants to groups that--
                    (A) are capable of developing legal protections or 
                promoting cultural and societal understanding of 
                international norms of religious freedom;
                    (B) seek to address and mitigate religiously 
                motivated and sectarian violence and combat violent 
                extremism; or
                    (C) seek to strengthen investigations, reporting, 
                and monitoring of religious freedom violations, 
                including genocide perpetrated against religious 
                minorities; and
            (2) the establishment of an effective Religious Freedom 
        Defense Fund, to be administered by the Ambassador at Large for 
        International Religious Freedom, to provide grants for--
                    (A) victims of religious freedom abuses and their 
                families to cover legal and other expenses that may 
                arise from detention, imprisonment, torture, fines, and 
                other restrictions; and
                    (B) projects to help create and support training of 
                a new generation of defenders of religious freedom, 
                including legal and political advocates, and civil 
                society projects which seek to create advocacy 
                networks, strengthen legal representation, train and 
                educate new religious freedom defenders, and build the 
                capacity of religious communities and rights defenders 
                to protect against religious freedom violations, 
                mitigate societal or sectarian violence, or minimize 
                legal or other restrictions of the right to freedom of 
                religion.
    (b) Preference.--It is the sense of Congress that, in providing 
grants under subsection (a), the Ambassador at Large for International 
Religious Freedom should, as appropriate, give preference to projects 
targeting religious freedom violations in countries--
            (1) designated as countries of particular concern for 
        religious freedom under section 402(b)(1) of the International 
        Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)); or
            (2) included on the Special Watch List described in section 
        402(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 
        1998, as added by section 302(1)(A)(i) of this Act.
    (c) Administration and Consultations.--
            (1) Administration.--Amounts made available under 
        subsection (a) shall be administered by the Ambassador at Large 
        for International Religious Freedom.
            (2) Consultations.--In developing priorities and policies 
        for providing grants authorized under subsection (a), including

        religion peacefully as protected in international law;

        of religion in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, the 
        status of a worker's or faculty member's employment or a 
        student's enrollment; and
            ``(3) make every effort in all negotiations, contracts, or

        foreign policy and national security priority; and

        freedom of religion is a strategy that--
                    ``(A) protects other, related human rights, and 
                advances democracy outside the United States; and
                    ``(B) makes clear its importance to United States 
                foreign policy goals of stability, security, 
                development, and diplomacy;
            ``(3) should be a guide for the strategies and activities 
        of relevant Federal agencies; and

        defense review under section 118 of title 10, United States 
        Code, and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and
