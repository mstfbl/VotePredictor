    ``(i) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`termination bill' means only a bill of either House of Congress that 
is introduced under subsection (h) with respect to a free trade 
agreement, or a section, chapter, or other portion of such trade 
agreement, with respect to which a determination by the Comptroller 
General of export disruption, labor disruption, or trade balance 
disruption has been received under subsection (g)(1) and that 
contains--
            ``(1) a provision terminating, within 6 months after the 
        date of the enactment of the bill, such free trade agreement, 
        or section, chapter, or other portion of such trade agreement, 
        with respect to specific goods or industries, to the extent 
        that the determination of the Comptroller General applies only 
        to such goods or industries; and
            ``(2) if changes in existing laws or new statutory 
        authorities are required to cancel such free trade agreement or 
        section, chapter, or other portion of such trade agreement, and 
        with respect to such goods or industries, provisions necessary 
        or appropriate to terminate such free trade agreement or 
        section, chapter, or other portion of such trade agreement, by 
        repealing or amending existing laws or providing new statutory 
        authority.
    ``(j) Future Negotiations.--If a termination bill with respect to a 
free trade agreement, or a section, chapter, or other portion of such 
trade agreement, is enacted into law, then trade authorities 
procedures, or any other form of expedited consideration by either 
House of Congress, shall not apply to a free trade agreement, or 
section, chapter, or other portion of such trade agreement, that is 
renegotiated in substantially the same form as the free trade 
agreement, or section, chapter, or other portion of such trade 
agreement, that led to the determination of export disruption, labor 
disruption, or trade balance disruption under subsection (g)(1) with 
respect to which the termination bill was enacted.''.
