                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Office of the Special Inspector General for Monitoring 
            the Affordable Care Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Special Inspector General for 
Monitoring the ACA Act of 2015'' or the ``SIGMA Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The writing, passage, and implementation of the 
        Affordable Care Act has utterly lacked transparency.
            (2) Presidential candidate Barack Obama repeatedly promised 
        that if elected President, he would hold open, public 
        negotiations on health care reform among public and private 
        stakeholders, including at a Democratic Presidential debate on 
        January 31, 2008, when he said, ``That's what I will do in 
        bringing all parties together, not negotiating behind closed 
        doors, but bringing all parties together, and broadcasting 
        those negotiations on C-SPAN so that the American people can 
        see what the choices are, because part of what we have to do is 
        enlist the American people in this process.''.
            (3) Then-Senator Obama repeated this promise multiple 
        times, including at an Ohio town hall on March 1, 2008, when he 
        said, ``But here's the thing: we're gonna do all these 
        negotiations on C-SPAN. So the American people will be able to 
        watch these negotiations.''.
            (4) Then-Senator Obama also repeated this promise at a 
        Virginia town hall on August 21, 2008, when he said, ``I'm 
        going to have all the negotiations around a big table. We'll 
        have doctors and nurses and hospital administrators. Insurance 
        companies, drug companies--they'll get a seat at the table . . 
        . But what we will do is, we'll have the negotiations televised 
        on C-SPAN, so that people can see who is making arguments on 
        behalf of their constituents, and who are making arguments on 
        behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies. And 
        so, that approach, I think is what is going to allow people to 
        stay involved in this process.''.
            (5) In a September 26, 2011, interview, Brian Lamb, the CEO 
        of C-SPAN confirmed the negotiations of the health reform law 
        had not been broadcast publicly, noting, ``The President said 
        that they were all going to be on C-SPAN. He never asked us.''.
            (6) President Obama, in leading the national health reform 
        debate, broke his promise, admitting in a January 25, 2010, 
        interview with ABC News that locking the public out of key 
        health reform discussions was a ``mistake'' and explaining, 
        ``We had to make so many decisions quickly in a very difficult 
        set of circumstances that after awhile, we started worrying 
        more about getting the policy right than getting the process 
        right. But I had campaigned on process--part of what I had 
        campaigned on was changing how Washington works, opening up, 
        transparency and I think it is--I think the health care debate 
        as it unfolded legitimately raised concerns not just among my 
        opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know 
        what's going on. And it's an ugly process and it looks like 
        there are a bunch of backroom deals.''.
            (7) On March 9, 2010, then-Speaker of the House Nancy 
        Pelosi said of what would become the Affordable Care Act, ``We 
        have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in 
        it.''.
            (8) Dr. Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the 
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was awarded a contract 
        by the Department of Health and Human Services to provide 
        ``technical assistance in evaluating options for national 
        healthcare reform'' due to his ``proprietary statistically 
        sophisticated micro-simulation model'' which could assess the 
        impact of changes in Federal health care policies.
            (9) Dr. Gruber described himself as a health reform 
        architect who contributed to the crafting of the Affordable 
        Care Act in a 2012 opinion editorial, noting, ``Several of the 
        architects of Massachusetts reform, including myself, worked 
        closely with the Administration and Congress to translate the 
        lessons from Massachusetts onto the national stage.''.
            (10) Dr. Gruber's MIT biography has described him as ``a 
        key architect'' of the Massachusetts health reform effort and a 
        2009 and 2010 ``technical consultant'' who ``worked with both 
        the Administration and Congress to help craft the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act.''.
            (11) An October 11, 2011, report by NBC News described 
        White House visitor logs that show Dr. Gruber had at least five 
        meetings at the White House in 2009 in the lead up to the 
        passage of the Affordable Care Act, including a meeting in the 
        Oval Office with President Obama to evaluate options for 
        national health reform.
            (12) In a video posted April 12, 2012, by the Obama 
        presidential campaign to YouTube, Dr. Gruber states that he 
        went ``down to Washington to help President Obama develop his 
        national version of that law.''.
            (13) A March 28, 2012, article in the New York Times 
        reports that ``After Mr. Gruber helped the administration put 
        together the basic principles of the proposal, the White House 
        lent him to Capitol Hill to help congressional staff members 
        draft the specifics of the legislation.''.
            (14) In a January 18, 2012, lecture on the structure of the 
        Affordable Care Act, Dr. Gruber refers to the law's small 
        business tax credits as a portion of the bill that he 
        ``actually wrote.''.
            (15) Dr. Gruber's initial contract with the Department of 
        Health and Human Services (HHS) was for $297,000, and later a 
        Federal grant of $95,000 brought his total Federal compensation 
        for work on the Affordable Care Act to at least $392,000.
            (16) In 2009, the White House annual report to Congress on 
        Presidential staff salaries lists that twenty-two White House 
        staffers made the highest Presidential staff salary rate of 
        $172,200, including the White House Chief of Staff, senior 
        advisers, White House Counsel, and National Security Adviser.
            (17) In 2010, the White House annual report to Congress on 
        Presidential staff salaries lists that twenty-three White House 
        staffers made the highest Presidential staff salary rate of 
        $172,200, again including the President's top management, 
        policy, communications, and security advisers.
            (18) In 2009 and 2010, each of President Obama's most 
        senior White House staff received less compensation than Dr. 
        Gruber.
            (19) In a November 5, 2012, speech at the University of 
        Rhode Island, Dr. Gruber described the mechanism of the 
        Affordable Care Act, stating, ``It's a very clever, you know, 
        basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the 
        American voter.''.
            (20) At an October 17, 2013, panel at the University of 
        Pennsylvania, Dr. Gruber described the Affordable Care Act, 
        stating, ``This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure 
        CBO did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the 
        mandate as taxes, the bill dies. Okay, so it's written to do 
        that.''.
            (21) In the same speech, Dr. Gruber stated that, ``if you 
        had a law which said that healthy people are going to pay in 
        you made explicit healthy people pay in and sick people get 
        money, it would not have passed.''.
            (22) Dr. Gruber went on to claim, ``Lack of transparency is 
        a huge political advantage. And basically, call it the 
        stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that 
        was really, really critical for the thing to pass.''.
            (23) Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 
        President Obama called for a new, more transparent approach to 
        the health reform law moving forward, saying in a January 25, 
        2010, ABC News interview, ``The process didn't run the way I 
        ideally would like it to and that we have to move forward in a 
        way that recaptures that sense of opening things up more.''.
            (24) The Obama Administration's implementation of the 
        Affordable Care Act has been marked by Executive overreach.
            (25) On at least 28 occasions, President Obama and his 
        administration have unilaterally delayed, extended, or changed 
        provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including in 
        contravention of the law and the Constitution of the United 
        States.
            (26) Section 1513 of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act (26 U.S.C. 4980h note) requires applicable large 
        employers with more than 50 full-time employees to provide 
        qualifying health insurance to their employees or pay a fine, 
        and the effective date under such section specified the 
        amendments made by such section applied to months beginning 
        after December 31, 2013.
            (27) Contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory 
        requirement, and acting without authority provided by law, the 
        Internal Revenue Service published in the Federal Register 
        Notice 2013-45 to change the effective date of the employer 
        mandate requirement, stating, ``Section 1513(d) of the 
        Affordable Care Act provides that section 4980H applies to 
        months after December 31, 2013; however Notice 2013-45, issued 
        on July 9, 2013, provides as transition relief that no 
        assessable payments under section 4980H will apply for 2014.''.
            (28) On July 12, 2013, the Director for the Center for 
        Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at the Centers for 
        Medicare & Medicaid Services denied the request for exemption 
        from certain Affordable Care Act requirements made by 
        representatives of the United States territories, writing to 
        the Secretary of Commerce for the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, ``However meritorious your request might be, 
        [the Department of Health and Human Services] is not authorized 
        to choose which provisions [of the Affordable Care Act] . . . 
        might apply to the territories.''.
            (29) A year later, on July 16, 2014, the Administrator of 
        the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services notified 
        representatives of the United States territories that they 
        would in fact receive an exemption from requirements under the 
        Affordable Care Act, despite the previous explanation from CMS 
        that CMS does not have the legal authority to provide such an 
        exemption. As the CMS Administrator now rationalized, 
        ``Currently, the Department uses the existing Public Health 
        Service Act (PHS Act) definition of `State' for new PHS Act 
        requirements and funding opportunities included in title I of 
        the Affordable Care Act. Under this definition, the new market 
        reforms in the PHS Act apply to the territories. We have been 
        informed by representatives of the territories that this 
        interpretation is undermining the stability of the territories' 
        health insurance markets. After a careful review of this 
        situation and the relevant statutory language, HHS has 
        determined that the new provisions of the PHS Act enacted in 
        title I are appropriately governed by the definition of `State' 
        set forth in that title, and therefore that these new 
        provisions do not apply to the territories.''.
            (30) The Obama Administration has claimed that the 
        Affordable Care Act will save money and improve the economy, 
        with WhiteHouse.gov stating, ``In keeping with the President's 
        pledge that reform must fix our health care system without 
        adding to the deficit, the Affordable Care Act reduces the 
        deficit, saving over $200 billion over 10 years and more than 
        $1 trillion in the second decade. The law reduces health care 
        costs . . . [and] is improving our economic 
        competitiveness[.]''.
            (31) $70.2 billion of the White House's estimated savings 
        was to come from the Community Living Assistance Services and 
        Supports (CLASS) Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a 
        program that was deemed actuarially unsound and never 
        implemented by the Obama Administration.
            (32) An April 2010 report from the Office of the Actuary 
        for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services describes that 
        additional savings under the Affordable Care Act were to be 
        paid for with Medicare Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage 
        cuts and reductions in payments to hospitals, skilled nursing 
        facilities, and home health centers. These cuts have been 
        delayed and may never materialize. Even if implemented, the 
        projected savings may never accrue as the CMS Actuary's report 
        concludes that such cuts will cause about 15 percent of 
        hospitals and post-acute care facilities like nursing homes to 
        go out of business.
            (33) $52 billion in deficit reduction savings was projected 
        to come from employer penalties paid to the Government for 
        failure to comply with the employer mandate requirement to 
        provide employees health insurance, a requirement that the 
        Obama Administration has repeatedly delayed and modified, 
        causing penalties and associated savings to not accrue.
            (34) Initial estimates of savings under the Affordable Care 
        Act projected at least $15.5 billion in savings over the next 
        decade attributable to Medicare cuts through the Independent 
        Payment Advisory Board, which has not yet been appointed and 
        through which no cuts or savings have been realized.
            (35) On September 9, 2009, President Obama pledged to a 
        joint session of Congress, ``I will not sign a [health care 
        reform] plan that adds one dime to our deficits--either now or 
        in the future.''.
            (36) The Congressional Budget Office estimated in February 
        2014 that health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care 
        Act would cost the Federal Government $47 billion in fiscal 
        year 2015 and $1.197 trillion over fiscal years 2015-2024.
            (37) The Committees on Finance and Health, Education, 
        Labor, and Pensions of the Senate estimated in September 2014 
        that the Affordable Care Act will add at least $340 billion to 
        Federal budget deficits.
            (38) Dr. Gruber stated, ``The [Affordable Care Act] isn't 
        designed to save money.''.
            (39) On at least 37 occasions, President Obama or a top 
        official in the executive branch repeated the promise that ``If 
        you like the [health insurance] plan you have, you can keep it. 
        If you like the doctor you have, you can keep your doctor.''.
            (40) The Associated Press calculated at least 4.7 million 
        Americans had their health insurance cancelled for 2014 and 
        later, when the President issued a last-minute fix to try to 
        prevent these cancellations as required by the Affordable Care 
        Act, the changes came too late for approximately 2.4 million 
        Americans to keep the plans they had and liked.
            (41) The nonpartisan, fact-checking publication Politifact 
        rated ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.'' 
        as the Lie of the Year for 2013.
            (42) Then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama repeatedly 
        promised that, if elected President, his national health care 
        reforms would, ``cut the cost of a typical family's premium by 
        up to $2,500 a year.''.
            (43) A November 2013 analysis by the Manhattan Institute 
        calculates that the Affordable Care Act would increase 
        individual marketplace health insurance premiums by 41 percent 
        nationwide between 2013 and 2014.
            (44) A December 2013 study by Health Pocket, Inc., found 
        that the average individual deductible for a Bronze plan was 
        $5,081 a year, a 42-percent increase from the average plan 
        purchased by an individual in 2013.
            (45) A February 2013 study by Health Pocket Inc., found 
        that exchange plans under the Affordable Care Act averaged a 
        34-percent increase in drug-cost sharing compared to copayment 
        and coinsurance rates in the pre-Affordable Care Act market. 
        For the sickest patients needing specialty drugs, the study 
        found copayments increased by 226 percent under a Bronze plan 
        via the Affordable Care Act.
            (46) A December 2013 study by McKinsey and Company found 
        that insurers offered almost three times as many narrow or 
        ultranarrow network plans in 2014 compared to 2013. Fully 70 
        percent of Affordable Care Act plans analyzed had narrow or 
        ultranarrow network coverage, meaning coverage for fewer 
        doctors and hospitals than plans sold on the individual market 
        before the law took effect.
            (47) Details consumers require to make informed decisions 
        about their health care plan coverage under the Affordable Care 
        Act have been withheld or lacked transparency.
            (48) On September 26, 2013, President Obama said, ``It will 
        say clearly what each plan covers, what each plan costs. The 
        price will be right there. It will be fully transparent . . . 
        And so if you've ever tried to buy insurance on your own, I 
        promise you this is a lot easier. It's like booking a hotel or 
        a plane ticket.''.
            (49) HealthCare.gov was established as the website to 
        implement the Federal exchange portion of the Act at a cost of 
        as much as $840 million, including more than $150 million in 
        cost overruns, according to the Government Accountability 
        Office in March 2014.
            (50) On October 1, 2013, HealthCare.gov launched without 
        adequate security testing, leaving the approximately 250,000 
        unique users it drew not only vulnerable to identity theft by 
        hackers, but unable to even use the site, as the website was 
        demonstrably unable to handle even 1,100 simultaneous users.
            (51) For the subsequent months after its launch, 
        HealthCare.gov continued to be plagued by crippling 
        malfunctions, and the dismal performance of the website led 
        only to problems and frustration for millions of Americans.
            (52) A June 2013 study by the Department of Health and 
        Human Services' Office of Inspector General revealed that 
        software designed by a principal HealthCare.gov vendor was 
        highly insecure and put the information of more than 6 million 
        Medicare beneficiaries at ``greater risk from malware, 
        inappropriate access or theft''.
            (53) An April 2014 study by Avalere Health determined that 
        38 percent of health insurance plans offered on the exchanges 
        under the Affordable Care Act had no information about drug 
        coverage available. Avalere also found that nearly 1 in 4 plans 
        offered insufficient information on which doctors and hospitals 
        are covered.
            (54) In September 2014, the Administrator of the Centers 
        for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported to Congress that 
        7.3 million Americans had enrolled in plans through exchanges 
        under the Affordable Care Act, meeting enrollment targets 
        estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and held as a goal 
        by the Obama Administration.
            (55) Four months later, HHS Secretary Burwell stated that 
        this enrollment data was a ``mistake'' that included some 
        400,000 dental insurance enrollments, the inclusion of which 
        allowed the administration to claim for months that the 
        Affordable Care Act was performing as anticipated which was not 
        in fact a true or accurate representation of the data they had, 
        but would not release to the public.
            (56) Since implementation of the ACA began, the HHS 
        Secretary has granted over $1 billion in Federal taxpayer 
        dollars to States to help build websites for their own State-
        based exchanges, yet development and usability issues on short 
        timelines repeatedly caused these same States to seek different 
        options for the 2015 open enrollment period, including opting 
        to revert to enrolling via the Federal HealthCare.gov website.
            (57) The Affordable Care Act provides opportunities for 
        fraud within subsidy and tax credit issuance.
            (58) A September 2013 report by the Treasury Inspector 
        General for Tax Administration concluded that, ``the IRS's 
        existing fraud detection system may not be capable of 
        identifying ACA refund fraud or schemes prior to the issuance 
        of tax return refunds.''.
            (59) A July 2014 undercover study by the Government 
        Accountability Office determined that fictitious applicants 
        were able to obtain health insurance coverage and taxpayer-
        funded subsidies on the Federal exchanges using falsified 
        documents in 11 out of 12 cases.
            (60) The Affordable Care Act has had a negative impact on 
        the American economy.
            (61) A February 2014 calculation by the Congressional 
        Budget Office found the Affordable Care Act will significantly 
        harm the American economy, reducing the number of hours worked 
        by millions of full-time employees worth of hours. The CBO 
        study noted, ``The reduction in CBO's projections of hours 
        worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-
        equivalent workers of about 2 million in 2017, rising to about 
        2.5 million in 2024.''.
            (62) History has shown the Special Inspector General model 
        to be successful at saving taxpayer dollars and rooting our 
        waste, fraud, and abuse in large Federal Government programs.
            (63) Congress and the President have enacted legislation 
        creating Special Inspectors General on three occasions, 
        including to oversee Federal spending and policy implementation 
        for Afghanistan reconstruction (SIGAR), Iraq reconstruction 
        (SIGIR), and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP).
            (64) SIGAR, SIGIR, and SIGTARP have successfully conducted 
        audits and investigations saving the Federal Government 
        billions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and have helped to 
        identify and prosecute theft and corruption.
            (65) As of an October 2014 report, SIGAR has produced 57 
        referrals for suspension and debarment of Federal contractors 
        and employees and produced over $500 million in direct taxpayer 
        savings.
            (66) According to its final report, SIGIR cost $245 million 
        to operate, but resulted in $645 million in direct savings to 
        the Federal Government, in addition to producing $192 million 
        in seizures and court-ordered penalties, as well as 90 criminal 
        convictions.
            (67) As of an October 2014 report, SIGTARP has produced 146 
        convictions and $7.38 billion in fines, penalties, and 
        restitution to the Government and victims.
            (68) On August 5, 2014, the Associated Press reported that 
        47 Federal inspectors general sent an unprecedented joint 
        letter to Congress to decry, ``Obama administration efforts to 
        delay or stall their investigations,'' citing three examples 
        where Federal agencies have hindered substantive inspector 
        general oversight work by refusing to provide information or 
        documents they are entitled to under the law.
            (69) The letter from more than half of the Federal 
        Government's independent inspectors general correctly states, 
        ``Section 6(a)(1) of the IG Act reflects the clear intent of 
        Congress that an Inspector General is entitled to timely and 
        unimpeded access to all records available to an agency that 
        relate to that Inspector General's oversight activities. The 
        constricted interpretations of Section 6(a)(1) by these and 
        other agencies conflict with the actual language and 
        Congressional intent. The IG Act is clear: no law restricting 
        access to records applies to Inspectors General unless that law 
        expressly so states, and that unrestricted access extends to 
        all records available to the agency, regardless of location or 
        form.''.
            (70) Congress has a responsibility to exercise prudent 
        stewardship of public dollars, to ensure that laws are well and 
        faithfully executed by the executive branch, to provide for 
        efficacious services for the American people, and to ensure 
        that those who cheat, steal from, or defraud the Federal 
        Government are held to account.
