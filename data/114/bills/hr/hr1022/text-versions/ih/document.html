                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to authorize the use of 
   Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant 
             Program funding to counter violent extremism.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Violent Extremism Grants 
Act'' or the ``CVE Grants Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The recent terrorist attacks in Paris, Sydney, New York 
        City, Ottawa, and London demonstrate that violent Islamist 
        extremism is on the rise and that the threat from homegrown 
        terrorism is growing.
            (2) The United States and the West are the leading targets 
        of Islamist extremist propaganda and terrorist recruitment.
            (3) Terrorist groups are seeking to enlist a new generation 
        of extremists and are using sophisticated tools, including 
        social media, to radicalize across borders.
            (4) State and local authorities are on the frontlines of 
        combating domestic radicalization and need the appropriate 
        tools to deter, detect, and disrupt extremist efforts to 
        influence and recruit Americans.
            (5) Too few initiatives exist to help communities 
        understand the threat, prevent domestic radicalization, counter 
        the narrative of extremists, and provide pathways to 
        deradicalization for individuals who have become radicalized so 
        they do not resort to violence.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the use of 
Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant 
Program funds for countering violent Islamist extremism and to ensure 
that State and local officials are aware that Federal resources are 
available for this urgent homeland security priority.

SEC. 3. USE OF CERTAIN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDS TO COUNTER VIOLENT 
              EXTREMISM.

                    ``(C) the development and implementation of 
                projects to partner with local communities to prevent
