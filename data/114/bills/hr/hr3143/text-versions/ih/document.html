        program in accordance with this section.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the smart energy and water 
        efficiency pilot program is to award grants to eligible 
        entities to demonstrate advanced and innovative technology-
        based solutions that will--
                    (A) increase and improve the energy efficiency of 
                water, wastewater, and water reuse systems to help 
                communities across the United States make significant
