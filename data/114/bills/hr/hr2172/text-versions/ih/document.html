of this Act, the Secretary shall establish and implement a pilot 
program to develop a toll credit marketplace for States to buy and sell 
toll credits.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the pilot program are--
            (1) to identify whether a monetary value can be assigned to 
        toll credits;
            (2) to identify the discounted rate of toll credits for 
        cash;
            (3) to determine if the purchase of toll credits by States 
        provides the purchasing State budget flexibility to deal with 
        funding issues, including off-system needs, transit systems 
        with high operating costs, or cash flow issues; and
            (4) to test the feasibility of expanding the toll credit 
        market to allow all States to participate on a permanent basis.
    (c) Administration of Pilot Program.--In carrying out the pilot 
program under this Act, the Secretary, working through the 
Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, shall determine 
how a toll credit marketplace will work and--

        States to offer and bid on toll credit purchases;
            (2) not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, provide notice to States that the Federal Highway 
        Administration requests participants for the toll credit 
        marketplace;
            (3) allow States that maintain a toll credit balance 
        accumulated before the enactment of this Act and States that do 
        not maintain infrastructure for the collection of toll credits 
        or have not accumulated a toll credit balance to participate in 
        the pilot program; and
            (4) not allow a State to purchase or sell toll credits in 
        an amount that is less than 5 percent of the toll credit's 
        value if applied as a non-Federal share requirement under 
        section 120(i)(1) of title 23, United States Code.
    (d) Reporting Requirements.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 180 days after notice 
        of the pilot program is provided to the States under subsection 
        (c)(2), the Secretary shall notify the Committee on 
        Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public 
        Works of the Senate on the progress of the toll credit 
        marketplace.
            (2) State report.--Not later than 30 days after a purchase 
        or sale in the toll credit marketplace, a State selling toll 
        credits shall provide the Administrator of the Federal Highway 
        Administration with information on the transaction, the amount 
        of cash received and the value of toll credits sold, on the 
        intended use of the cash, and an update on the State's 
        remaining toll credit balance. A State purchasing toll credits 
        shall provide the Administrator of the Federal Highway 
        Administration with information on the value of toll credits 
        purchased, the anticipated use of the toll credits, and plans 
        for maintaining maintenance of effort for spending on Federal-
        aid highways projects.
            (3) Annual report.--Not later than 1 year and after notice 
        is given under subsection (c)(2) and each year thereafter that 
        the pilot program is in effect, the Secretary shall submit a
