SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE AVAILABILITY OF PERSONALIZED 
              HANDGUNS FROM FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARMS DEALERS.

    (a) Requirements.--Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(m)(1) Each licensed dealer shall maintain a personalized handgun 
in the sales inventory of the licensed dealer, prominently display a 
personalized handgun at the location specified on the license to deal 
in firearms issued to the licensed dealer under this chapter, and offer 
a personalized handgun for sale to members of the public who are not 
prohibited by law from possessing a handgun.
    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a pawnbroker or a person who 
deals in only antique firearms.''.
    (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of such title is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(36) Personalized Handgun.--The term `personalized handgun' means 
a handgun that--
            ``(A) enables only an authorized user of the handgun to 
        fire the handgun; and
            ``(B) was manufactured in such a manner that the firing 
        restriction described in subparagraph (A)--
                    ``(i) is incorporated into the design of the 
                handgun; and
                    ``(ii) cannot be removed or deactivated by anyone 
                other than such an authorized user.
    ``(37) Authorized User.--The term `authorized user', with respect 
to a handgun, means the lawful owner of the handgun and any individual 
authorized by the owner to use the handgun who is allowed to own, 
carry, or use a firearm in the State where the firearm is being 
used.''.
    (c) Penalties for Noncompliance.--Section 924 of such title is 
amended by adding at the end the following;
    ``(q) Penalties Relating to Availability of Personalized 
Firearms.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Escalating penalties.--In the case of a 
                violation of section 923(m)(1) by a licensed dealer, 
                the Attorney General shall, after notice and 
                opportunity for hearing, impose such civil penalties as 
                the Attorney General deems appropriate.
                    ``(B) Review.--An action of the Secretary under 
                subparagraph (A) may be reviewed only as provided under 
                section 923(f).
            ``(2) Administrative remedies.--The imposition of a civil 
        penalty under paragraph (1) shall not preclude any 
        administrative remedy that is otherwise available to the 
        Secretary.''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date the National Institute of Justice causes to be 
published in the Federal Register a certification at least 2 different 
models of personalized handguns (as defined in section 921(a)(36) of 
title 18, United States Code) are available commercially in sufficient 
quantities to enable licensed dealers (as defined in paragraph (11) of 
such section) to comply with the amendments. The National Institute of 
Justice may not cause such a certification to be so published with 
respect to a model of personalized handgun that does not fire at least 
as reliably as the average non-personalized handgun.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
