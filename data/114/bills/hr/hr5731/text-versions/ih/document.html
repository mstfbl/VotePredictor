                        (A) is made with respect to such employee;

        requirements of this paragraph solely by reason of making 
        contributions on behalf of employees at a rate greater than 50 
        cents per hour, but only if such contributions are made at the 
        same rate for all qualifying employees of the employer.
            (4) Notices.--The requirements of this paragraph shall not 
        be treated as met with respect to any year unless the employer

                or treated as elected under paragraph (2), and
                    (B) the opportunity to elect under paragraph 
                (2)(B)(i) to not make elective contributions.
            (5) Treatment of contributions.--All contributions with 
        respect to an employee made under a SAVE UP Account 
        contribution program shall be nonforfeitable and shall be paid

        employee's SAVE UP Account under section 103.
            (6) Wage growth adjustment.--
                    (A) In general.--In the case of calendar years 
                beginning after 2016, the 50 cent amount in paragraph 
                (3) shall be increased by the average annual wage 
                growth adjustment.
                    (B) Average annual wage growth adjustment.--For 
                purposes of subparagraph (A), the average annual wage 
                growth adjustment for any calendar year is the 
                percentage (if any) by which--
                            (i) the national average wage index (as 
                        defined in section 219(k)(1) of the Social 
                        Security Act) for the preceding calendar year, 
                        exceeds
                            (ii) the national average wage index (as so 
                        defined) for 2015.

SEC. 105. BENEFITS IN THE FORM OF AN ANNUITY.

    (a) In General.--A SAVE UP Account shall pay benefits in the form 
of an annuity in accordance with subsection (b). The amount of such 
benefits shall be based on the amounts credited to the individual's 
SAVE UP Account and the form of distribution the individual elects. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the amount of an annuity may be 
adjusted to reflect the experience of the Fund as necessary to protect 
the financial integrity of the Fund, except that annuity payments for 
those in pay status shall not be reduced more than 5 percent per year 
unless the Fund is faced with a significant financial hardship and the 
SAVE UP Board of Governors has approved the reduction.
    (b) Annuity.--SAVE UP Accounts shall pay benefits in accordance 
with one of the following:
            (1) In the case of a participant who does not die before 
        the annuity starting date, the benefit payable to such 
        participant shall be provided in the form of a qualified joint 
        and survivor annuity (as defined in section 205(d)(1) of the 
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
        1055(d)(1))).
            (2) In the case of a participant who dies before the 
        annuity starting date and who has a surviving spouse, a 
        qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 
        205(d)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
        1974 (29 U.S.C. 1055(d)(2))) shall be provided to the surviving 
        spouse of such participant.
            (3) In lieu of a qualified joint and survivor annuity form 
        of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form 
        of benefit (or both), a participant may elect to receive a 
        distribution described in subsection (f)(3) if one of the 
        following conditions are met:
                    (A)(i) The spouse of the participant consents in 
                writing to the election.
                    (ii) Such election designates a beneficiary (or 
                form of benefits) which may not be changed without 
                spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly 
                permits designations by the participant without any 
                requirement of further consent by the spouse).
                    (iii) The spouse's consent acknowledges the effect 
                of such election and is witnessed by a plan 
                representative or a notary public.
                    (B) It is established to the satisfaction of a Fund 
                representative that the consent required under clause 
                (i) cannot be obtained because there is no spouse, 
                because the spouse cannot be located, or because of 
                such other circumstances as the SAVE UP Board of 
                Governors may by regulations prescribe. The consent of 
                a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse 
                cannot be obtained) under this subparagraph shall be 
                effective only with respect to such spouse.
    (c) Commencement of Benefit Payments.--A participant may elect the 
time to start receiving benefit payments under this section, except 
that a participant--
            (1) may not elect to receive benefit payments before 
        reaching the age of 62; and
            (2) must begin receiving benefit payments before the age of 
        70.
    (d) Notice.--Each Fund shall provide to each participant, within a 
reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date, a written 
explanation substantially similar to that required by section 205(c)(3) 
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
1055(c)(3)).
    (e) Assignment or Alienation of Fund Benefits.--Benefits under a 
SAVE UP Account shall be subject to section 206(d) of the Employee
