    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Access to 
Banking Act''.
    (b) Purpose.--This purposes of this Act are the following:
            (1) To expand banking services to unbanked and underbanked

        Corporation to re-assess regulations to allow non-profit 
        community development financial institution banks to obtain 
        deposit insurance, while still adequately protecting the 
        Deposit Insurance Fund.
            (2) To facilitate an insured depository institution 
        structure that benefits from philanthropic donations, 
        investment incentives from the Community Reinvestment Act of 
        1977, and Community Development Financial Institution Fund 
        grants.

                    (B) allow charitable contributions and grants to

        Insurance Corporation shall terminate the deposit insurance of
