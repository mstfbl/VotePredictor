        requirements of this subsection.

        rate of postage established for the Combating Invasive Species

            (3) Duration.--The Combating Invasive Species Semipostal

        enactment of this Act.
            (4) Disposition of proceeds.--All amounts becoming 
        available from the sale of the Combating Invasive Species 
        Semipostal Stamp (as determined under section 416(d) of such 
        title) shall be transferred in equal proportion to the 
        Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, 
        for the purpose described in subsection (a), through payments 
        which shall be made at least twice a year.
