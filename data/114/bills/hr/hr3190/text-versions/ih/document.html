     To amend title 31, United States Code, to enhance the Federal 
  Government's planning and preparation for extreme weather, and the 
  Federal Government's dissemination of best practices to respond to

                                 A BILL


 
     To amend title 31, United States Code, to enhance the Federal 
  Government's planning and preparation for extreme weather, and the 
  Federal Government's dissemination of best practices to respond to 
  extreme weather, thereby increasing resilience, improving regional 
    coordination, and mitigating the financial risk to the Federal 
                 Government from such extreme weather.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preparedness and Risk Management for 
Extreme Weather Patterns Assuring Resilience and Effectiveness Act of 
2015'' or the ``PREPARE Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office included the need 
        to address extreme weather in its 2013 and 2015 High Risk List 
        by declaring that this complex, cross-cutting issue ``presents 
        a significant financial risk to the Federal Government'' and 
        that the Government would be better positioned to respond to 
        extreme weather events if the Federal efforts were more 
        coordinated.
            (2) The GAO further found that there are no programs to 
        monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and 
        sustainability of agency measures to address the challenges 
        posed to Federal insurance programs by extreme weather and that 
        there is not a systematic method to distribute information to 
        State and local governments.
            (3) The United States has sustained 178 weather-related 
        disasters since 1980 where overall costs reached or exceeded $1 
        billion, with a total cost exceeding $1 trillion.
            (4) In the past four years, extreme weather events resulted 
        in 253 Presidential major disaster declarations, 1,286 
        fatalities, and $227 billion in economic losses with 42 of 
        these events each inflicting at least $1 billion in damage.
            (5) In 2012, the Federal Government spent nearly $100 
        billion because of droughts, storms, floods, and forest fires, 
        and the costs of extreme weather in the United States totaled 
        almost 1 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product.
            (6) Every dollar spent on hazard mitigation brings a $4 
        return on investment.
            (7) The Federal Government has a number of non-permanent 
        efforts underway to address extreme weather, including those 
        outlined in Executive Order 13693, in Executive Order 13653, in 
        Executive Order 13690, in Homeland Security Presidential 
        Directive 20, in Presidential Policy Directive 8, and in 
        individual Agency Adaptation Plans.
            (8) The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force 
        recommendations included taking a resiliency approach to 
        planning, design, and rebuilding in order to mitigate impacts 
        of future extreme weather-related events.
            (9) In order to help communities plan for future extreme 
        weather-related events, the National League of Cities urges the 
        Federal Government to provide financial and technical 
        assistance to help local governments assess vulnerabilities and 
        mitigate such future events and to share best practices and 
        resiliency strategies.
            (10) According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, 
        future impacts of extreme weather project national economic 
        losses on the order of $1.2 trillion through 2050.
            (11) The property insurance industry called for State and 
        local governments to adopt measures to increase resilience to 
        present and future risks of extreme weather and for the sharing 
        of ``science-based information'' to better inform public policy 
        and decisionmaking at all levels of government and commerce.
