                        specialty or other expertise clinically 
                        relevant to the device under review; and

        such representative) for the purpose of correcting 
        misstatements of fact or providing clarifying information, 
        subject to the discretion of panel chairperson.''.
            (2) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the 
        following new subparagraph:
                    ``(B)(i) Any meeting of a classification panel with 
                respect to the review of a premarket submission for a 
                device shall--
                            ``(I) provide adequate time for initial 
                        presentations by the person whose premarket 
                        submission is specifically the subject of such 
                        review and by the Secretary; and
                            ``(II) encourage free and open

                described in clause (i), the panel may--
                            ``(I) pose questions to a designated 
                        representative described in subparagraph 
                        (A)(iii); and
                            ``(II) consider the responses to such 
                        questions in the panel's review of the 
                        premarket submission.''.
