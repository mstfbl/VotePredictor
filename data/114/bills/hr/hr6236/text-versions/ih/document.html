                                 A BILL


 
  To elevate the teaching profession through systemic innovations in 
 teacher recruitment and retention to ensure that students, especially 
those from low-income families, are taught by excellent, well-prepared, 
          and well-supported teachers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Innovations to Recruit and Retain 
Excellent Teachers Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The rise of teacher shortages found across the Nation, 
        particularly in high-needs schools and high-needs fields, 
        including special education, STEM, and English language 
        learners, threatens the ability of schools to ensure our 
        Nation's students are prepared to participate in the 21st 
        century workforce.
            (2) Enrollment in educator preparation programs has dropped 
        significantly in recent years, jeopardizing the workforce 
        pipeline at a time when a large portion of the current 
        workforce is set to retire.
            (3) High-needs schools and field experience elevated levels 
        of teacher turnover, which negatively affects student 
        achievement and school culture.
            (4) Teacher retention is often undermined by low wages, 
        poor working conditions, lack of sufficient resources and 
        insufficient supports, which include mentoring, inductions, 
        meaningful professional development, and career advancement 
        opportunities.
            (5) Our Nation's schools are experiencing a severe 
        diversity gap that negatively impacts student achievement and 
        school culture--50 percent of current students are from 
        minority groups while only 18 percent of teachers are, 
        according to a 2016 study by the Brookings Institute.
            (6) According to a 2016 study by the Learning Policy 
        Institute, America is on the brink of a teacher shortage 
        crisis, propelled by a decrease of 240,000 teachers in the last 
        five years. The Learning Policy Institute predicts that, unless 
        teacher workforce patterns change, our schools will face a 
        100,000 teacher shortage annually.
            (7) High-needs schools are often served by high percentages 
        of inexperienced, ineffective, and out-of-field teachers, which 
        can negatively impact both teacher retention and student 
        achievement.
            (8) Certain types of local educational agencies, including 
        those that are rural and those that are high-poverty, are 
        uniquely impacted by challenges of recruitment and retention, 
        making targeted support to address the unique challenges faced 
        by certain types of local educational agencies critical.
            (9) Structured, well-implemented career continuums for 
        teachers that include teacher leadership options (such as 
        hybrid roles whereby expert teachers both teach and contribute 
        other skills such as mentoring) have a positive impact on 
        teacher recruitment and retention.
            (10) Principals and other school leaders who are skilled in 
        supporting teachers and teacher leadership roles are critical 
        to the success of teaching and learning.
            (11) Stakeholders at the Federal, State, and local levels 
        must make targeted, purposeful efforts to address these 
        challenges to elevate, strengthen, and build the capacity of 
        the teaching profession.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To transform the profession of teaching to ensure that 
        every school, including high-needs schools, provides a 
        rewarding, sustainable, and successful experience for all 
        teachers through--
                    (A) strengthening recruitment of excellent and 
                diverse teacher candidates;
                    (B) supporting stronger teacher entry training and 
                onboarding; and
                    (C) increase teacher retention rates through the 
                provision of high quality professional development, 
                improved working conditions, professional leadership 
                opportunities, and improved compensation systems.
            (2) To study best practices for recruiting and retaining a 
        diverse and excellent teacher workforce, reducing beginning 
        teacher turnover and turnover due to low salaries, filling 
        teacher vacancies in high-need areas and in shortage subjects, 
        providing better pay and additional leadership opportunities to 
        teachers, and improving working conditions and teacher 
        satisfaction overall.
