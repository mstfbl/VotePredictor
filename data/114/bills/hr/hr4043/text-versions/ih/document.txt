            (1) in paragraph (1)(H)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding clause (i)--
                            (i) by striking ``during the school year in 
                        which the application is submitted'';
                            (ii) by inserting ``age 23 or younger'' 
                        after ``unaccompanied youth''; and
                            (iii) by striking ``terms are'' and 
                        inserting ``term is'';
                    (B) in clause (i), by inserting ``, or a designee 
                of the liaison'' after ``Act'';
                    (C) in clause (ii), by striking ``a program funded 
                under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act'' and 
                inserting ``an emergency or transitional shelter, 
                street outreach program, homeless youth drop-in center, 
                or other program serving homeless youth,''; and
                    (D) in clause (iii), by striking ``program funded 
                under subtitle B of title IV of the McKinney-Vento 
                Homeless Assistance Act (relating to emergency shelter 
                grants)'' and inserting ``Federal TRIO program or a 
                Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate 
                program under chapter 1 or 2 of subpart 2 of part A,''; 
                and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Simplifying the determination process for 
        unaccompanied youth.--
                    ``(A) Verification.--A financial aid administrator 
                shall accept a homelessness determination made by any 
                individual authorized to make such determinations under 
                clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (1)(H) in the 
                absence of conflicting information. A documented phone 
                call with, or a written statement from, one of the 
                authorized individuals is sufficient verification when 
                needed. For purposes of this paragraph, a financial aid 
                administrator's disagreement with the determination 
                made by an authorized individual shall not be 
                considered conflicting information.
                    ``(B) Determination of independence.--A financial 
                aid administrator shall make a determination of 
                independence under paragraph (1)(H) if a student does 
                not have, and cannot get, documentation from any of the 
                other designated authorities described in such 
                paragraph. This determination is based on the 
                definitions outlined in paragraph (1)(H) and is 
                distinct from a determination of independence under 
                paragraph (1)(I). The determination may be based on a 
                documented interview with the student if there is no 
                written documentation available. A financial aid 
                administrator shall limit such determination to whether 
                the student meets the definitions in paragraph (1)(H) 
                and shall not inquire about the reasons for the 
                student's homelessness.

                                application; and
