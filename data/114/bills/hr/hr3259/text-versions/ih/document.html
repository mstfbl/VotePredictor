              OF IRAN.

President is authorized to take such actions as may be necessary to 
detain--
            (1) non-diplomatic officials of the Government of Iran in 
        the United States; and
            (2) non-diplomatic officials of the Government of Iran in 
        any other country if the government of such country provides 
        authority in advance to the United States to take such actions 
        to detain such officials in such country.
    (b) Sunset.--The authority of subsection (a) shall expire on the 
date on which the United States citizens described in section 1 have 
been released and returned to the United States or the date on which 
the Government of Iran provides to the United States Government a full
