        requirements may have been applied pursuant to subsection (b) 
        of such section. For purposes of such section, a Program plan

                                        in such unit; and

                        notice under clause (i), convert the delivery 
                        points for which consent was received to the 
                        applicable new primary mode of mail delivery;

                        address unit is the converted primary mode of 
                        mail, regardless of the primary mode of mail 
                        delivery for the previous occupant.
    ``(f) Considerations.--In making a determination to convert the 
primary mode of mail delivery under this section, the Postal Service 
shall consider--
            ``(1) the impact of weather conditions, physical barriers, 
        or any other factor that may impact the feasibility of 
        providing a primary mode of mail delivery other than door 
        delivery (such as a factor that may significantly reduce the 
        potential cost savings associated with providing centralized 
        delivery or curbside delivery);
            ``(2) whether the address is in a registered historic 
        district (as that term is defined in section 47(c)(3)(B) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986), is listed on the National 
        Register of Historic Places, is designated as a National 
        Historic Landmark, or is of historic value; and
            ``(3) population density and the concentration of poverty.
    ``(g) Waiver for Physical Hardship.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Postal Service shall establish and 
        maintain a waiver program under which, upon application, door 
        delivery may be continued, or provided, for a delivery point 
        identified under subsection (d)(1) or (e)(1) at no cost to the 
        applicant in any case in which--
                    ``(A) centralized delivery, curbside delivery, or 
                sidewalk delivery would, but for this paragraph, 
                otherwise be the primary mode of mail delivery; and
                    ``(B) door delivery is necessary in order to avoid 
                causing significant physical hardship or physical 
                safety risks to a postal patron.
            ``(2) Treatment of waiver.--An address receiving door 
        delivery pursuant to a waiver under this subsection--
                    ``(A) shall be counted, for purposes of the 
                reporting requirement under subsection (j), as an 
                address that receives the primary mode of mail delivery 
                which the address would be subject to if not for the 
                waiver; and
                    ``(B) shall, not later than 60 days after ceasing 
                to meet the requirements of paragraph (1), be converted 
                to the primary mode of mail delivery which is otherwise 
                applicable.
    ``(h) Procedures.--In carrying out conversions under this section, 
the Postal Service shall establish procedures to--
            ``(1) solicit, consider, and respond to input from the 
        general public, postal patrons, State and local governments, 
        local associations, and property owners;
            ``(2) calculate and make publicly accessible the cost or 
        savings of the conversion to the Postal Service as well as the 
        average conversion cost or savings to each postal patron and 
        any cost or savings to the State and local government; and
            ``(3) place centralized delivery points in locations that 
        maximize delivery efficiency, ease of use for postal patrons, 
        and respect for private property rights.
    ``(i) Voucher Program.--The Postal Service shall provide for a 
voucher program under which, upon application, the Postal Service may 
defray all or any portion of the costs associated with conversion from 
door delivery under this section which would otherwise be borne by 
postal patrons.
    ``(j) Annual Report.--Not later than 60 days after the end of each 
of fiscal years 2017 through 2023, the Postal Service shall submit to 
Congress and the Inspector General a report on the implementation of 
this section during the most recently completed fiscal year. Each such 
report shall include--
            ``(1) the number of residential and business addresses 
        that--
                    ``(A) receive door delivery as of the end of the 
                fiscal year preceding the most recently completed 
                fiscal year;

                most recently completed fiscal year; and
                    ``(C) during the most recently completed fiscal 
                year, were converted from door delivery to--
                            ``(i) centralized delivery;
                            ``(ii) curbside delivery; and
                            ``(iii) any other primary mode of mail 
                        delivery;

        Service toward meeting the requirements of the phaseout under 
        subsection (c); and
            ``(4) any other information which the Postal Service 
        considers appropriate.
    ``(k) Inspector General Audit.--The Inspector General shall issue 
an annual audit report on the implementation of this section not later 
than 90 days after the date on which the Postal Service releases its 
annual report under subsection (j). Such report shall include--
            ``(1) an audit of the data contained in the Postal 
        Service's report under subsection (j); and
            ``(2) an evaluation of the Postal Service's implementation 
        of the voucher program under subsection (i).
    ``(l) Review.--Subchapters IV and V shall not apply with respect to 
any action taken by the Postal Service under this section.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 36 of 
title 39, United States Code, is amended by adding after the item 
relating to section 3691 the following:

        enactment of this Act, the Postal Service shall begin to 
        collect data on delivery mode costs and the potential savings 
        of converting to more cost-efficient primary modes of mail 
        delivery.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Postal Service shall submit a report 
        to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the 
        House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security 
        and Governmental Affairs of the Senate describing the findings 
        of the study conducted under paragraph (1).
    (d) Inspector General Review of Costs and Benefits of Delivery 
Point Conversions.--
            (1) Study.--Not later than 2 years after the date on which

        pursuant to subsections (d)(2) and (e)(2) of section 3692 of 
        title 39, United States Code (as added by subsection (a)), and 
        not later than 3 years thereafter, the Inspector General of the 
        Postal Community shall conduct a study of the costs and 
        benefits of such conversions.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which 
        the Inspector General conducts each study required under 
        paragraph (1), the Inspector General shall submit to the 
        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of 
        the House of Representatives a report on the results of each 
        study.
            (3) Content.--The studies required under paragraph (1) 
        shall assess the following:
                    (A) The cost savings realized by the Postal Service 
                from the conversions under subsections (d)(2) and 
                (e)(2) of section 3692 of title 39, United States Code 
                (as added by subsection (a)), and the projected cost 
                savings the Postal Service is likely to realize from 
                full implementation of such conversions.
                    (B) The expenses incurred by the Postal Service to 
                achieve such conversions and the projected expenses the 
                Postal Service is likely to incur from full 
                implementation of such conversions.
                    (C) The impact of the conversions on--

                described under such subsections.
            (4) Net cost benefit analysis.--The Inspector General shall 
        conduct a cost benefit analysis to determine the net cost or

            ``(1) The effect of rate increases upon the general public 
        and business mail users.
            ``(2) The available alternative means of sending and 
        receiving written communications, information, and letters and 
        other mail matter at reasonable costs.
            ``(3) The reliability of delivery timelines and the extent 
        to which the Postal Service is meeting its service standard 
        obligations.
            ``(4) The need to ensure that the Postal Service has 
        adequate revenues and has taken appropriate cost-cutting 
        measures to maintain financial stability and meet all legal 
        obligations.
            ``(5) The extent to which the Postal Service has taken 
        actions to increase its efficiency and reduce its costs.
            ``(6) The value of the mail service actually provided by 
        each class or type of mail service to both the sender and the 
        recipient, including but not limited to the collection, mode of 
        transportation, and priority of delivery.
            ``(7) The requirement that each class of mail or type of 
        mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs 
        attributable to each class or type of mail service through 
        reliably identified causal relationships plus that portion of 
        all other costs of the Postal Service reasonably assignable to 
        such class or type.
            ``(8) The degree of preparation of mail for delivery into 
        the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon 
        improving efficiency and reducing costs to the Postal Service.

        simple, identifiable relationships between the rates or fees 
        charged the various classes of mail for postal services.

        increased mail volume and operational efficiency.
            ``(11) The relative value to the people of the kinds of 
        mail matter entered into the postal system and the desirability 
        and justification for special classifications and services of 
        mail.
            ``(12) The importance of providing classifications with 
        extremely high degrees of reliability and speed of delivery and

the Postal Regulatory Commission shall promulgate (and may from time to 
time thereafter revise) regulations for streamlined after-the-fact 
review of newly proposed agreements between the Postal Service and 
users of the mail that provide rates not of general applicability for 
competitive products. Streamlined review shall apply only if agreements 
are functionally equivalent to existing agreements that have 
collectively covered attributable costs and collectively improved the 
net financial position of the Postal Service. The regulations issued 
under this subsection shall provide that streamlined review shall be 
concluded not later than 5 business days after the date on which the 
agreement is filed with the Commission and shall be limited to approval 
or disapproval of the agreement as a whole based on the Commission's 
determination of its functional equivalence. Agreements not approved 
may be resubmitted without prejudice under section 3632.''.

                        a competitive disadvantage relative to a
