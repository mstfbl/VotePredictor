To amend the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to establish a Working 
Waterfront Task Force and a working waterfronts grant program, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep America's Waterfronts Working 
Act''.

SEC. 2. WORKING WATERFRONTS GRANT PROGRAM.

    The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 320. WORKING WATERFRONTS GRANT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Findings and Purpose.--The Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Findings.--
                    ``(A) Water-dependent commercial activities are the 
                economic and cultural heart of many coastal 
                communities. These activities include commercial 
                fishing, recreational fishing businesses, tourism, 
                aquaculture, boatbuilding, transportation, and many 
                other water-dependent businesses.
                    ``(B) Water-dependent commercial activities depend 
                on coastal access in the form of--
                            ``(i) docks, wharfs, boat lifts, wet and 
                        dry marinas, and boat ramps;
                            ``(ii) boat hauling, repair, and 
                        construction facilities;
                            ``(iii) commercial fishing facilities; and
                            ``(iv) other support structures on, over, 
                        or adjacent to navigable bodies of water.
                    ``(C) The coastal zone of the United States is 
                experiencing rising property values and taxes, and 
                related development pressure, as more people move to 
                the coastal zone and as coastal areas experience a 
                demographic shift favoring wealthier individuals.
                    ``(D) Privately owned access areas for water-
                dependent commercial activity in many States are under 
                increasing threat from private residential development 
                and other conversion.
                    ``(E) Loss of access for water-dependent commercial 
                activity would have economically and culturally 
                devastating consequences for many coastal communities.
            ``(2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to preserve 
        and protect coastal access for persons engaged in water-
        dependent commercial activities, including commercial fishing, 
        recreational fishing businesses, aquaculture, boatbuilding, or 
        other water-dependent coastal-related businesses.
    ``(b) Working Waterfront Task Force.--
            ``(1) Establishment and functions.--The Secretary of the 
        Interior shall establish a task force to identify and address 
        critical needs with respect to working waterfronts.
            ``(2) Membership.--The members of the task force shall be 
        appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, and shall include--
                    ``(A) experts in the unique economic, social, 
                cultural, ecological, geographic, and resource concerns 
                of working waterfronts; and
                    ``(B) representatives from the National Oceanic and 
                Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Services Center, 
                the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
                Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection 
                Agency, the United States Geological Survey, the Navy, 
                the National Marine Fisheries Service, and such other 
                Federal agencies as the Secretary considers 
                appropriate.
            ``(3) Functions.--The task force shall--
                    ``(A) identify and prioritize critical needs with 
                respect to working waterfronts in States that have a 
                management program approved by the Secretary of 
                Commerce pursuant to section 306, in the areas of--
                            ``(i) economic and cultural importance of 
                        working waterfronts to communities;
                            ``(ii) changing environments and threats 
                        working waterfronts face from environment 
                        changes, trade barriers, and marketplace 
                        variables; and

                        highlighting them within communities;
                    ``(B) outline options to address such critical 
                needs;
                    ``(C) identify Federal agencies that are 
                responsible under existing law for addressing such 
                critical needs; and
                    ``(D) recommend Federal agencies best suited to 
                address any critical needs for which no agency is 
                responsible under existing law.
            ``(4) Information to be considered.--In identifying and 
        prioritizing policy gaps pursuant to paragraph (3), the task 
        force shall consider the findings and recommendations contained 
        in section VI of the report entitled `The Sustainable Working 
        Waterfronts Toolkit: Final Report', dated March 2013.
            ``(5) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        the enactment of this section, the task force shall submit a 
        report to Congress on its findings.
            ``(6) Implementation.--The head of each Federal agency 
        identified in the report pursuant to paragraph (3)(C) shall 
        take such action as is necessary to implement the 
        recommendations contained in the report by not later than 1 
        year after the date of the issuance of the report.
    ``(c) Working Waterfront Grant Program.--
            ``(1) The Secretary shall establish a Working Waterfront 
        Grant Program, in cooperation with appropriate State, regional, 
        and other units of government, under which the Secretary may 
        make a grant to any coastal state for the purpose of 
        implementing a working waterfront plan approved by the 
        Secretary under subsection (d).
            ``(2) Subject to the availability of appropriations, the 
        Secretary shall award matching grants under the program to 
        coastal states with approved working waterfront plans through a 
        regionally equitable, competitive funding process in accordance 
        with the following:
                    ``(A) The Governor, or the lead agency designated 
                by the Governor for coordinating the implementation of 
                this section, where appropriate in consultation with 
                the appropriate local government, shall determine that 
                the application is consistent with the State's or 
                territory's approved coastal zone plan, program, and 
                policies prior to submittal to the Secretary.
                    ``(B) In developing guidelines under this section, 
                the Secretary shall consult with coastal states, other 
                Federal agencies, and other interested stakeholders 
                with expertise in working waterfront planning.
                    ``(C) Coastal states may allocate grants to local 
                governments, agencies, or nongovernment organizations 
                eligible for assistance under this section.
            ``(3) In awarding a grant to a coastal state, the Secretary 
        shall consider--
                    ``(A) the economic and cultural significance of 
                working waterfront to the coastal state;
                    ``(B) the demonstrated working waterfront needs of 
                the coastal state as outlined by a working waterfront 
                plan approved for the coastal state under subsection 
                (d), and the value of the proposed project for the 
                implementation of such Plan;

                among participating entities, including Federal

                government units, landowners, corporations, or private 
                organizations;

                ownership of working waterfront in the coastal state, 
                and where applicable the need for coastal states to 
                respond quickly when properties in existing or 
                potential working waterfront areas or public access 
                areas as identified in the working waterfront plan 
                submitted by the coastal state come under threat or 
                become available;

                the coastal ecosystem and the users of the coastal 
                ecosystem; and

                working waterfronts and the local communities within 
                the coastal state.
            ``(4) The Secretary shall approve or reject an application 
        for such a grant within 60 days after receiving an application 
        for the grant.
    ``(d) Working Waterfront Plans.--
            ``(1) To be eligible for a grant under subsection (c), a 
        coastal state must submit and have approved by the Secretary a 
        comprehensive working waterfront plan in accordance with this 
        subsection or be in the process of developing such a plan and 
        have an established working waterfront program at the State or 
        local level.

        is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the property will 
        be managed in a manner that is consistent with the purposes for

        coastal state may allocate to a unit of local government, 
        nongovernmental organization, fishing cooperative, or other 
        entity, a portion of any grant made under this section for the 
        purpose of carrying out this section, except that such an 
        allocation shall not relieve the coastal state of the

        (1) for any qualified holder that is an underserved community, 
        a community that has an inability to draw on other sources of 
        funding because of the small population or low income of the 
        community, or for other reasons the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.

        under subsection (h) may utilize funds or other in-kind 
        contributions donated by a nongovernmental partner to satisfy 
        the matching funds requirement under this subsection.

        section, the Secretary shall require that a coastal state 
        provide to the Secretary such assurances as the Secretary 
        determines are sufficient to demonstrate that the share of the 
        cost of each eligible project that is not funded by the grant 
        awarded under this section has been secured.

        only a portion of the total cost of a project, funding from 
        other Federal sources may be applied to the cost of the 
        project. Each portion shall be subject to match requirements 
        under the applicable provision of law.

        value of a working waterfront or interest in a working 
        waterfront, including conservation and other easements, that is 
        held in perpetuity by a qualified holder, if the working 
        waterfront or interest is identified in the application for the 
        grant and acquired by the qualified holder within 3 years of 
        the grant award date, or within 3 years after the submission of 
        the application and before the end of the grant award period. 
        Such value shall be determined by an appraisal performed at 
        such time before the award of the grant as the Secretary 
        considers appropriate.
            ``(7) The Secretary shall treat as non-Federal match the 
        costs associated with acquisition of a working waterfront or an 
        interest in a working waterfront, and the costs of restoration, 
        enhancement, or other improvement to a working waterfront, if 
        the activities are identified in the project application and 
        the costs are incurred within the period of the grant award, 
        or, for working waterfront described in paragraph (6), within 
        the same time limits described in that paragraph. These costs 
        may include either cash or in-kind contributions.

funds made available to the Secretary under this section may be used by 
the Secretary for planning or administration of the program under this 
section.

            ``(1) Up to 5 percent of the funds appropriated under this

                appropriations, planning grants and assistance, pilot 
                projects, feasibility studies, and other projects
