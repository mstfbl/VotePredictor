                disposal island.
                    ``(B) A discharge of dredged material in connection 
                with--
                            ``(i) beneficial use; or
                            ``(ii) habitat establishment, improvement, 
                        or restoration (or any combination thereof).
            ``(3) Temporary waivers.--The Secretary (or a State with an 
        approved permit program under this section) may waive 
        application of the prohibition established by paragraph (1) 
        during the 2-year period beginning on the effective date of the 
        prohibition specified in paragraph (1) with respect to a 
        discharge if--
                    ``(A) the Administrator or State, as appropriate, 
                determines that the waiver is necessary and 
                appropriate; and
                    ``(B) in the case of a waiver issued by the 
                Secretary, each concerned State, as identified by the

System, the Secretary of the Army shall exclude from consideration the 
use of open-water placement of dredged material.

or otherwise affect the existing responsibilities of the Corps of 
Engineers--

        and dispose of dredged material; and
            (2) to provide, within its budget, for the full cost of the 
        disposal of dredged material, including costs to comply with 
        the requirements of this section, including the amendment made 
        by subsection (a).
