  of the Armed Forces upon their initial entry into the Armed Forces.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stepping up for American Workers and 
Troops Act''.

SEC. 2. COMPLIANCE WITH DOMESTIC SOURCE REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOTWEAR 
              FURNISHED TO ENLISTED MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES UPON 
              THEIR INITIAL ENTRY INTO THE ARMED FORCES.

    Section 418 of title 37, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d)(1) In the case of athletic footwear needed by members of the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps upon their initial entry into 
the armed forces, the Secretary of Defense shall furnish such footwear 
directly to the members instead of providing a cash allowance to the 
members for the purchase of such footwear.
    ``(2) In procuring athletic footwear to comply with paragraph (1), 
the Secretary of Defense shall comply with the requirements of section 
2533a of title 10, without regard to the applicability of any 
simplified acquisition threshold under chapter 137 of title 10 (or any 
other provision of law).
    ``(3) This subsection does not prohibit the provision of a cash 
allowance to a member described in paragraph (1) for the purchase of 
athletic footwear if such footwear--
            ``(A) is medically required to meet unique physiological 
        needs of the member; and
            ``(B) cannot be met with athletic footwear that complies 
        with the requirements of this subsection.''.
                                 <all>
