To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through 
the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration,

to provide qualified sexual risk avoidance education to youth and their 
                                parents.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Relationships Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. SEXUAL RISK AVOIDANCE EDUCATION.

    (a) Grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services 
Administration, may award grants on a competitive basis to public and 
private entities to provide qualified sexual risk avoidance education 
to youth and their parents.
    (b) Qualified Sexual Risk Avoidance Education.--To qualify for 
funding under subsection (a), sexual risk avoidance education shall 
meet each of the following:
            (1) The primary emphasis and context for each topic covered 
        through the funding shall be the unambiguous message that 
        postponing sexual activity is the optimal sexual health 
        behavior for youth.
            (2) The education shall be medically accurate.
            (3) The education shall be an evidence-based approach.
            (4) The education shall be age-appropriate.
            (5) The education shall thoroughly address each of the 
        following:
                    (A) The holistic individual and societal benefits 
                associated with personal responsibility, success 
                sequencing, self-regulation, goal setting, healthy 
                decisionmaking, and a focus on the future.
                    (B) The research-based advantage of reserving 
                sexual activity for marriage, as associated with 
                poverty prevention and optimal physical and emotional 
                health for all youth, regardless of previous sexual 
                experience.
                    (C) The skills needed to resist the pervasive, sex-
                saturated culture that portrays teenage sexual activity 
                as an expected norm, with few risks or negative 
                consequences.
                    (D) The foundational components of healthy 
                relationships and their impact on the formation of 
                healthy marriages and safe and stable families.
                    (E) How to avoid sexual coercion, dating violence, 
                and risk behaviors, such as drugs, alcohol, and the 
                misuse of social media.
            (6) The education shall ensure that any information 
        provided on contraception--
                    (A) emphasizes the superior health benefits of 
                sexual delay; and
                    (B) does not exaggerate the effectiveness of 
                contraception in preventing the physical and non-
                physical consequences of teenage sexual activity.
    (c) Priority.--In awarding grants under subsection (a), the 
Secretary shall give priority to applicants proposing programs to 
provide qualified sexual risk avoidance education that--
            (1) serves youth throughout the middle and high school 
        grades; and
            (2) will promote parent-child communication regarding 
        healthy sexual decisionmaking.

        peer-reviewed research by medical, educational, scientific,
