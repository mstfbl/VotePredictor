                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Asbestos Information Act of 1988 to establish a public 
database of asbestos-containing products, to require public disclosure 
of information pertaining to the manufacture, processing, distribution, 
 and use of asbestos-containing products in the United States, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Exposure to Asbestos 
Database Act of 2015'' or the ``READ Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency has classified asbestos as a category A human 
        carcinogen, the highest cancer hazard classification for a 
        substance;
            (2) the International Agency for Research on Cancer has 
        classified asbestos as a class 1 human carcinogen;
            (3) despite the enactment of the Asbestos Information Act 
        of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public Law 100-577), which sought 
        to improve transparency and public awareness of the presence of 
        asbestos in commercial materials and products, many people in 
        the United States still incorrectly believe that--
                    (A) asbestos has been banned in the United States; 
                and
                    (B) there is no risk of exposure to asbestos 
                through the use of new commercial products;
            (4) asbestos is still being imported and used, and is 
        otherwise present as a contaminant, in some consumer and 
        industrial products in the United States;
            (5) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
        manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in 
        commerce of many asbestos-containing products are not banned in 
        the United States, including--
                    (A) cement corrugated sheet;
                    (B) cement flat sheet;
                    (C) clothing;
                    (D) pipeline wrap;
                    (E) roofing felt;
                    (F) vinyl floor tile;
                    (G) cement shingle;
                    (H) millboard;
                    (I) cement pipe;
                    (J) automatic transmission components;
                    (K) clutch facings;
                    (L) friction materials;
                    (M) disc brake pads;
                    (N) drum brake linings;
                    (O) brake blocks;
                    (P) gaskets;
                    (Q) non-roofing coatings; and
                    (R) roof coatings;
            (6) consumers and workers are at risk of asbestos exposure, 
        and families of workers are also put at risk because of 
        asbestos brought home by the workers on the shoes, clothes, 
        skin, and hair of the workers;
            (7) the Environmental Working Group estimates that as many 
        as 10,000 citizens of the United States die each year from 
        mesothelioma and other asbestos-related diseases;
            (8) the National Institutes of Health reported to Congress 
        that mesothelioma is a difficult disease to detect, diagnose, 
        and treat;
            (9) mesothelioma responds poorly to conventional 
        chemotherapy, and although new combination treatments for 
        mesothelioma have demonstrated some benefits--
                    (A) the median survival period for mesothelioma is 
                only 1 year after diagnosis of the disease; and
                    (B) the majority of mesothelioma patients die 
                within 2 years of diagnosis of the disease; and
            (10) until asbestos is completely banned from being used in 
        or imported into the United States, transparent and accessible 
        information about the location and identity of asbestos and 
        asbestos-containing products in the United States is necessary 
        to better protect consumers, workers, families, and the people 
        of the United States.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE.

    The Asbestos Information Act of 1988 (15 U.S.C. 2607 note; Public 
Law 100-577) is amended--
            (1) in section 4--
                    (A) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as 
                paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively; and
                    (B) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:
            ``(3) Asbestos-containing product.--The term `asbestos-
        containing product' means any product (including any part) to 
        which asbestos is deliberately or knowingly added or in which 
        asbestos is deliberately used or knowingly present in any 
        concentration.'';
            (2) in section 2, by inserting ``(referred to in this Act 
        as the `Administrator')'' after ``Administrator of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 5. ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCT DATABASE.
