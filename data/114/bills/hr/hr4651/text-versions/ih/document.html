SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Today, more than ever before, digital security and 
        communications technology, national security, public safety, 
        and counterterrorism are inextricably linked; indeed, digital 
        security and communications technology plays a critically 
        important role in efforts to keep the United States and its 
        citizens safe.
            (2) Technological innovation and development is critical to 
        the United States economy and the competitiveness of United 
        States businesses in the global marketplace.
            (3) Technology companies represent some of the largest 
        employers in the United States and contribute significantly to 
        the gross domestic product of the United States.
            (4) The digital security and communications technology that 
        the people of the United States use every day to protect 
        communications and data, including encryption, is essential to 
        the present and future of the United States.
            (5) Digital security and communications technology helps to 
        protect critical infrastructure, financial and banking systems, 
        health records, online security, commercial transactions, 
        proprietary enterprise and governmental information, and 
        privacy and civil liberties.
            (6) The same technology that benefits the people of the 
        United States in so many ways also presents new challenges; in 
        the wrong hands, digital security and communications technology 
        can be used to facilitate crime and terrorism and is used by 
        malicious actors, including drug traffickers, child predators, 
        and cybercriminals, to carry out criminal activities.
            (7) Terrorist and criminal organizations use digital 
        security and communications technology to evade law enforcement 
        and national security entities when plotting attacks and 
        recruiting supporters in the United States and abroad, and law 
        enforcement and national security authorities have indicated 
        that the use of this technology presents unique challenges to 
        their ability to protect the public.
            (8) Rapidly evolving technological advancements drive the 
        modern economy in many ways, but can also create challenges for 
        the law enforcement and national security communities.
            (9) Ensuring that analysts, law enforcement officers, and 
        policymakers fully understand the dynamic digital landscape 
        will become increasingly important in the coming decades.
            (10) The United States currently faces the difficult 
        question of how best to take advantage of the security and 
        privacy benefits digital security and communications technology 
        provides, while at the same time ensuring that the dangers 
        posed by the use of digital security and communications 
        technology by terrorists and criminals is mitigated; indeed, 
        the challenge is to reconcile equally important security 
        interests.
            (11) Despite years of dialogue between the technology 
        sector, law enforcement, national security professionals, and 
        others, no clear path forward has been developed that would 
        benefit each of the critical security interests simultaneously; 
        rather, there seems to be a consensus among stakeholders, 
        lawmakers, and experts that the question of reconciling 
        competing security interests is one without an easy or obvious 
        answer.
            (12) Leading experts and practitioners from the technology 
        sector, cryptography, law enforcement, intelligence, the 
        privacy and civil liberties community, global commerce and 
        economics, and the national security community must be brought 
        together to examine these issues in a systematic, holistic way 
        and determine the implications for national security, public 
        safety, data security, privacy, innovation, and American 
        competitiveness in the global marketplace.
            (13) It is important to approach these issues with 
        recognition that the communications marketplace is increasingly 
        global and marked by competition from foreign firms and the 
        growing prominence of international technical standards.
            (14) With respect to competing security interests, it is 
        incumbent upon the United States to be forward-thinking and to 
        assess how it can and should adapt to the emerging challenges 
        of the digital world.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND 
              TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES.

    (a) In General.--There is established in the legislative branch a

                        technology on Federal, State, and local 
                        criminal investigations and counterterrorism 
                        enterprises;
                            (v) the costs of weakening cryptography and 
                        digital security and communications technology 
                        standards; and
                            (vi) international laws, standards, and 
                        practices regarding legal access to 
                        communications and data protected by 
                        cryptography and digital security and 
                        communications technology, and the potential 
                        effect the development of disparate, and 
                        potentially conflicting, laws, standards, and 
                        practices might have.
                    (C) Recommendations for policy and practice, 
                including, if the Commission determines appropriate, 
                recommendations for legislative changes, regarding--
                            (i) methods to be used to allow the United 
                        States Government and civil society to take 
                        advantage of the benefits of digital security 
                        and communications technology while at the same 
                        time ensuring that the danger posed by the 
                        abuse of digital security and communications 
                        technology by terrorists and criminals is 
                        sufficiently mitigated;
                            (ii) the tools, training, and resources 
                        that could be used by law enforcement and 
                        national security agencies to adapt to the new 
                        realities of the digital landscape;
                            (iii) approaches to cooperation between the 
                        Government and the private sector to make it 
                        difficult for terrorists to use digital 
                        security and communications technology to 
                        mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize 
                        attacks;
                            (iv) any revisions to the law applicable to 
                        wiretaps and warrants for digital data content 
                        necessary to better correspond with present and 
                        future innovations in communications and data 
                        security, while preserving privacy and market

                            (v) proposed changes to the procedures for 
                        obtaining and executing warrants to make such 
                        procedures more efficient and cost-effective 
                        for the Government, technology companies, and 
                        telecommunications and broadband service 
                        providers; and
                            (vi) any steps the United States could take 
                        to lead the development of international 
                        standards for requesting and obtaining digital 
                        evidence for criminal investigations and 
                        prosecutions from a foreign, sovereign State, 
                        including reforming the mutual legal assistance
