SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF LOTTERY WINNINGS AND OTHER LUMP SUM INCOME FOR 
              PURPOSES OF INCOME ELIGIBILITY UNDER MEDICAID.

    (a) In General.--Paragraph (14) (relating to modified adjusted 
gross income) of section 1902(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396a(e)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
                    ``(J) Treatment of certain lottery winnings and 
                income received as a lump sum.--
                            ``(i) In the case of an individual who is 
                        the recipient of qualified lottery winnings or 
                        qualified lump sum income, and whose 
                        eligibility for medical assistance is 
                        determined based on the application of modified 
                        adjusted gross income under subparagraph (A), a 
                        State may, in determining such eligibility, 
                        consider such winnings or income (as 
                        applicable) as income received on a monthly 
                        basis--
                                    ``(I) if such winnings or income 
                                (as applicable) is received in an 
                                amount that is less than $50,000, over 
                                a period of 12 months; and
                                    ``(II) if such winnings or income 
                                (as applicable) is received in an 
                                amount that is greater than or equal to 
                                $50,000, over a period specified by the 
                                State not to exceed 240 months, in 
                                proportion to the amount of the 
                                winnings or income (as applicable).
                            ``(ii) Definitions.--In this subparagraph:
                                    ``(I) The term `qualified lottery 
                                winnings' means winnings from a 
                                sweepstakes, lottery, or pool described 
                                in paragraph (3) of section 4402 of the 
                                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or a 
                                lottery operated by a multi-state or 
                                multi-jurisdictional lottery 
                                association in an amount that is not 
                                less than $20,000, including amounts 
                                awarded as a lump sum payment.
                                    ``(II) The term `qualified lump sum 
                                income' means income that is received 
                                as a lump sum in an amount that is not 
                                less than $20,000, including income 
                                received from the transfer or sale of 
                                real or personal property from the 
                                estate (as defined in section 
                                1917(b)(4)) of a deceased 
                                individual.''.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
as preventing a State from intercepting the State lottery winnings 
awarded to an individual in the State to recover amounts paid by the 
State under the State Medicaid plan under title XIX of the Social 
Security Act for medical assistance furnished to the individual.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to income received as a lump sum, or winnings 
received pursuant to lotteries occurring, after a date specified by the 
State, but not earlier than the date that is 24 months before such date 
of enactment.
