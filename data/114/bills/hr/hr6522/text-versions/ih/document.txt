    (a) Qualifying Legislation Defined.--In this section, the term

            (1) that is introduced by the Chairman or ranking member of

            (3) consists solely of the following provisions:
                    (A) Provisions that allow for a short title, 
                findings, or other text that does not affect the 
                authority or responsibility of the President or a 
                department or agency of the Federal Government.
                    (B) Provisions that implement not less than 80 
                percent of the cost savings in the Department of 
                Defense as identified by the Defense Business Board in 
                the study titled ``Transforming Department of Defense's 
                Core Business Processes for Revolutionary Change'' and 
                submitted to Congress pursuant to section 2.
    (b) Consideration.--
            (1) Committee referral.--Qualifying legislation that is 
        introduced in the House of Representatives shall be referred to 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives. Qualifying legislation introduced in the 
        Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Armed Services of 
        the Senate.
            (2) Reporting and discharge.--If the committee to which 
        qualifying legislation is referred has not reported the 
        qualifying legislation within 10 session days after the date of 
        referral of the legislation, the committee shall be discharged 
        from further consideration of the legislation, and the 
        qualifying legislation shall be placed on the appropriate 
        calendar of the House involved.
            (3) Consideration.--On or after the third day after the 
        date on which the committee to which qualifying legislation is 
        referred has reported, or has been discharged under paragraph 
        (2) from further consideration of, such legislation, it is in 
        order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has 
        been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to 
        move to proceed to the consideration of the qualifying 
        legislation. A Member may make the motion only on the day after 
        the calendar day on which the Member announces to the House 
        concerned the Member's intention to make the motion, except 
        that, in the case of the House of Representatives, the motion 
        may be made without such prior announcement if the motion is 
        made by direction of the committee to which the qualifying 
        legislation was referred. All points of order against the 
        qualifying legislation (and against consideration of the 
        qualifying legislation) are waived. The motion is highly 
        privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in 
        the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to 
        amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to 
        proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to 
        the consideration of the qualifying legislation is agreed to, 
        the respective House shall immediately proceed to consideration 
        of the qualifying legislation without intervening motion, 
        order, or other business, and the qualifying legislation shall 
        remain the unfinished business of the respective House until 
        disposed of.
            (4) Debate.--Debate on qualifying legislation, and on all 
        debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be 
        limited to not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided 
        equally between, and controlled by, the Majority Leader and the 
        Minority Leader or their designees. A motion to further limit 
        debate is in order and not debatable. The only amendments to 
        the qualifying legislation that are in order are amendments 
        that seek to ensure the qualifying legislation meets the 
        criteria under subsection (a)(3). A motion to postpone, or a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
        motion to recommit the qualifying legislation is not in order. 
        A motion to reconsider the vote by which the qualifying 
        legislation is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.
            (5) Vote on passage.--Immediately following the conclusion 
        of the debate on the qualifying legislation and a single quorum 
        call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance 
        with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final 
        passage of the qualifying legislation shall occur.
            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may 
        be, to the procedure relating to qualifying legislation shall 
        be decided without debate.
    (c) Consideration by Other House.--
            (1) In general.--If, before the passage by one House of 
        qualifying legislation of that House, that House receives from 
        the other House qualifying legislation, then the following 
        procedures shall apply:
                    (A) The qualifying legislation of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee and may not be 
                considered in the House receiving it except in the case 
                of final passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii).
                    (B) With respect to any qualifying legislation of 
                the House receiving the qualifying legislation--
                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no qualifying legislation had 
                        been received from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                        the qualifying legislation of the other House.
            (2) Disposition.--Upon disposition of the qualifying 
        legislation received from the other House, it shall no longer 
        be in order to consider the qualifying legislation that 
        originated in the receiving House.
    (d) Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.--This section 
is enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of qualifying legislation described in 
        subsection (a)(1), and supersedes other rules only to the 
        extent that this section is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
                                 <all>
