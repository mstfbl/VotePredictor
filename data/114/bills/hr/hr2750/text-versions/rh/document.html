                                 A BILL


 
   To reform programs of the Transportation Security Administration, 
streamline transportation security regulations, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Security Vetting for 
Aviation Workers Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. AVIATION SECURITY.

    (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title XVI of the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 561 et seq.) is amended by adding after section 
1601 the following new section:

``SEC. 1602. VETTING OF AVIATION WORKERS.

    ``(a) In General.--By not later than December 31, 2015, the 
Administrator, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Policy 
of the Department, shall request from the Director of National 
Intelligence access to additional data from the Terrorist Identities 
Datamart Environment (TIDE) data and any or other terrorism-related 
information to improve the effectiveness of the Administration's 
credential vetting program for individuals with unescorted access to 
sensitive areas of airports.
    ``(b) Security Inspection.--By not later than December 31, 2015, 
the Administrator shall issue guidance for Transportation Security 
Inspectors to annually review airport badging office procedures for 
applicants seeking access to sensitive areas of airports. Such guidance 
shall include a comprehensive review of applicants' Criminal History 
Records Check (CHRC) and work authorization documentation during the 
course of an inspection.
    ``(c) Information Sharing.--By not later than December 31, 2015, 
the Administrator may conduct a pilot program of the Rap Back Service, 
in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, to determine the feasibility of full implementation of a 
service through which the Administrator would be notified of a change 
in status of an individual holding a valid credential granting 
unescorted access to sensitive areas of airports across eligible 
Administration-regulated populations.
    ``(d) Procedures.--The pilot program under subsection (c) shall 
evaluate whether information can be narrowly tailored to ensure that 
the Administrator only receives notification of a change with respect 
to a disqualifying offense under the credential vetting program under 
subsection (a), as specified in 49 C.F.R. 1542.209, and in a manner 
that complies with current regulations for fingerprint-based criminal 
history records checks. The pilot program shall be carried out in a 
manner so as to ensure that, in the event that notification is made 
through the Rap Back Service of a change but a determination of arrest 
status or conviction is in question, the matter will be handled in a 
manner that is consistent with current regulations. The pilot program 
shall also be carried out in a manner that is consistent with current 
regulations governing an investigation of arrest status, correction of 
Federal Bureau of Investigation records and notification of 
disqualification, and corrective action by the individual who is the 
subject of an inquiry.
    ``(e) Determination and Submission.--If the Administrator 
determines that full implementation of the Rap Back Service is feasible 
and can be carried out in a manner that is consistent with current 
regulations for fingerprint-based criminal history checks, including 
the rights of individuals seeking credentials, the Administrator shall 
submit such determination, in writing, to the Committee on Homeland 
Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate, together with information on 
the costs associated with such implementation, including the costs 
incurred by the private sector. In preparing this determination, the 
Administrator shall consult with the Chief Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties Officer of the Department to ensure that protocols are in 
place to align the period of retention of personally identifiable 
information and biometric information, including fingerprints, in the 
Rap Back Service with the period in which the individual who is the 
subject of an inquiry has a valid credential.
    ``(f) Credential Security.--By not later than September 30, 2015, 
the Administrator shall issue guidance to airports mandating that all 
federalized airport badging authorities place an expiration date on 
airport credentials commensurate with the period of time during which 
an individual is lawfully authorized to work in the United States.
    ``(g) Aviation Worker Lawful Status.--By not later than December 
31, 2015, the Administrator shall review the denial of credentials due 
to issues associated with determining an applicant's lawful status in 
order to identify airports with specific weaknesses and shall 
coordinate with such airports to mutually address such weaknesses, as 
appropriate.
    ``(h) Reports to Congress.--Upon completion of the determinations 
and reviews required under this section, the Administrator shall brief 
the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the results of 
such determinations and reviews.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to 
section 1601 the following new item:

``Sec. 1602. Vetting of aviation workers.''.

SEC. 3. STATUS UPDATE ON RAP BACK SERVICE PILOT PROGRAM.

    Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration shall 
submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of 
the Senate a report on the status of plans to conduct a pilot program 
in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Rap 
Back Service in accordance with subsection (c) of section 1602 of the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added by section 2 of this Act. The 
report shall include details on the business, technical, and resource 
requirements for the Transportation Security Administration and pilot 
program participants, and provide a timeline and goals for the pilot 
program.
