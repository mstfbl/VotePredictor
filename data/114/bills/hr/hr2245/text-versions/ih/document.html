                                 A BILL


 
  To require the Federal Trade Commission to consider including Smart 
          Grid capability on Energy Guide labels for products.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. INCLUSION OF SMART GRID CAPABILITY ON ENERGY GUIDE LABELS.

    Section 324(a)(2) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
U.S.C. 6294(a)(2)) is amended by adding the following at the end:
                    ``(J)(i) Not later than 1 year after the date of 
                enactment of this subparagraph, the Commission shall 
                initiate a rulemaking to consider making a special note 
                in a prominent manner on any Energy Guide label for any 
                product that includes Smart Grid capability that--
                            ``(I) Smart Grid capability is a feature of 
                        that product;
                            ``(II) the use and value of that feature 
                        depend on the Smart Grid capability of the 
                        utility system in which the product is 
                        installed and the active utilization of that 
                        feature by the customer; and
                            ``(III) on a utility system with Smart Grid 
                        capability, the use of the product's Smart Grid 
                        capability could reduce the customer's cost of 
                        the product's annual operation by an estimated 
                        dollar amount range representing the result of 
                        incremental energy and electricity cost savings 
                        that would result from the customer taking full 
                        advantage of such Smart Grid capability.
                    ``(ii) Not later than 3 years after the date of 
                enactment of this subparagraph, the Commission shall 
                complete the rulemaking initiated under clause (i).''.
