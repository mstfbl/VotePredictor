SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Government has a treaty obligation to 
        provide health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives.
            (2) The Indian Health Service is the Federal agency that is 
        entrusted to carry out this obligation.
            (3) Access to high quality health care is critical for 
        strong and vibrant tribal communities in the Great Plains Area 
        and throughout the United States.
            (4) In 2010, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs 
        published a report titled ``In Critical Condition: The Urgent 
        Need to Reform the Indian Health Service's Aberdeen Area'', 
        which detailed deficiencies, abuses, and malfeasance within the 
        Aberdeen Area of the Indian Health Service, now called the 
        Great Plains Area.
            (5) In 2015 and 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
        Services conducted surveys of Indian Health Service hospitals 
        in the Great Plains Area and found serious structural 
        deficiencies that put patients' health and safety in immediate 
        jeopardy.
            (6) The Indian Health Service's failures in the Great 
        Plains Area have resulted in a severe reduction in access to 
        emergency care, needlessly long wait times, patient suffering, 
        low quality of life, and several tragic deaths.
            (7) The Indian Health Service is in need of comprehensive 
        reform that will hold its management and employees accountable, 
        foster strong and capable agency leadership, and restore tribal 
        members' trust in the care it delivers.

      TITLE I--EXPANDING AUTHORITIES AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE

                        or service.
                            (ii) Limitation.--The amount applied under 
                        clause (i) for an item or service shall be an 
                        amount that is at least the amount of the

                        rate, as defined by the Secretary of Health and 
                        Human Services, for an item or service, as 
                        evidenced by commercial price lists or paid 
                        invoices and other related pricing and discount

                                under the negotiation under clause (i) 
                                is fair and reasonable, as determined 
                                by the I/T/U, even though comparable 
                                discounts were not negotiated; and
                                    (II) the amount is otherwise in the

                with subparagraph (A), the I/T/U will pay the lowest of

                        item or service, including payment according to 
                        a fee schedule, a prospective payment system or 
                        based on reasonable cost for the period in 
                        which the service was provided, or in the event 
                        of a Medicare waiver, the payment amount will 
                        be calculated in accordance with such waiver. 
                        For purposes of this paragraph, the amount 
                        described in this clause shall be referred to 
                        as the ``Medicare rate''.
                            (ii) An amount negotiated by a repricing 
                        agent if the provider or supplier is 
                        participating within the repricing agent's 
                        network and the I/T/U has a pricing arrangement 
                        or contract with that repricing agent.
                            (iii) An amount not to exceed the provider 
                        or supplier's most favored customer rate 
                        described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for such item 
                        or service, as evidenced by commercial price 
                        lists or paid invoices and other related 
                        pricing and discount data to ensure that the I/
                        T/U is receiving a fair and reasonable price, 
                        but only to the extent such evidence is 
                        reasonably accessible and available to the I/T/
                        U.
                    (C) Other.--The method described in this 
                subparagraph is that, in the case that a Medicare rate 
                does not exist for an item or service, and no other 
                method described in a previous subparagraph is 
                accessible or available, the amount shall be deemed to 
                be 65 percent of authorized charges for such item or 
                service.
            (2) Coordination of benefits and limitation on recovery.--
        If an I/T/U has authorized payment for items and services 
        provided to an individual who is eligible for benefits under 
        title XVIII of the Social Security Act, title XIX of such Act, 
        or another third-party payer, the following shall apply:
                    (A) The I/T/U shall be the payer of last resort 
                under section 2901(b) of the Patient Protection and 
                Affordable Care Act (25 U.S.C. 1623(b)).
                    (B) If there are any third-party payers, the I/T/U 
                shall pay the amount for which the patient is being 
                held responsible after the provider or supplier of 
                services has coordinated benefits and all other 
                alternate resources have been considered and paid, 
                including applicable copayments, deductibles, and 
                coinsurance that are owed by the patient.
                    (C) The maximum payment by the I/T/U shall be only 
                the portion of the payment amount determined under this

                applicable payment amount under paragraph (1)(B) for

                            (i) the item or service was provided based

        information from the individual, or as applicable, the provider 
        or supplier, necessary to make a decision. A notification of a

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
acting through the Director of the Indian Health Service, shall submit

Purchased/Referred Care program (formerly referred to as the `contract 
health services program') funded by the Indian Health Service and

and initiate procedures under subchapter III of chapter 5 of title 5, 
United States Code, to negotiate or promulgate regulations to develop 
and implement a revised distribution formula in accordance with the 
subsequent subsections of this section.
    ``(b) Considerations.--In developing the revised distribution 
formula under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--
            ``(1) the extent to which services are available at a 
        Service hospital or facility of the Service rather than the 
        mere existence of such a hospital or facility;
            ``(2) population growth and the potential for population 
        growth;
            ``(3) the socioeconomic makeup of the population of each 
        contract health service delivery area;
            ``(4) the geographic makeup of each contract health service 
        delivery area;
            ``(5) the size of the hospital or facility;
            ``(6) the relative regional cost of purchasing services;
            ``(7) actual counts of Purchased/Referred Care users; and
            ``(8) accreditation problems at the Service hospital or 
        facility of the Service.

under subsection (a) shall be implemented not later than the date that 
is 3 years after the first October 1 following the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
    ``(d) Transition.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of

        before the implementation date of the revised distribution 
        formula under subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide for 
        the distribution of funds, with respect to direct health care 
        services provided by a Service facility, pursuant to the

        provided by any other facility under such program, at the 
        option of such facility) be consistent with the following:
                    ``(A) During any portion of such period for which a 
                Service area has been designated as a high IHS level 
                area under paragraph (2)(B), such area shall not 
                receive any funds pursuant to such program in addition 
                to the base allotment determined under the distribution 
                formula under the program for 2016 with respect to such 
                area.
                    ``(B) In the case that during such period the 
                amount of funds made available to the Service for such 
                distribution under such program is in excess of the 
                total amounts of base allotments for distribution under 
                such program for 2016, the Secretary shall distribute 
                such excess amount, in accordance with a methodology 
                specified by the Secretary, to Service areas which for 
                an applicable portion of such period of excess funding 
                have been designated as a low IHS level area under 
                paragraph (2)(A).
            ``(2) Area designations.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
        the Secretary shall, with respect to each contract health 
        service delivery area--

                determine the IHS medical priority level pursuant to 
                section 136.23(e) of title 42, Code of Federal 
                Regulations, of such services; and

                Secretary, of the services so provided in the area were 
                determined to have--

                        such area as a high IHS level area.
    ``(e) Application of Reduction Clause.--In the case of a facility 
that, as of the date of the enactment of this section, is under 
contract with the Secretary with respect to the Purchased/Referred Care 
program and such contract applies to a period to which subsection (d) 
or the revised distribution formula under subsection (a) applies, if 
application of subsection (d) or the revised distribution formula 
results in the distribution of an amount of funds to such facility 
during such period that is less than the amount of funds that would be 
provided during such period to such facility under such contract with 
respect to the Purchased/Referred Care program before application of 
such subsection (d) or such revised distribution formula, respectively,

and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450j-1(b)) reduce such amount 
accordingly to be consistent with such subsection (d) or revised 
distribution formula, respectively.

supersede a Tribe's self-governance contract under the Indian Self-
Determination and Education Assistance Act.

frequently than once every 3 years and not less frequently than once 
every five years, review and, as necessary, update the formula 
implemented under subsection (a).
