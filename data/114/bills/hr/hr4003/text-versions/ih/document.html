  To require reports on agency rules with criminal penalties for the 
violation thereof, to evaluate the necessity and prudence of such rules 
                          remaining in effect.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Reporting Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON REGULATIONS WITH CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
head of each Federal agency, in consultation with the Attorney General, 
shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a 
report that lists each rule of that agency that, if violated, may be 
punished by criminal penalties. The report shall include, for each such 
rule, a justification as to why those criminal penalties are necessary 
based on the following criteria:
            (1) Why civil penalties are inadequate to deter the 
        regulated behavior.
            (2) What mens rea or criminal intent is required for 
        criminal liability arising from a violation of the rule.
            (3) What notice is provided to persons subject to the rule 
        that a violation of the rule may result in criminal penalties.
            (4) If the rule applies to all persons, including natural 
        persons as well as corporations and other business 
        associations.
            (5) If a violation of the rule is likely to result in any 
        of the following (and if so, how):
                    (A) Substantial bodily injury or death to another 
                person.
                    (B) Property damage or destruction.
                    (C) Harm to public safety.
                    (D) Harm to national security.
                    (E) Fraud against the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
