medium sized unmanned aerial systems could be used in an attack, how to 
   prevent or mitigate the effects of such an attack, and for other 
                               purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment

SEC. 2. DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission research how commercially available small 
and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 
pounds could be used to perpetuate an attack and, based on such 
research, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop policies, 
guidance, and protocols to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risks 
of such an attack. Not later than 180 days after the completion of the 
research required under this subsection, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security may provide, as appropriate, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman 
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission advice, based on such research, 
regarding how to best prevent and mitigate the risk of such an attack.
    (b) Dissemination to State and Local Officials.--The Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall disseminate information to State, local, and 
tribal law enforcement officials and State and major urban area fusion 
centers, as appropriate, regarding how such officials may bolster 
preparedness for and responses to attacks perpetrated by commercially 
available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft 
over 1,300 pounds.
    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit 
to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate an 
assessment of the security risk associated with commercially available 
small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 
pounds. Such assessment shall be informed by research conducted in 
accordance with subsection (a), shall contain recommendations, if 
applicable, to prevent and mitigate the risk of an unmanned aircraft 
system attack, and may be developed in coordination with the Centers of 
Excellence of the Department of Homeland Security and other academic 
institutions.
            Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to require the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security to research how certain 
        commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft 
        systems could be used in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate 
        the risk of such an attack, and for other purposes.''.
