SEC. 2. PROGRAM TO IMPROVE CARE FOR HIGHEST COST MEDICARE FEE-FOR-
              SERVICE BENEFICIARIES.

    Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended by inserting 
after section 1866E (42 U.S.C. 1395cc-5) the following new section:

  ``program to improve care for highest cost medicare fee-for-service 
                             beneficiaries

    ``Sec. 1866F.  (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall conduct 
under this section a pilot program (in this section referred to as the 
`program') to demonstrate improvements in patient care and cost savings 
for the highest cost Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries through 
enrollment of such beneficiaries with participating organizations. 
Under the program, the Secretary shall, through a competitive process, 
enter into a contract with one or two selected organizations to offer 
benefits for items and services in service areas identified under 
subsection (b)(1)(A) to the highest cost Medicare fee-for-service 
beneficiaries (identified under subsection (c)(1)) in the service area 
involved. The program shall be designed in a manner to provide 
comprehensive and integrated care management and services through a 
network of health care providers to meet the specialized needs of such 
identified beneficiaries.
    ``(b) Conduct of Program.--
            ``(1) Period of operation and scope.--
                    ``(A) Initial conduct.--The program shall initially 
                be conducted over a 3-year period, beginning not later 
                than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
                section, in at least 4 service areas, each identified 
                by the Secretary and each including at least 3 
                contiguous counties.
                    ``(B) Expansion and extension.--The Secretary may 
                expand the program to additional service areas and 
                extend its duration if the Secretary determines, in 
                consultation with the Chief Actuary of the Centers for 
                Medicare & Medicaid Services, that such expansion and 
                extension will result in additional savings to the 
                Medicare program and will meet the quality performance 
                standards established under subsection (d)(3)(A)(iii).
                    ``(C) Relation to part d.--
                            ``(i) In general.--The Secretary shall 
                        design and implement the program in such manner 
                        as to preserve the operation of part D, 
                        including payment, noninterference, and 
                        beneficiary protections under such part.
                            ``(ii) Coordination mechanisms.--The 
                        Secretary shall identify mechanisms that may be 
                        used, in the case of a highest cost Medicare 
                        fee-for-service beneficiary who is enrolled 
                        with a participating organization under the 
                        program and in a prescription drug plan offered 
                        by a PDP sponsor under part D or a qualified 
                        retiree prescription drug plan offered by a 
                        sponsor under section 1860D-22, in order to 
                        enhance coordination of the individual's care 
                        between the organization and the respective 
                        sponsor.
            ``(2) Number of participating organizations per service 
        area.--Under the program the Secretary shall enter into a 
        contract with at least one selected organization (and no more 
        than 2 selected organizations) in each service area identified 
        and covered under the program.
    ``(c) Identification and Enrollment of Highest Cost Medicare Fee-
for-Service Beneficiaries.--
            ``(1) Identification.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of the program, the 
                Secretary shall develop criteria to identify, subject 
                to subparagraph (B), Medicare fee-for-service 
                beneficiaries with projected total costs under parts A 
                and B in the highest 10th percentile of all Medicare 
                fee-for-service beneficiaries on an ongoing basis. Such 
                criteria shall be developed in a manner so as to 
                identify such beneficiaries using the most recent 
                national data available for a 2-year period.
                    ``(B) Refinement of eligibility criteria.--In 
                identifying highest cost Medicare fee-for-service 
                beneficiaries under this paragraph, the Secretary shall 
                develop such criteria in a manner that eliminates, to 
                the extent practicable, the identification of 
                individuals who otherwise appear to meet such criteria 
                only because of a single, isolated high-cost incident, 
                item, or service.
            ``(2) Eligible beneficiary initial outreach.--The Secretary 
        shall inform the highest cost Medicare fee-for-service 
        beneficiaries residing in an area covered by the program of the 
        program and provide them with information about the program and 
        the process for enrollment and disenrollment from participation 
        organizations in such area. Such information shall include 
        information about such organizations, about rights and 
        protections under the program, a contact telephone number where 
        beneficiaries can obtain additional information about the 
        program, and the use of an advance directive (as defined in 
        section 1866(f)(3)) in connection with participation in the 
        program.
            ``(3) Auto-enrollment and disenrollment procedures.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Under the program, the highest 
                cost Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries residing in 
                a service area covered under the program--
                            ``(i) shall be enrolled, in a form and 
                        manner specified by the Secretary, with a 
                        participating organization offered under the 
                        program to such a resident in such area; and
                            ``(ii) may change or terminate such 
                        enrollment in a form and manner so specified.
                In specifying such form and manner, the Secretary shall 
                take into account the form and manner in which 
                individuals may change or terminate an enrollment under 
                a Medicare Advantage plan under part C, including 
                permitting special disenrollment periods described in 
                section 1851(e)(4).
                    ``(B) Default organization selection.--In carrying 
                out subparagraph (A), if there are two participating 
                organizations in a service area, the Secretary shall 
                identify, to the extent possible, and enroll the 
                beneficiary in the participating organization which has 
                providers in its network from whom the beneficiary has 
                received services under the Medicare fee-for-service 
                program in the previous year.
                    ``(C) Timeframes.--In carrying out subparagraph 
                (A), there shall be an initial enrollment period of 12 
                months, during which a highest cost Medicare fee-for-
                service beneficiary may also opt out of participation 
                in the program.
            ``(4) Extension of certain guaranteed issuance rights to 
        medigap coverage in case of disenrollment.--Subparagraph (A) of 
        section 1882(s)(3) shall apply to a Medicare beneficiary 
        enrolled with a participating organization under this section 
        who had previous coverage under a medicare supplemental 
        insurance policy and who terminates enrollment with the 
        participating organization in the same manner as such section 
        applies to an individual described in subparagraph (B)(v) of 
        such section with respect to enrollment with a health plan, 
        regardless of the time period of participation in the program 
        and without regard to subparagraph (E)(ii) of such section.
            ``(5) Treatment of medicare fee-for-service benefits to 
        enrollees through program.--The provisions of section 1851(i) 
        shall apply to individuals enrolled with a participating 
        organization under the program in the same manner as they apply 
        to an individual enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan under 
        part C.
            ``(6) Relation to part d, employer-based prescription drug 
        coverage, and medicare supplemental coverage.--Except as 
        specifically provided, nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as intending to impact on benefits or coverage 
        furnished under a prescription drug plan under part D, under a 
        group health plan (including under a qualified retiree 
        prescription drug plan as defined in section 1860D-22(a)(2)), 
        or under a medicare supplemental policy.

        MA-PD plan under part C, including requirements relating to--

        first year of the program, and, for subsequent years of the 
        program, increased by projected growth in such spending for 
        such beneficiaries.

        the case of an individual who is enrolled with a participating
