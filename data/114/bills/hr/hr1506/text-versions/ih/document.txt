                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Federal Communications Commission to promulgate rules in 
  an open proceeding with respect to updating its competitive bidding 
                                 rules.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Access to Spectrum 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Small businesses create almost half of the Nation's 
        private-sector jobs, including 43 percent of high-tech jobs.
            (2) Wireless services and technology are increasingly 
        driving innovation, investment, and economic growth.
            (3) Consumers benefit from additional choices provided by 
        competition from multiple mobile wireless providers, including 
        small mobile wireless providers.
            (4) Recognizing that the wireless marketplace is a capital-
        intensive industry, Congress charges the Federal Communications 
        Commission with developing rules to help small businesses and 
        encourage competition in spectrum-based services.
            (5) The Commission last comprehensively updated its 
        competitive bidding rules in 2006.
            (6) The upcoming broadcast television spectrum incentive 
        auction offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity to access the 
        spectrum most useful for wireless broadband.

SEC. 3. FCC RULEMAKING.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Federal Communications Commission shall promulgate rules in WT 
Docket No. 14-170.
                                 <all>
