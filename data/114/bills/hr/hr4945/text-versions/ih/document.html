                    (A) Congressional oversight.--The directorate head 
                of any program of NASA, or the head of any program of 
                another agency for which NASA is the acquisition or 
                procurement agent, that exceeds program life cost 
                projections by less than 30 percent but not less than 
                15 percent shall, for each such fiscal year--
                            (i) be available to testify not less than 
                        once before the Committee on Science, Space, 
                        and Technology of the House of Representatives 
                        and once before the Committee on Commerce, 
                        Science, and Transportation of the Senate, if 
                        requested to do so by such committees; and
                            (ii) ensure that staff of such program are 
                        available to update the staff of such 
                        committees on the status of the program not 
                        less than once during each fiscal quarter.
                    (B) Cancellation.--Any program of NASA that exceeds 
                program life cost projections by not less than 30 
                percent shall be cancelled and the Administrator shall 
                not expend any additional funds on the program, other 
                than termination costs, unless Congress authorizes 
                continuation of the program by law not later than 6 
                months after the end of the first fiscal year in which 
                the program first began to exceed such cost projections 
                by such percentage.
            (2) Automatic removal of administrator.--
                    (A) NASA inspector general report.--Not later than 
                6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the

                Administrator a report recommending a mechanism for the 
                automatic removal of an Administrator who has failed to 
                achieve certain goals, which shall take into account--
                            (i) the number of programs of NASA that 
                        exceed cost projections during the tenure of 
                        the Administrator;
                            (ii) the number of programs of NASA 
                        experiencing significant delays with respect to 
                        targeted milestones, launches, or deployments 
                        during the tenure of the Administrator; and
                            (iii) lack of adherence to, or failure to 
                        complete, benchmarks in the long-term plans 
                        developed by the Administrator pursuant to 
                        subsection (e).
                    (B) Implementation.--Not later than 60 days after 
                receipt by the Administrator of the report required 
                under subparagraph (A), NASA shall implement the 
                mechanism outlined in the report.
            (3) Cost projection.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        term ``cost projection'' means, with respect to a program of 
        NASA, the cost commitment of such program as outlined in the 
        Program Memorandum officially documenting the outcome of Key 
        Decision Point A, and for the purposes of this subsection 
        subject to the concurrence of the Committee on Appropriations 
        and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the 
        House of Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations 
        and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of 
        the Senate.
    (h) Transition of Technologies and Capabilities.--NASA shall, 
whenever practicable and appropriate, transition technologies and 
capabilities to actors outside of NASA, including individuals, 
corporations, academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations, to 
the extent that doing so will not threaten national security. Such 
transfers shall be conducted in a transparent manner, and no such 
transfer shall infringe on intellectual property rights or other such 
clauses in NASA contracts.
    (i) Liability Insurance and Financial Responsibility 
Requirements.--
            (1) Amendment.--Section 20138 of title 51, United States

SEC. 203. HUMAN MISSION TO MARS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In section 204 of the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18301 et 
        seq.), Congress required NASA to contract with the National 
        Academies to perform a study of human spaceflight.
            (2) The National Research Council of the National Academies 
        released a report entitled ``Pathways to Exploration: 
        Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space 
        Exploration'' in June of 2014. The report called for Mars to be 
        the ``horizon goal'' for human space exploration.
            (3) NASA continues to request funding levels, follow 
        strategies, and pursue missions that the National Research 
        Council report identified as problematic.
            (4) NASA has yet to provide adequate details or funding 
        requests for a plan to successfully send American astronauts to 
        Mars.
            (5) Billions of dollars have been invested in the Space 
        Launch System and Orion capsule, which represent core elements 
        of deep space exploration systems farthest along in 
        development.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--The following is the sense of Congress:
            (1) NASA should request budget levels, and Congress should 
        continue to appropriate funds and carry out stringent oversight 
        necessary to keep the Space Launch System and Orion capsule on 
        track and on budget.
            (2) Congress should prioritize funding within NASA to meet 
        the budget requirements of sending American astronauts to Mars.
            (3) NASA should utilize the Moon and cislunar space in 
        order to accomplish the goal of sending American astronauts to 
        Mars.
            (4) NASA should utilize commercial assets, when practicable 
        and available, to support exploration beyond Earth orbit, 
        including to Mars.
    (c) Mission to Mars.--Until Americans land on Mars, NASA's main 
human spaceflight priority shall be to land Americans on Mars.
    (d) Activities Related to Mission.--Whenever possible, NASA 
aeronautics and exploration directorates shall seek to avoid developing 
technologies and capabilities that do not have applicability across 
multiple directorates, programs, or activities, including missions to 
Mars.
    (e) International Partnerships.--NASA shall, whenever practicable 
and not restricted by law--
            (1) seek to secure specific investments in capabilities and 
        technologies needed for deep space exploration; and
            (2) clearly communicate what capabilities and technologies 
        are being pursued through international partnerships.
    (f) Strategic Planning.--
            (1) Landing on mars.--The first 20-year plan required under 
        section 202(e)(1) shall designate a 5-year range by which NASA 
        intends for American astronauts to land on the surface of Mars. 
        NASA shall include an update of this range in any subsequent 
        20-year plan developed before such landing occurs.
            (2) National research council concerns.--The first 10-year 
        plan required under section 202(e)(1) shall address the 
        concerns raised by the National Research Council report 
        described in subsection (a)(3), including concerns regarding 
        budget projections, the launch frequency of the Space Launch 
        System, and the efficacy of the Asteroid Redirect Mission. 
        Specifically, the plan shall--
                    (A) provide for the cancellation of the Asteroid 
                Redirect Mission, unless NASA can compellingly 
                demonstrate the mission's utility;
                    (B) explain how NASA intends to avoid missions that 
                lead to dead end technologies; and
                    (C) explain how NASA will look at all options to 
                maximize the utility of early launches of the Space 
                Launch System, including payloads (such as pressurized 
                habitable modules) and experiments.
            (3) Continuous presence beyond low-earth orbit.--Each 10-
        year plan and 20-year plan required under section 202(e)(1) 
        shall specify how NASA intends to maintain a permanent human 
        presence beyond low-Earth orbit.
    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to supersede NASA's long-term goal of human space flight and 
exploration, as provided in section 202(a) of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 
18312(a)), to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth orbit 
and to do so, where practical, in a manner involving international 
partners.

SEC. 204. HUMAN PRESENCE IN LOW-EARTH ORBIT.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should maintain a continuous human 
        presence in low-Earth orbit; and
            (2) activities related to the transport of cargo and crew, 
        development operations, and on-orbit habitats necessary for the 
        purpose of housing Government astronauts and science 
        experiments, should, to the maximum extent practicable, be the 
        purview of the commercial sector.
    (b) International Space Station.--
            (1) Plan.--NASA shall formulate a plan for the remaining 
        life of the International Space Station and continued human 
        presence in low-Earth orbit, which shall be included in the 
        first 10-year plan required under section 202(e)(1) and any 
        subsequent 10-year plans as necessary. The plan required under 
        this paragraph shall--
                    (A) describe how NASA intends to maximize the 
                scientific utilization of the International Space 
                Station;
                    (B) include specific objectives, such as astronaut 
                missions and science experiments, to be carried out 
                during the remaining life of the International Space 
                Station;
                    (C) explore options for turning over the 
                International Space Station to commercial operators;
                    (D) identify a transition strategy for the end of 
                the United States commitment to the International Space 
                Station;
                    (E) be coordinated in conjunction with all 
                countries partner to the International Space Station;
                    (F) explore options for NASA's continued 
                involvement in the International Space Station in the 
                event it is turned over to commercial operators; and
                    (G) seek to ensure a return on investment to United 
                States taxpayers.
            (2) Funding.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
        International Space Station should be fully funded in 
        accordance with the President's annual budget request for the 
        remainder of its needed life.
            (3) Transition strategy.--NASA shall implement a transition 
        strategy for continued human presence in low-Earth orbit 
        identified in the plan pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) as soon as 
        NASA determines that commercial habitats meet the requirements 
        published pursuant to subsection (c)(1) and a demonstration has 
        been successfully completed pursuant to subsection (c)(2).
    (c) Commercial Habitats.--
            (1) Publication of requirements.--Not later than 1 year 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, NASA shall, in 
        coordination with the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory 
        Committee, develop and publish the requirements it considers 
        necessary for commercial contractors to provide on-orbit 
        habitats to meet the human exploration and science missions of 
        NASA, including housing Government astronauts and conducting 
        scientific experiments.
            (2) Pilot program.--Not later than December 31, 2018, NASA 
        shall establish a Commercial Habitat Pilot Program to 
        demonstrate the viability of using commercially built on-orbit 
        habitats that meet the requirements published pursuant to 
        paragraph (1). Under the Pilot Program, NASA shall enter into 
        not less than 1 competitively bid agreement with a private 
        sector entity to demonstrate the viability and capabilities of 
        crewed commercial low Earth orbit platforms. Any such an 
        agreement shall include a commitment by the commercial partner 
        to fund the development and construction of the private sector 
        low-Earth orbit platform. If the private sector entity is 
        successful in funding the fabrication of such a platform, the 
        agreement with NASA shall--
                    (A) provide for the launch of the platform via the 
                addition of a launch to the Commercial Resupply 
                Services program; and
                    (B) include a contingent contract for NASA to 
                utilize no less than 50 percent of the volume of the 
                low-Earth orbit platform for an initial 3-year term.
    (d) Commercial Partnerships for Resupply and Crew of the 
International Space Station and Future Low-Earth Orbit Platforms.--
            (1) In general.--NASA shall continue to utilize 
        partnerships with commercial entities for resupply and crew 
        movement for as long as the United States maintains a human 
        presence in low-Earth orbit.
            (2) Funding.--It is the sense of Congress that NASA should 
        request budget levels, and Congress should continue to 
        appropriate funds and carry out stringent oversight, necessary

SEC. 205. SPACE DEBRIS REMEDIATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the growing population of orbital space debris poses a 
        significant threat to the safety and cost-effectiveness of 
        future civil, commercial, and national security space 
        activities in critical regions of Earth orbit;
            (2) scientific research conducted by NASA and other 
        international space agencies concludes that the amount of 
        orbital space debris will continue to grow at an accelerating 
        rate unless steps are taken to remediate at least some of the 
        existing orbital space debris; and
            (3) the United States Government does not currently have a 
        coherent plan for developing the capabilities for space debris 
        remediation.
    (b) Space Debris Remediation.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Administrator, working in collaboration 
with the Department of Defense, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration, shall submit 
to Congress a report on the feasibility of remediating orbital space 
debris to reduce the collision risk for future space activities. The 
report shall address factors that include--
            (1) an assessment of the types of orbital space debris and 
        orbital altitudes that are the highest priority for 
        remediation;
            (2) a cost-benefit analysis of remediating the high 
        priority space debris objects;
            (3) an assessment of the available technologies and 
        policies to perform such remediation and any gaps that need to 
        be addressed;
            (4) the feasibility of conducting a competitive bid process 
        or prize competition to develop private sector space debris 
        remediation services that can be purchased by the United States 
        Government; and
            (5) an assessment of Federal agency roles and 
        responsibilities to provide oversight of remediation 
        activities.

SEC. 206. GAO REPORT ON INSURING NASA CLASS C AND CLASS D PAYLOADS AND

        of time that begins at the time of ignition and ends--
                    (A) at the time when the payload is deployed into 
                its intended orbit; or
                    (B) 1 year after the date on which the payload is 
                deployed into its intended orbit;
            (2) any risk such insurance will place on United States 
        taxpayers;
            (3) any effect of such insurance on launch prices; and
            (4) the feasibility of requiring launch providers to 
        include in launch bids the cost of providing first party 
        insurance of such payloads.

SEC. 305. SPACE-BASED DATA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The pace of development of new commercial space 
        technologies and markets creates a beneficial opportunity for 
        improving all space programs sponsored by the United States 
        Government.
            (2) Industry is developing smaller, more affordable 
        satellites which can be deployed in distributed constellations 
        and enables cheaper launch services.
            (3) These investments from the private sector can address 
        critical Government needs in space.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that all 
appropriate Federal agencies should explore how to take immediate 
advantage of the continued growth of space technologies, data, 
products, infrastructure, and services made available for commercial, 
market driven purposes, and should further establish programs to 
encourage the emergence of new commercial capabilities.
    (c) Treatment of Commercial Space-Based Weather Data.--Not later 
than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, and consistent 
with United States law and the National Space Policy issued June 28, 
2010, the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration shall promulgate specific rules regarding the 
Administration's treatment of weather data acquired from commercial 
space-based systems with respect to Resolution 40 of the World 
Meteorological Organization. Such rules shall--
            (1) ensure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration does not release more than the minimum amount of 
        data required under the Resolution; and
            (2) consider data release time delays, data tiers, and 
        Resolution restrictions.
    (d) Report on Earth Science Missions.--Not later than 270 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of NASA, in 
consultation with the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, shall 
submit to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a report that includes--
            (1) an evaluation of how emerging capabilities in industry 
        can provide new or alternative architectures for Federal Earth 
        science missions that routinely collect data about atmospheric, 
        oceanic, or terrestrial phenomena;
            (2) an evaluation of how emerging capabilities in industry 
        can provide new in-space platforms and services for affordable 
        in-space technology demonstration, new sensor and instrument 
        development, and other applications; and
            (3) a strategy for implementing new Federal programs that 
        leverage such commercial capabilities, products, and services 
        more rapidly and efficiently.

SEC. 307. COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING LICENSING REFORM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--The following is the sense of Congress:
            (1) The process for licensing commercial remote sensing 
        under section 60121 of title 51, United States Code, should be 
        reformed to allow license applicants to understand the 
        legitimate and identifiable technical, national security, or 
        foreign policy issues being considered and which specific 
        department or agency is considering them, in an established, 
        responsive timeline.
            (2) In order to protect United States leadership and 
        commercial viability in remote sensing technologies, the 
        Federal Government should not limit commercial entities from 
        providing remote sensing capabilities or data products that are 
        already offered or available in the international marketplace.
            (3) Before the Director of Commercial Remote Sensing 
        Regulatory Affairs denies a license application for, or places 
        any restrictions on, a remote sensing license, the Director 
        should take into account mitigation procedures that are in 
        place under law, regulation, or contract to protect national 
        security.
    (b) Deadlines for License Applications and Reviews.--Section 
60121(c) of title 51, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
    ``(c) Deadline for Action on Application.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the 
        Secretary shall review any license application and make a 
        determination thereon within 60 days of the receipt of such 
        license application.
            ``(2) First extended review period.--If the Secretary 
        determines that additional time is necessary, the Secretary may 
        extend the 60-day review period for a license application by 
        not more than 30 days.
            ``(3) Second extended review period.--The Secretary may 
        extend the extended review period for a license application 
        provided in paragraph (2) by not more than an additional 30 
        days only if the Secretary of Defense or the Director of 
        National Intelligence determines that such an extension is 
        necessary due to national security concerns. The Secretary may 
        not extend the extended review period an additional 30 days if 
        the decision for extension is not made within 3 days of the 
        expiration of the review period described in paragraph (2).''.
    (c) Rationale for Denial.--Section 60121 of title 51, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Rationale for Denial.--
            ``(1) Denial paperwork.--In any case in which the Secretary 
        denies a license under this subchapter, the Secretary shall 
        provide the applicant with a copy of the denial within 30 days 
        of the denial, which shall identify any other Federal entity 
        with which the Secretary consulted in making the decision. 
        Subject to paragraph (2), the copy of the denial shall include 
        a clearly articulated rationale for the denial.
            ``(2) Classified information.--If the rationale for a 
        denial described in paragraph (1) includes classified 
        information, the Secretary shall provide to the applicant all 
        such information for which the license applicant has the 
        required security clearance.
            ``(3) Submission to congress.--Not later than 30 days after 
        a license is denied under this subchapter, the Secretary shall 
        submit to Congress a copy of the denial and the clearly 
        articulated rationale for the denial, including all classified 
        information.''.
    (d) Retroactive Licensing Restrictions.--Commercial remote sensing 
licensing restrictions shall only be changed retroactively for national 
security issues certified by the Director of National Intelligence. 
Should a retroactive change occur, the affected actors shall be 
compensated for lost revenue from contracts signed based on services 
approved under the original license.
    (e) List of Approved Countries for Direct Downlink.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation 
        with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National 
        Intelligence, shall keep a list of nations with respect to 
        which United States commercial entities may receive expedited 
        licensing action approval to directly downlink raw remote 
        sensing data within resolution and license terms.
            (2) Considerations.--When determining the list described in 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider nations where a 
        valid export license can be obtained for space-related 
        technology.
            (3) Review.--The Secretary shall review the list described 
        in paragraph (1) once every 2 years and update as necessary.
    (f) Regulations.--
            (1) Notice of proposed rulemaking.--Not later than 3 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
        Commerce shall issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise 
        regulations contained in part 960 of title 15, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, in order to create different categories of remote 
        sensing licenses, taking into consideration the national 
        security concerns of the United States as well as--
                    (A) the type of entity applying for a license, such 
                as an academic institution or commercial entity;
                    (B) the intended purpose of the license, such as 
                conducting research or developing operational 
                constellations; and
                    (C) whether the license is intended to be used for 
                a one-time payload.
            (2) Revision of regulations.--Not later than 1 year after 
        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall revise 
        the regulations described in paragraph (1) pursuant to such 
        paragraph.

                        intends to deny a launch or reentry license 
                        application due to the nature of the deployed 
                        payload and associated activities, that--
                                    (I) shall not prejudice the 
                                Assistant Secretary in a subsequent 
                                review of the submission with remedies 
                                addressing the rationale; and
                                    (II) allows the applicant to access
