SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Each year in the United States there are an estimated 
        15,780 children between birth and the age of 19 diagnosed with 
        cancer. Approximately 1 in 285 children in the United States 
        will be diagnosed with cancer before their 20th birthday.
            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer 
        survived more than 5 years, but today, cure rates have 
        increased to over 80 percent for children and adolescents under 
        age 20.
            (3) While the cure rates for some childhood cancers are now 
        over 80 percent, the survival rates for many types of cancers 
        in children remain extremely low.
            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, cancer continues to be the leading cause of death 
        by disease in children and adolescents under the age of 14.
            (5) By 2020, the population of childhood cancers survivors 
        is expected to be 500,000 individuals.
            (6) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are 
        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, 
        with as many as one-fourth experiencing a late effect that is 
        serious or life-threatening. Common late effects of childhood 
        cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, cardiopulmonary, 
        endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects, secondary malignancies, 
        and early death.
            (7) As a result of disparities in the delivery of cancer 
        care, minority, low-income, and other medically underserved 
        children are more likely to be diagnosed with late stage 
        disease, experience poorer treatment outcomes, have shorter 
        survival time with less quality of life, and experience a 
        substantially greater likelihood of cancer death.
            (8) Collection of biospecimens, along with clinical and 
        outcome data, on children and adolescents with cancer in the 
        United States is necessary to improve childhood and adolescent 
        cancer treatments and cures. Currently biospecimens, and 
        clinical and outcome data, are collected for less than half of 
        children in the United States with cancer.
            (9) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as 
        therapies evolve, which means that the monitoring and care of 
        cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.
            (10) Despite the intense stress caused by childhood cancer, 
        there is a lack of standardized and coordinated psychosocial 
        care for the children and their families, from the date of 
        diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.
            (11) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer 
        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: 
        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized 
        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer 
        survivors is needed.
            (12) Focused and well-designed research and pilot health 
        delivery programs can answer questions about the optimal ways 
        to provide health care, follow-up monitoring services, and 
        survivorship care to those diagnosed with childhood cancer and 
        contribute to improvements in the quality of care and quality 
        of life of those individuals through adulthood.
            (13) The National Institutes of Health, including the 
        National Cancer Institute, invest approximately half of their 
        annual appropriations to support basic research that serves as 
        the foundation for translational and clinical research for all 
        diseases and conditions, with the potential to lead to 
        breakthroughs for children with cancer. Virtually all progress 
        against cancer--in both children and adults--has been founded 
        in basic research, often in areas not directly related to the 
        disease.
            (14) The National Cancer Institute supports a number of key 
        research programs specifically to advance childhood cancer 
        care, including precision medicine clinical trials for children 
        with cancer, the Children's Oncology Group (part of the 
        National Clinical Trials Network of the National Cancer 
        Institute), the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium, the 
        Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, the Childhood Cancer Survivor 
        Study, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate 
        Effective Treatments program and related pediatric cancer 
        genomics research (including the Pediatric MATCH Precision 
        Medicine trial), and the Pediatric Oncology Branch (part of the 
        intramural program of the National Cancer Institute, whose 
        mission is to develop new treatments for pediatric cancer).

SEC. 101. CHILDREN'S CANCER BIOREPOSITORIES AND BIOSPECIMEN RESEARCH.

    Section 417E of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285a-11) 
is amended--
            (1) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:
    ``(a) Children's Cancer Biorepositories.--
            ``(1) Award.--The Secretary, acting through the Director of 
        NIH, may make awards to an entity or entities described in 
        paragraph (4) to build upon existing initiatives to collect 
        biospecimens and clinical and demographic information with a 
        goal of collection for the vast majority of all children, 
        adolescents, and young adults with selected cancer subtypes 
        (and their recurrences) for which current treatments are least 
        effective, through one or more biospecimen research efforts 
        designed to achieve a better understanding of the cause of such 
        cancers (and their recurrences) and the effects of treatments 
        for such cancers.
            ``(2) Use of funds.--Amounts received under an award under 
        paragraph (1) may be used to carry out the following:

                young adults diagnosed with cancer in the United 
                States, focusing on children and adolescents enrolled 
                in clinical trials for whom current treatments are 
                least effective. Activities under this subparagraph may 
                include storage of biospecimens and associated clinical 
                and demographic data at biorepositories supported by 
                the National Cancer Institute, such as the Children's 
                Oncology Group Biorepository and the Pediatric 
                Cooperative Human Tissue Network as well as through 
                biorepositories established as appropriate to support 
                the scientific needs of future research efforts.
                    ``(B) Make such information publicly available, 
                including the repositories described in subparagraph 
                (A).
                    ``(C) Maintain a secure searchable database on

                scientists and qualified health care professionals.
                    ``(D) Establish procedures for evaluating 
                applications for access to such biospecimens and

                and clinical and demographic data from children, 
                adolescents, and young adults with cancer to 
                researchers and qualified health care professionals for 
                peer-reviewed research at a minimal cost.
            ``(3) No requirement.--No child, adolescent, or young adult 
        with cancer shall be required under this subsection to 
        contribute a specimen to a biorepository or share clinical or
