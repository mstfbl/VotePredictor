                        (xi); and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new clause:
    ``(xii) With respect to discharges occurring in cost reporting 
periods ending during or after fiscal year 2019, instead of the 
additional payment that would have been paid under this subparagraph to 
a subsection (d) hospital or a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital with 
indirect costs of medical education and notwithstanding the previous 
provisions of this subparagraph, there shall be paid to the hospital 
the payment determined under subsection (t) for such hospital and cost 
reporting period.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(t) Payment for Indirect Medical Education.--
            ``(1) In general.--
                    ``(A) Amount of payment.--For purposes of 
                subsection (d)(5)(B)(xii), the payment under this 
                subsection for a subsection (d) hospital (or a 
                subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital) for a cost 
                reporting period ending during or after fiscal year 
                2019 is the payment of an amount equal to the product 
                of--
                            ``(i) the IME pool amount computed under 
                        paragraph (2) for the fiscal year; and

                period in accordance with such timing as the Secretary 
                determines is similar to the timing of additional 
                payments that are made under subsection (h).
