                the proposed regulation that were considered, including

                Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal 
                Open Market Committee and including any modification of 
                an existing regulation, together with an explanation of 
                why the regulation meets the regulatory objectives more 
                effectively than the alternatives; and

SEC. 16. ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTENNIAL MONETARY COMMISSION.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Centennial 
Monetary Commission Act of 2015''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Constitution endows Congress with the power ``to 
        coin money, regulate the value thereof''.
            (2) Following the financial crisis known as the Panic of 
        1907, Congress established the National Monetary Commission to 
        provide recommendations for the reform of the financial and 
        monetary systems of the United States.
            (3) Incorporating several of the recommendations of the 
        National Monetary Commission, Congress created the Federal 
        Reserve System in 1913. As currently organized, the Federal 
        Reserve System consists of the Board of Governors in 
        Washington, District of Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Banks 
        organized into 12 districts around the United States. The 
        stockholders of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks include national 
        and certain State-chartered commercial banks, which operate on 
        a fractional reserve basis.
            (4) Originally, Congress gave the Federal Reserve System a 
        monetary mandate to provide an elastic currency, within the 
        context of a gold standard, in response to seasonal 
        fluctuations in the demand for currency.
            (5) Congress also gave the Federal Reserve System a 
        financial stability mandate to serve as the lender of last 
        resort to solvent but illiquid banks during a financial crisis.
            (6) In 1977, Congress changed the monetary mandate of the 
        Federal Reserve System to a dual mandate for maximum employment 
        and stable prices.
            (7) Empirical studies and historical evidence, both within 
        the United States and in other countries, demonstrate that 
        price stability is desirable because both inflation and 
        deflation damage the economy.
            (8) The economic challenge of recent years--most notably 
        the bursting of the housing bubble, the financial crisis of 
        2008, and the ensuing anemic recovery--have occurred at great 
        cost in terms of lost jobs and output.
            (9) Policymakers are reexamining the structure and 
        functioning of financial institutions and markets to determine 
        what, if any, changes need to be made to place the financial 
        system on a stronger, more sustainable path going forward.
            (10) The Federal Reserve System has taken extraordinary 
        actions in response to the recent economic challenges.
            (11) The Federal Open Market Committee has engaged in 
        multiple rounds of quantitative easing, providing unprecedented 
        liquidity to financial markets, while committing to holding 
        short-term interest rates low for a seemingly indefinite 
        period, and pursuing a policy of credit allocation by 
        purchasing Federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.
            (12) In the wake of the recent extraordinary actions of the 
        Federal Reserve System, Congress--consistent with its 
        constitutional responsibilities and as it has done periodically 
        throughout the history of the United States--has once again 
        renewed its examination of monetary policy.
            (13) Central in such examination has been a renewed look at 
        what is the most proper mandate for the Federal Reserve System 
        to conduct monetary policy in the 21st century.
    (c) Establishment of a Centennial Monetary Commission.--There is 
established a commission to be known as the ``Centennial Monetary 
Commission'' (in this section referred to as the ``Commission'').
    (d) Study and Report on Monetary Policy.--
            (1) Study.--The Commission shall--
                    (A) examine how United States monetary policy since 
                the creation of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
                Reserve System in 1913 has affected the performance of 
                the United States economy in terms of output, 
                employment, prices, and financial stability over time;
                    (B) evaluate various operational regimes under 
                which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
                System and the Federal Open Market Committee may 
                conduct monetary policy in terms achieving the maximum 
                sustainable level of output and employment and price 
                stability over the long term, including--
                            (i) discretion in determining monetary 
                        policy without an operational regime;
                            (ii) price level targeting;
                            (iii) inflation rate targeting;
                            (iv) nominal gross domestic product 
                        targeting (both level and growth rate);
                            (v) the use of monetary policy rules; and
                            (vi) the gold standard;
                    (C) evaluate the use of macro-prudential 
                supervision and regulation as a tool of monetary policy 
                in terms of achieving the maximum sustainable level of 
                output and employment and price stability over the long 
                term;
                    (D) evaluate the use of the lender-of-last-resort 
                function of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
                Reserve System as a tool of monetary policy in terms of 
                achieving the maximum sustainable level of output and 
                employment and price stability over the long term;
                    (E) recommend a course for United States monetary 
                policy going forward, including--
                            (i) the legislative mandate;
                            (ii) the operational regime;
                            (iii) the securities used in open market 
                        operations; and
                            (iv) transparency issues; and
                    (F) consider the effects of the GDP output and 
                employment targets of the ``dual mandate'' (both from 
                the creation of the dual mandate in 1977 until the 
                present time and estimates of the future effect of the 
                dual mandate ) on--
                            (i) United States economic activity;
                            (ii) Federal Reserve actions; and

            (2) Report.--Not later than December 1, 2016, the 
        Commission shall submit to Congress and make publicly available
