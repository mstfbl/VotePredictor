                such prohibited transaction under the Employee 
                Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

        the best interest standard to advice fiduciaries of iras and 
        non-erisa plans through section 4975(c)(7).--Section 4975(d) of 
        such Code is amended by deleting the language preceding 
        paragraph (1) and replacing it with the following:
    ``(d) Exemptions.--Except as provided in subsection (f)(6), the 
prohibitions provided in subsection (c)(1) shall not apply to--''.
            (3) Definition of investment advice.--Subparagraph (B) of 
        subsection 4975(e)(3) of such Code is amended to read as

                a person shall not be a fiduciary under this 
                subparagraph with respect to the terms and conditions 
                of engagement of the person, including the scope of the 
                obligation to provide advice, the products or services 
                with respect to which advice is provided and the 
                compensation payable to the person, provided the 
                recipient has consented to the terms and conditions of 
                the engagement after disclosure of all material aspects 
                of such terms and conditions, including fee disclosure 
                that satisfies subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of 
                paragraph (7)(B)(i). Except as otherwise provided in 
                subparagraph (D) and notwithstanding subparagraph (E), 
                investment advice shall include a recommendation under 
                this subparagraph provided pursuant to a written 
                acknowledgment of fiduciary status with respect to the 
                provision of such recommendation. For purposes of this 
                subparagraph, `property' means moneys and investment 
                property, and `management of securities' means 
                exercising rights or obligations with respect to 
                securities or other property,''.

        such Code is amended by striking the period at the end of 
        subparagraph (C) and inserting a comma and by adding the

                person and the party engaging the person as a fiduciary 
                to the plan. Such limitations can include limits on 
                scope, timing, and responsibility to provide ongoing 
                monitoring or advice services.

                        specific amounts of compensation described in 
                        clause (ii) or (iii) that the person will 
                        receive in connection with the particular 
                        transaction, provided that any such amounts may

                information specified in this subsection, provided that 
                the person discloses the correct information to the

                        respect to moneys, securities, or other 
                        investment property of the plan. A person shall 
                        not be considered to be providing investment 
                        advice if such recommendation is provided in 
                        conjunction with full and fair disclosure to 
                        the recipient, which can be written or verbal,

                        marketing, sales, or educational capacity, and 
                        that the person is not undertaking to provide

                        subparagraph). In addition, a person shall not 
                        be a fiduciary under this subparagraph with 
                        respect to the terms and conditions of 
                        engagement of the person, including the scope 
                        of the obligation to provide advice, the 
                        products or services with respect to which 
                        advice is provided and the compensation payable

                        (ii), and (iii) of section 408(b)(21)(C). 
                        Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph 
                        (C) and notwithstanding subparagraph (D),

                        fiduciary status with respect to the provision 
                        of such recommendation. For purposes of this 
                        clause, `property' means moneys and investment 
                        property, and `management of securities' means 
                        exercising rights or obligations with respect 
                        to securities or other property.''.

        such Act is amended by adding the following new subparagraphs 
        (C) and (D):
                    ``(C) The extent of a fiduciary's obligations as 
                such can be defined and limited pursuant to a mutual 
                agreement, arrangement, or understanding between the 
                person and the party engaging the person as a fiduciary 
                to the plan. Such limitations can include limits on 
                scope, timing, and responsibility to provide ongoing

                receive more compensation (either as a fixed dollar 
                amount or as a percentage of assets) as a result of the 
                services than the person is contractually eligible to 
                receive for such services prior to the effective date
