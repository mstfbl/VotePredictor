   To eliminate an unused lighthouse reservation, provide management 
  consistency by incorporating the rocks and small islands along the 
    coast of Orange County, California, into the California Coastal 
 National Monument managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and meet 
 the original Congressional intent of preserving Orange County's rocks

        California Coastal National Monument and shall be administered 
        as such''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``In administering 
        the lands added to the California Coastal National Monument by 
        this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall ensure that 
        economic and recreational activities conducted on such lands 
        shall continue to be allowed to the same extent to which such 
        activities were authorized and ongoing on the day before such 
        lands were added to the national monument.''.
    (b) Repeal of Reservation.--Section 31 of the Act of May 28, 1935, 
entitled ``An Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to dispose of 
certain lighthouse reservations, and for other purposes'' is hereby 
repealed.
