provide recommendations for modification, consolidation, or repeal of 
covered regulations with the aim of reducing total number of regulatory 
requirements related to workplace safety, workplace discrimination, 
wages, hours, and employee health by one-third to reduce compliance 
costs, encourage growth and innovation, and improve competitiveness--
            (1) soliciting and reviewing comments from the public;
            (2) developing a reliable and uniform model to identify 
        regulations to modify, or eliminate; and
            (3) developing a package of covered regulations to modify, 
        consolidate, or repeal to be submitted to Congress for an up-
        or-down vote.
    (b) Examination of Regulations.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date on 
        which the Commission convenes under paragraph (1), the 
        Commission shall decide which covered regulations within the 
        areas described in section 4(a) to examine.
            (2) Process for examination.--In examining covered 
        regulations under this section, the Commission shall determine 
        the effectiveness of individual covered regulations by using 
        multiple resources, including quantitative metrics, testimony 
        from industry and agency experts, and research from the staff 
        of the Commission.
            (3) Uniform model to be developed.--The Commission shall 
        develop and implement a uniform model such as the Standard Cost 
        Model to accurately determine whether a covered regulation 
        shall be modified or eliminated.
            (4) Criteria for uniform model.--The model shall balance 
        the effectiveness of the covered regulation achieving desirable 
        outcomes with the efficiency of the covered regulation in 
        achieving the aforementioned desirable outcome, consistent with 
        the following:
                    (A) Effectiveness of desired outcomes shall be 
                determined by reviewing whether the covered regulation 
                achieves the intended result, whether the covered 
                regulation will continue to achieve that result and 
                whether that desired result continues to be desirable.
                    (B) Efficiency of the desired outcomes shall be 
                determined through a uniform cost model that reviews 
                the costs per desired outcome achieved by the covered 
                regulation.
            (5) Basis for recommendations.--A covered regulation shall 
        be recommended for amendment or repeal if--
                    (A) the intended outcome is no longer desirable;
                    (B) the intended outcome would result even if the 
                covered regulation were amended or repealed;
                    (C) the covered regulation is ineffective in 
                achieving the desired outcome; or
                    (D) the costs associated with achieving the desired 
                outcome outweigh the benefit of the outcome.
            (6) No replacement of repealed regulations.--Covered 
        regulations mandated by statute but recommended for repeal by 
        the Commission shall be repealed as soon as possible and may 
        not be remade in substantially the same form, and a new 
        regulation that is substantially the same as such a regulation 
        may not be made.
            (7) Mandatory amendment of amended regulations.--Covered 
        regulations mandated by statute but recommended for amendment 
        by the Commission shall be amended as soon as possible pursuant 
        to the Commission report.

        which the Commission determines which covered regulations to 
        examine under paragraph (1), the Commission shall complete a

introduced within the 10-day period beginning on the date on which the 
President transmits the report to the Congress under section 2903(e),

            (2) the matter after the resolving clause of which is as 
        follows: ``That Congress disapproves the recommendations of the 
        Workforce Regulatory Review Commission as submitted by the

        appropriate date; and the title of which is as follows: ``Joint 
        resolution disapproving the recommendations of the Workforce 
        Regulatory Review Commission''.
    (h) Referral.--A resolution described in subsection (a) that is

Representatives. A resolution described in subsection (a) introduced in

Education, Labor, and Pensions.
    (i) Discharge.--If the committee to which a resolution described in

section 2903(e), such committee shall be, at the end of such period, 
discharged from further consideration of such resolution, and such 
resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the House 
involved.
    (j) Consideration.--
            (1) On or after the third day after the date on which the 
        committee to which such a resolution is referred has reported, 
        or has been discharged (under subsection (c)) from further 
        consideration of, such a resolution, it is in order (even 
        though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed 
        to) for any Member of the respective House to move to proceed 
        to the consideration of the resolution. A Member may make the 
        motion only on the day after the calendar day on which the 
        Member announces to the House concerned the Member's intention 
        to make the motion, except that, in the case of the House of 
        Representatives, the motion may be made without such prior 
        announcement if the motion is made by direction of the 
        committee to which the resolution was referred. The motion is 
        highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is 
        privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is 
        not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
        or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
        to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the 
        respective House shall immediately proceed to consideration of 
        the joint resolution without intervening motion, order, or 
        other business, and the resolution shall remain the unfinished 
        business of the respective House until disposed of.
            (2) Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable motions 
        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not 
        more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
        favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the 
        resolution is not in order. A motion further to limit debate is 
        in order and not debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion 
        to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion 
        to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or 
        disagreed to is not in order.
            (3) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a 
        resolution described in subsection (a) and a single quorum call 
        at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with 
        the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage 
        of the resolution shall occur.
            (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
        application of the rules of the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating 
        to a resolution described in subsection (a) shall be decided 
        without debate.
    (k) Consideration by Other House.--
            (1) If, before the passage by one House of a resolution of 
        that House described in subsection (a), that House receives 
        from the other House a resolution described in subsection (a), 
        then the following procedures shall apply:
                    (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be 
                referred to a committee and may not be considered in 
                the House receiving it except in the case of final 
                passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii).
                    (B) With respect to a resolution described in 
                subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution--
                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no resolution had been received 
                        from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                        the resolution of the other House.
            (2) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the 
        other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 
        resolution that originated in the receiving House.
    (l) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section is enacted by 
Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a resolution described in subsection 
        (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it 
        is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

                implement the commission bill within 180 days after the 
                date on which the commission bill is enacted into law.
            (2) Failure to enact commission bill.--If the commission 
        bill is not enacted into law, the President shall provide 
        notice of such failure to enact the commission bill in the 
        Federal Register.
    (n) Adjournment of Congress.--If the commission bill is introduced 
less than 60 session days or 60 legislative days before the date on
