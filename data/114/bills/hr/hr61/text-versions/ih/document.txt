                                 A BILL


 
 To preserve the access of victims of trafficking to information about 
              their eligibility to receive SNAP benefits.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing the Assistance of Victims 
of Exploitation Act of 2015 (SAVE Act)''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child 
        trafficking, has no place in a civilized society. Those who 
        engage in this illicit trade should be prosecuted to the 
        fullest extent of the law.
            (2) State and local law enforcement agencies should have 
        the tools, resources, and training necessary to identify, 
        apprehend, and prosecute criminals who ruthlessly traffic in 
        children and young persons.
            (3) One of the most effective resources in bringing 
        criminals to justice is the cooperation and assistance of their 
        victims.

SEC. 3. CONTINUATION OF SNAP INFORMATION ASSISTANCE.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the funds made 
available to carry out the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 
2011 et seq.) may be used in contravention of section 107(b) of 
Division A of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 
2000 (114 Stat. 1482; 22 U.S.C. 7105(b)).
                                 <all>
