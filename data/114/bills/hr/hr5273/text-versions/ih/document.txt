        Medicare Advantage STARS rating system before reforming such 
        system with the input of stakeholders; and

        provide for a temporary delay in authority of the Centers for 
        Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to terminate Medicare 
        Advantage plan contracts solely on the basis of performance of 
        plans under the STARS rating system.

        terminate a contract under this section with respect to the 
        offering of an MA plan by a Medicare Advantage organization

        quality rating under the 5-star rating system under section 
        1853(o)(4).''.
