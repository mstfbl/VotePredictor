                                 A BILL


 
   To empower States with authority for most taxing and spending for 
  highway programs and mass transit programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Empowerment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been 
        to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system that 
        promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all 
        States;
            (2) the objective described in paragraph (1) has been 
        attained, and the Interstate System connecting all States is 
        near completion;
            (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an 
        efficient transportation network for the residents of the 
        State;
            (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network 
        of transportation systems, including highways, that best serves 
        the needs of the State;
            (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of 
        the State and acting on those needs;
            (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over 
        time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels used 
        in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the States 
        based on the perceptions of the Federal Government on what is 
        best for the States;
            (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels 
        tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not 
        necessarily appropriate for individual States;
            (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement 
        process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive activities;
            (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, 
        regardless of the different circumstances of the States, cause 
        the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars on 
        projects, programs, and activities that the States would not 
        otherwise undertake; and
            (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing 
        the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to 
        manage its own affairs.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to provide a new policy blueprint to govern the Federal 
        role in transportation once existing and prior financial 
        obligations are met;
            (2) to return to the individual States maximum 
        discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all 
        elements of the national surface transportation systems that 
        are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;
            (3) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. 
        Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways;
            (4) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of 
        Transportation for--
                    (A) design, construction, and preservation of 
                transportation facilities on Federal public land;
                    (B) national programs of transportation research 
                and development and transportation safety; and
                    (C) emergency assistance to the States in response 
                to natural disasters;
            (5) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal 
        obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative 
        solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, 
        and preservation of Federal and State transportation 
        facilities; and
            (6) with respect to transportation activities carried out 
        by States, local governments, and the private sector, to 
        encourage--
                    (A) competition among States, local governments, 
                and the private sector; and
                    (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector 
                participation, and productivity.

SEC. 3. FUNDING LIMITATION.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary of 
Transportation determines for any of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 
that the aggregate amount required to carry out transportation programs 
and projects under this Act and amendments made by this Act exceeds the 
estimated aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for 
those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount made 
available for that program or project shall be reduced by the pro rata 
percentage required to reduce the aggregate amount required to carry 
out those programs and projects to an amount equal to that available 
for those programs and projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the 
fiscal year.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE CONTINGENT ON CERTIFICATION OF DEFICIT 
              NEUTRALITY.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to ensure that--
            (1) this Act will become effective only if the Director of 
        the Office of Management and Budget certifies that this Act is 
        deficit neutral;
            (2) discretionary spending limits are reduced to capture 
        the savings realized in devolving transportation functions to 
        the State level pursuant to this Act; and
            (3) the tax reduction made by this Act is not scored under 
        pay-as-you-go and does not inadvertently trigger a 
        sequestration.
    (b) Effective Date Contingency.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, this Act and the amendments made by this Act 
shall take effect only if--
            (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
        (referred to in this section as the ``Director'') submits the 
        report as required in subsection (c); and
            (2) the report contains a certification by the Director 
        that, based on the required estimates, the reduction in 
        discretionary outlays resulting from the reduction in contract 
        authority is at least as great as the reduction in revenues for 
        each fiscal year through fiscal year 2020.
    (c) OMB Estimates and Report.--
            (1) Requirements.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Director shall--

                from this Act for each fiscal year through fiscal year 
                2020;
                    (B) estimate the net change in discretionary 
                outlays resulting from the reduction in contract 
                authority under this Act for each fiscal year through 
                fiscal year 2020;
                    (C) determine, based on those estimates, whether 
                the reduction in discretionary outlays is at least as 
                great as the reduction in revenues for each fiscal year 
                through fiscal year 2020; and
                    (D) submit to Congress a report setting forth the 
                estimates and determination.
            (2) Applicable assumptions and guidelines.--
                    (A) Revenue estimates.--The revenue estimates 
                required under paragraph (1)(A) shall be predicated on 
                the same economic and technical assumptions and score 
                keeping guidelines that would be used for estimates 
                made pursuant to section 252(d) of the Balanced Budget 
                and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 
                902(d)).
                    (B) Outlay estimates.--The outlay estimates 
                required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined by 
                comparing the level of discretionary outlays resulting 
                from this Act with the corresponding level of 
                discretionary outlays projected in the baseline under 
                section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
                Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 907).
    (d) Conforming Adjustment to Discretionary Spending Limits.--On 
compliance with the requirements specified in subsection (b), the 
Director shall adjust the adjusted discretionary spending limits for 
each fiscal year through fiscal year 2020 under section 601(a)(2) of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 665(a)(2)) by the 
estimated reductions in discretionary outlays under subsection 
(c)(1)(B).
    (e) PAYGO Interaction.--On compliance with the requirements 
specified in subsection (b), no changes in revenues estimated to result 
from the enactment of this Act shall be counted for the purposes of 
section 252(d) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 902(d)).
