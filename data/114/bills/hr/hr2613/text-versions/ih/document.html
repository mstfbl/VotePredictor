        there were 851 accidental firearm deaths.

        almost 350,000 incidents of firearm theft from private citizens 
        occur each year.
            (7) According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 45 
        law enforcement officers were killed with their own firearm 
        between 2002 and 2011.
