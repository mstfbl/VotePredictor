                                 A BILL


 
To modify the prohibition on United States assistance and financing for 
  certain exports to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export 
            Enhancement Act of 2000, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cuba Agricultural Exports Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has a long history of providing safe 
        and reliable exports. Close proximity to Cuba further lends 
        itself to low transportation costs for United States goods 
        exported to Cuba. The United States is geographically poised to 
        be a significant trading partner in agricultural commodities. 
        United States and Cuban borders are less than 100 miles apart, 
        meaning lower shipping costs and shorter transit times compared 
        to our competitors.
            (2) Cuba imports approximately 80 percent of its food, with 
        global agricultural exports to Cuba doubling over the past 
        decade to $1.9 billion.
            (3) In 2005, the United States Department of the Treasury 
        published a final rule narrowing the definition of ``cash in 
        advance'' for trading with Cuba, requiring that cash payments 
        must be made before United States products leave United States 
        ports, rather than the more customary payment upon delivery. 
        United States firms are precluded from offering credit to 
        ALIMPORT, a state-owned and state-controlled entity that makes 
        all decisions regarding United States imports to the Cuban 
        market, resulting in declining United States agricultural 
        exports to Cuba. Notably, rice exports fell from a value of $64 
        million in 2004 to essentially $0 in 2009 and subsequent years. 
        Recent action by the Administration reverses that change to the 
        definition of cash in advance, but United States agricultural 
        exporters are still not permitted to extend credit to Cuban 
        buyers, a key disadvantage relative to other exporting nations.
            (4) Despite these restrictions, the United States has been 
        the largest exporter of agricultural goods to Cuba over the 
        last decade. However, the United States slipped to being the 
        second leading exporter of agricultural goods to Cuba in 2013 
        and the third leading exporter of agricultural goods to Cuba in 
        2014.
            (5) While trade opportunities exist, Cuba remains an 
        undemocratic autocracy that oppresses its own people and 
        restricts freedom.
            (6) In addition, there is no opportunity for United States 
        agricultural businesses to trade directly with the Cuban people 
        and there is no Cuban market. At present, there is just one 
        opportunity for United States businesses to trade with Cuba and 
        that is through ALIMPORT, the state-owned and state-controlled 
        entity described in paragraph (3).
            (7) With these cautionary factors in mind, it is important 
        to provide United States farmers and ranchers additional 
        opportunities to benefit from trade with Cuba.
