To provide for extension of agreements between the Secretary of Housing 
and Urban Development and public housing agencies participating in the 
     Moving to Work Demonstration Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Moving to Work Reform Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. TERMS OF MOVING TO WORK AGREEMENTS.

    The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not enter into 
or extend any Moving to Work agreement for any public housing agency 
for participation in the demonstration established under section 204 of 
the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, 
and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-134; 
110 Stat. 1321), unless such agreement is subject to the following 
terms and conditions for the entire duration of such agreement:
            (1) Evaluation of major policy changes.--A public housing 
        agency may not newly establish any rent policy that raises rent 
        burdens for a significant portion of participating families, 
        any time limitation on the term of housing assistance, or any 
        policy that conditions receipt of housing assistance from 
        program funds on employment status, unless--
                    (A) the policy change will be subject to a detailed 
                evaluation using a rigorous research methodology which 
                includes, at least in part, random assignment to 
                treatment and control groups to compare the impact on 
                assisted families (including families that cease to 
                receive assistance during the term of the evaluation) 
                to similar families not subject to such policy change; 
                and
                    (B) the Secretary determines that adequate Federal 
                or other resources are available to undertake the 
                required evaluation.
            (2) Use of tenant-based rental assistance funds.--A public 
        housing agency may use funds appropriated for renewal of 
        tenant-based rental assistance only for payments to or on 
        behalf of eligible families that assist such families with 
        housing costs, except that up to 10 percent of such funds may 
        be used for other eligible purposes, subject to such 
        requirements as the Secretary shall establish.
            (3) Determination of tenant-based rental assistance 
        funding.--A public housing agency shall receive funding for 
        renewal of tenant-based rental assistance determined using the 
        same formula applied to public housing agencies that do not 
        participate in the demonstration, except that up to 10 percent 
        of such funds may be renewed by adjusting the prior year's 
        funding by an inflation factor determined by the Secretary.
            (4) Prohibition of reduction in number of families 
        assisted.--A public housing agency shall provide ongoing 
        housing assistance resulting in average cost burdens no higher 
        than those of families assisted under sections 8 and 9 of the 
        United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f, 1437g) to 
        substantially the same number of eligible low-income families 
        as the agency could assist if it expended the full amount of 
        funding it receives under such sections 8 and 9 pursuant to the 
        requirements of such sections.
            (5) Housing choice.--If the Secretary determines that a 
        disproportionately low share of families assisted by a public 
        housing agency using funds appropriated pursuant to sections 8 
        and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 lives in 
        neighborhoods with low crime, high-performing schools, or other 
        indicators of high opportunity, the public housing agency shall 
        develop and implement a plan to expand families' access to such 
        neighborhoods.
            (6) Determination of public housing operating funding.--A 
        public housing agency shall receive funding for operation and 
        management of public housing determined using the same formula 
        applied to public housing agencies that do not participate in 
        the demonstration, except that, for an agency that currently 
        receives such funding under an alternative formula established 
        by its Moving to Work agreement, the Secretary shall phase in 
        the requirements of this paragraph in a manner sufficient so as 
        to avoid reducing funding by more than 10 percent per year.
            (7) Retained provisions.--The Secretary shall not waive any 
        of the following provisions of the United States Housing Act of 
        1937:

                        date of the enactment of this Act, is using or

                        of the 20-percent cap may continue to use such 
                        funds in excess of such cap, but not in excess

SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF DEMONSTRATION.

    The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall conduct a 
comprehensive evaluation of the Moving to Work demonstration and, upon 
completion of the evaluation, submit to the Congress a report--
            (1) describing and analyzing the risks and potential 
        benefits of expanding the Moving to Work demonstration program 
        to additional agencies compared to those of maintaining the 
        demonstration program at its current size; and
            (2) identifying reforms, and selection criteria in case the 
        demonstration program is expanded, that would improve the 
        program's effectiveness in testing innovative policies while 
        minimizing adverse effects on low-income families and ensuring 
        efficient use of Federal funds to meet the most pressing 
        housing needs.
                                 <all>
