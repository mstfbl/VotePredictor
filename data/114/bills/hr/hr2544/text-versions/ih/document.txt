            (2) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:
    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Depleted uranium.--The term `depleted uranium' means 
        uranium having an assay less than the assay for--
                    ``(A) natural uranium; or
                    ``(B) 0.711 percent of the uranium-235 isotope.
            ``(2) Highly enriched uranium.--The term `highly enriched 
        uranium' means uranium having an assay of 20 percent or greater 
        of the uranium-235 isotope.
            ``(3) Low-enriched uranium.--The term `low-enriched 
        uranium' means uranium having an assay greater than 0.711 
        percent but less than 20 percent of the uranium-235 isotope.
            ``(4) Metric ton of uranium.--The term `metric ton of 
        uranium' means 1,000 kilograms of uranium.
            ``(5) Natural uranium.--The term `natural uranium' means 
        uranium having an assay of 0.711 percent of the uranium-235 
        isotope.
            ``(6) Off-spec uranium.--The term `off-spec uranium' means 
        uranium in any form, including depleted uranium, highly 
        enriched uranium, low-enriched uranium, natural uranium, UF6, 
        and any byproduct of uranium processing, that does not meet the 
        specification for commercial material (as defined by the 
        standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials).
            ``(7) Uranium.--Other than in subsection (c), the term 
        `uranium' includes natural uranium, uranium hexafluoride, 
        highly enriched uranium, low-enriched uranium, depleted 
        uranium, and any byproduct of uranium processing.
            ``(8) Uranium hexafluoride; uf6.--The terms `uranium 
        hexafluoride' and `UF6' mean uranium that has been combined 
        with fluorine, to form a compound that, dependent on 
        temperature and pressure, can be a solid, liquid, or gas.
    ``(b) Transfers and Sales by the Secretary.--The Secretary shall 
not provide enrichment services, or transfer, sell or otherwise provide 
any uranium to any person except in accordance with this section.
    ``(c) Development of Federal Excess Uranium Management Plan.--
            ``(1) In general.--Beginning on January 1, 2017, and not 
        less frequently than once every 10 years thereafter, the 
        Secretary shall issue a long-term Federal excess uranium 
        inventory management plan (referred to in this section as the 
        `plan') that details the management of the excess uranium 
        inventories of the Department of Energy and covers a period of 
        not fewer than 10 years.
            ``(2) Content.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The plan shall cover all forms

                uranium, off-spec uranium, and UF6.
                    ``(B) Reducing impact on domestic industry.--The 
                plan shall outline steps the Secretary will take to 
                minimize the impact of transferring, selling, or

                mining, conversion, and enrichment industries, 
                including any actions for which the Secretary would 
                require new authority.
