   To provide for research and the testing of innovative health care 
    delivery models to improve medication adherence, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Synchronization & Nonadherence 
Correction (SYNC) Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Between one-half and two-thirds of patients with 
        chronic diseases in the United States do not take medications 
        as prescribed.
            (2) Low rates of medication adherence result in higher 
        health care costs, reduced effectiveness of health care 
        treatments and regimens, negative health effects for patients, 
        and tens of thousands of deaths on an annual basis.
            (3) Medication adherence may be lowest among patients with 
        chronic diseases.
            (4) Improving medication adherence would reduce unnecessary 
        hospital admissions and emergency room visits.
            (5) Nonadherence is estimated to cost the United States 
        health care system over $100,000,000,000 each year.
            (6) Improving medication adherence could improve patient 
        health outcomes, reduce health care costs, and lead to 
        productivity gains.

            (1) The term ``applicable individual'' means an applicable 
        individual (as defined in section 1115A(a)(4)(A) of the Social

SEC. 4. NATIONAL RESEARCH AND REPORTING STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED 
              MEDICATION ADHERENCE.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services 
Administration, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in

decisionmakers regarding medication adherence and medication 
persistence, and methods to improve medication adherence and 
persistence in Federal health programs.
    (b) Activities Included.--The activities described in subsection 
(a) shall include development of annual statistics on recommended 
medications, the rate of medication adherence, the rate of primary 
nonadherence, and the rate of medication persistence for patients with 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, 
diabetes, autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), and mental health conditions treated under the following health 
care programs:
            (1) Medicare.--The Medicare program under title XVIII of 
        the Social Security Act.

this Act (and annually thereafter), the Secretary shall submit to 
Congress a report on the statistics collected under subsection (a), 
together with recommendations for such legislation and administrative 
action to address problems and improve medication adherence and 
medication persistence as the Secretary determines appropriate.

SEC. 5. TESTING MODELS FOR IMPROVING MEDICATION ADHERENCE.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall test innovative health care 
delivery models, as described in subsections (b) and (c), to improve 
medication adherence and medication persistence, with the goal of 
improving health outcomes and decreasing health costs for chronic care 
conditions.
    (b) Models To Test Efficacy of Synchronization.--
            (1) In general.--The model described in this subsection 
        shall test the efficacy of synchronization of prescription drug 
        medications for applicable enrollees in improving medication 
        adherence, determining cost avoidance, and improving outcomes 
        for those enrollees.
            (2) Participation.--An applicable enrollee who is eligible 
        to participate in the model testing under this subsection shall 
        participate in the model testing, unless the enrollee elects 
        not to participate in the model.
            (3) Models tested.--The following models of synchronization 
        shall be tested under this subsection:
                    (A) Model 1.--Synchronization (synchronization of 
                prescription drug medications and medication 
                reconciliation phone calls or electronic communication

                    (C) Model 3.--Synchronization (as described in 
                subparagraph (A)) and ongoing pharmacist counseling 
                that shall occur at the patient's request and include 
                review of the appropriateness of the medication regimen 
                and any barriers to medication adherence.
            (4) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall evaluate the models in 
        paragraph (3) by collecting and analyzing relevant plan and 
        enrollee data, including at least the following:
                    (A) Synchronization enrollment and drop-out rates.
                    (B) Primary medication nonadherence.

                            (i) eligible for benefits under a State 
                        plan under title XIX of the Social Security; or
                            (ii) eligible for premium and cost-sharing 
                        subsidies under section 1860D-14(a) of the 
                        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-114(a)).
                    (G) Prescription drug claims data in comparison to 
                other medical claims data for applicable enrollees in 
                order to examine the effect of synchronization and 
                adherence on overall health spending, including health 
                care costs avoided, and patient outcomes.
    (c) Testing 90-Day Fills at Retail Pharmacies for the First 
Prescription.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a 
        demonstration that compares the use of 90-day first fills of 
        prescriptions at retail pharmacies or using mail-order for 
        maintenance medications against 30-day first fills for 
        applicable enrollees under part D of title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act, to determine whether there is an impact on 
        medication persistence, cost avoidance, and improving outcomes 
        for those enrollees in subsequent refill periods.
            (2) Drugs tested.--The model under this subsection shall 
        only pertain to first fills for maintenance drugs treating 
        chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension,

        disease (COPD), and mental health conditions.
            (3) Evaluation of demonstration by gao.--
                    (A) Provision of data for evaluation.--The 
                Secretary shall make available to the Comptroller

                (B).
                    (B) Evaluation.--Using data made available under

                Comptroller General of the United States shall evaluate 
                the demonstration conducted under this subsection. Such 
                evaluation shall examine the effect of long-term fills 
                and adherence on overall health spending, including 
                health care costs avoided, and patient outcome, and 
                shall examine at least the following in relation to 
                part D enrollees using 90-day first fills in comparison 
                with those enrollees using 30-day first fills:
