                                 A BILL


 
To amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to provide for 
enhanced payments to rural health care providers under the Medicare and 
               Medicaid programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Save Rural 
Hospitals Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 60,000,000 individuals in rural areas of the 
        United States rely on rural hospitals and other providers as 
        critical access points to health care.
            (2) Access to health care is essential to communities that 
        Americans living in rural areas call home.
            (3) Americans living in rural areas are older, poorer, and 
        sicker than Americans living in urban areas.
            (4) From January 2010 until July 8, 2015, 55 rural 
        hospitals have closed in the United States, according to the 
        University of North Carolina's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health 
        Services Research, and the rate of these closures is 
        increasing.
            (5) Two hundred and eighty-three hospitals are at risk of 
        closing, according to iVantage's Hospital Strength INDEX study, 
        and such closings would mean that 700,000 patients would be 
        left without local access to care, 50,000 community jobs would 
        be lost, 36,000 healthcare jobs would be lost, and 
        $10,600,000,000 would be lost from the gross domestic product.
            (6) Rural Medicare beneficiaries already face a number of 
        challenges when trying to access health care services close to 
        home, including the weather, geography, and cultural, social, 
        and language barriers.
            (7) Seventy-seven percent of rural counties in the United 
        States are designated as primary care health professional 
        shortage areas while 9 percent have no physicians at all.
            (8) Seniors living in rural areas are forced to travel 
        significant distances for care.
            (9) On average, trauma victims in rural areas must travel 
        twice as far as victims in urban areas to the closest hospital, 
        and, as a result, 60 percent of trauma deaths occur in rural 
        areas, even though only 20 percent of Americans live in rural 
        areas.
            (10) With the 283 hospitals on the brink of closure, 
        700,000 Americans living in rural areas are on the brink of 
        losing access to the closest emergency room.

        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirement imposed by the amendment made by 
        this section, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing

        the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the 
        close of the first regular session of the State legislature 
        that begins after the date of the enactment of this Act. For 
        purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that 
        has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session
