    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall enter into an arrangement with 
the National Academies for a comprehensive research survey and strategy 
for FAA's civil aviation activities, including NextGen, over the next 
decade. The survey shall encompass research activities in FAA's 
Research, Engineering, and Development, Facilities and Equipment, and 
Grants-in-Aid for Airports accounts, as well as any other research or 
emerging research areas that will enhance FAA's civil aviation 
activities. The survey shall--
            (1) prioritize FAA civil aviation research needs and align 
        such research needs with the mission of FAA;
            (2) examine the status of research methods and tools, 
        including modeling and simulation, data analysis, and 
        technology demonstration capabilities, that can contribute to 
        FAA civil aviation research;
            (3) examine the status of FAA-owned research facilities and 
        equipment, the extent to which their availability and 
        accessibility is coordinated across FAA's research programs, 
        and their ability to support FAA civil aviation research over 
        the next decade;
            (4) identify workforce skills, workforce development, and 
        training needed to support research priorities over the next 
        decade;

        research advances into operational use, including the process 
        required for the certification, operational approval, and 
        implementation of new technologies and resulting operations 
        into the National Airspace System, and identify the best 
        practices used by other United States or non-United States 
        organizations in transitioning such research into operations;
            (6) examine issues related to the dissemination of relevant 
        research to the broader aviation community;

        nongovernment entities to civil aviation; and
            (8) make prioritized recommendations on the areas described 
        in paragraphs (1) through (7).
    (b) Transmittal.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit the results of the 
National Academies decadal survey to the Committee on Science, Space,

Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.

SEC. 22. 5-YEAR STRATEGIC AND INTEGRATED RESEARCH PLAN.

    (a) Plan.--Not later than 9 months after the date of transmittal of 
the decadal survey under section 21(b), the Secretary shall transmit to 
the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a Strategic and Integrated Research Plan 
that establishes a program of research and development activities that 
reflects the results of such decadal survey. The plan shall--
            (1) describe how FAA's research and development activities 
        and associated projects, including those related to--
                    (A) NextGen-associated research;
                    (B) research, engineering, and development and 
                facilities and equipment;
                    (C) grants-in-aid for airports research; and
                    (D) other research areas recommended in the decadal 
                survey,
        will be interlinked to address common themes and contribute to 
        making progress on the priorities identified in the decadal 
        survey transmitted under section 21(b);
            (2) provide integrated research objectives, milestones, and 
        timelines for achieving those priorities over the next 5 years; 
        and
            (3) describe research activities that will lead to 
        procedures for the certification and operational approval of 
        new technologies for their timely and cost-effective 
        introduction into the National Airspace System.
    (b) Review.--Not later than 3 years after the transmittal of the 
Strategic and Integrated Research Plan under subsection (a), the 
Secretary shall enter into an arrangement with the National Academies 
to review FAA's progress on implementing the Strategic and Integrated 
Research Plan.
    (c) Transmittal of Review.--Not later than 12 months after the 
Secretary enters into the arrangement required under subsection (b), 
the Secretary shall transmit the results of the National Academies' 
review to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate.

SEC. 23. CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH ACTION INITIATIVE.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall ensure that FAA's research and 
development on cybersecurity and its application across FAA is dynamic 
and constantly updated to reflect the evolving nature of cyber risks 
and threats, and that cybersecurity research and development is 
approached in an integrated fashion consistent with the findings and 
analyses of both the Government Accountability Office and the National 
Academies report, ``A Review of the Next Generation Air Transportation 
System: Implications and Importance of a System Architecture'', which 
states that ``Cybersecurity requires a system-wide approach that is 
managed architecturally and cannot be addressed piecemeal by each 
contractor (or program) separately. Nor can security be added to the 
system later. Safety properties themselves are dependent on a 
resilient, trustworthy, secure system, so careful integration of 
cybersecurity models and processes into safety analyses will become 
increasingly important. Finally, cybersecurity itself is an ongoing 
challenge in many domains and the subject of ongoing research; it will 
be important to track and integrate relevant results as the field 
continues to evolve.''. Development of an agencywide threat model will 
facilitate FAA in taking an integrated approach to cybersecurity.
    (b) Threat Model Development.--The Secretary shall develop an 
agencywide threat model to strengthen cybersecurity defense across FAA. 
The threat model shall--
            (1) be continuously updated;
            (2) be capable of describing the landscape of security 
        risks to FAA's operational systems, including those potentially 
        caused by manned and unmanned aircraft operation in the 
        National Airspace System; and
            (3) enable FAA to--
                    (A) identify known threats, including insider 
                threats;
                    (B) align cybersecurity efforts and responses 
                commensurate with the identified threats; and
                    (C) implement any additional actions needed to 
                respond to threats and security weaknesses that have 
                not been addressed.
    (c) Transmittal.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit a classified threat 
model and an unclassified executive summary to the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate.
