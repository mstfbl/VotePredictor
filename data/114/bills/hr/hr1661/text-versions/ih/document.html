                        such mutual depository;
                            ``(ii) is unsecured by the assets of such 
                        mutual depository;
                            ``(iii) does not permit preemptive rights;

                        rights to the holder unless the board of 
                        directors of such mutual depository proposes to 
                        change the specific terms of any class of such 
                        certificates in a manner adverse to the 
                        interests of the holder;
                            ``(v) is not eligible for use as collateral 
                        for any loan made by such mutual depository;
                            ``(vi) if declared by the board of 
                        directors of such mutual depository, entitles 
                        the holder to a payment of fixed, variable, or 
                        participating dividends; and

                        consolidation of such mutual depository, or 
                        reorganization of such mutual depository into a 
                        mutual holding company or a Federal mutual bank 
                        holding company (as such term is defined in 
                        section 5133A(a) of the Revised Statutes of the 
                        United States).

                provided for under State law, the deposits of which are 
                insured by an instrumentality of the Federal 
                Government.''; and
            (2) in subsection (c)(1)--

                certificates that shall qualify as common equity Tier 1 
                capital (as such term is defined by the appropriate 
                Federal banking agency) for purposes of any capital 
                requirements mandated by any Federal law or 
                regulation.''.
