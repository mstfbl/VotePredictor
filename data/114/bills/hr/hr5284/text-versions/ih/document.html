                monthly premiums for coverage of under the plan of 20 
                percent of the monthly premium otherwise determined for 
                each consecutive full 12-month period (ending before

                enroll in creditable coverage and maintain continuous 
                creditable coverage. The Secretary shall approve such 
                waiver if the Secretary determines that the alternative 
                provisions provide similar or greater incentives for 
                such enrollment than the incentives otherwise 
                applicable.

        Secretary, take such steps, such as limiting the availability 
        of general open enrollment periods, imposing delays in the 
        effectiveness for coverage, permitting differentials in 
        premiums based on age and other factors, as the State 
        determines necessary in order to ensure an orderly market for 
        health insurance coverage in the State that is not offered 
        through an Exchange. Such steps may include the establishment 
        of such initial open enrollment period during which qualified 
        residents may enroll in health insurance coverage without the 
        imposition of any underwriting as the State determines to be 
        appropriate in ensuring initial access to such coverage.
            (2) Flexibility in imposing additional requirements.--
        Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a 
        State from continuing to apply, to health insurance coverage 
        issued in the State, requirements under the provisions of title 
        XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (as amended by subtitles 
        A and C of title I of PPACA) that are not continued under 
        subsection (a).
            (3) State flexibility with respect to exchanges.--A State 
        may waive such provisions of part II of subtitle D of title I 
        of PPACA, in relation to the establishment of an Exchange in 
        such State, as the State determines appropriate in order for 
        the State to implement and administer a market-based system for 
        the availability of health insurance coverage throughout the 
        State.
            (4) State default enrollment option.--
                    (A) Enrollment, subject to individual opt-out.--
                Subject to subparagraph (D), a State may elect to 
                provide for the enrollment of residents of the State 
                who are uninsured in default health insurance coverage 
                (as defined in subparagraph (B)) and establishing a 
                Roth HSA for such residents who do not have a Roth HSA 
                unless the resident has affirmatively elected not to be 
                so enrolled and not to have such an account. 
                respectively. If a State makes such an election, the 
                State shall permit eligible residents to enroll in such 
                coverage on a continuous basis.
                    (B) Default health insurance coverage defined.--In 
                this paragraph, the term ``default health insurance 
                coverage'' means, with respect to a State, health 
                insurance coverage that--
                            (i) is a high deductible health plan 
                        (within the meaning of section 223(c)(2) of the 
                        Internal Revenue Code of 1986) with 
                        prescription drug coverage limited to generic 
                        drugs for a limited number of chronic 
                        conditions (commonly referred to as tier I 
                        pharmacy benefit);
                            (ii) meets such requirements as may apply 
                        to qualify for the payment of plan premiums 
                        from a health savings account under section 223 
                        of such Code (such as age-related premiums and 
                        limitation on imposition of preexisting 
                        condition exclusions);
                            (iii) has a provider network for covered 
                        benefits that is adequate (as determined 
                        consistent with guidelines issued by the 
                        Secretary) to ensure access to health benefits 
                        under such plan;
                            (iv) provides for coverage of childhood 
                        immunizations without cost sharing requirements 
                        to the extent such immunizations have in effect 
                        a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on 
                        Immunization Practices of the Centers for 
                        Disease Control and Prevention with respect to 
                        the individual involved; and
                            (v) meets such other requirements as the 
                        State may specify.
                    (C) Roth hsa.--In this paragraph, the term ``Roth 
                HSA'' shall have the meaning given such term by section 
                530A(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
                    (D) Simple process for individuals to opt-out.--As 
                a condition of a State providing for the enrollment 
                function described in subparagraph (A), the State must 
                establish an easy-to-use and transparent means by which 
                individuals may elect not to be enrolled in default 
                health insurance coverage or to have a Roth HSA 
                established on the individual's behalf, or both.
    (c) Inapplicability of Required Essential Health Benefits.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, no health benefits plan shall be required by reason of 
        Federal law to comply with the requirements of sections 
        1301(a)(1)(B) and 1302 of PPACA (42 U.S.C. 18021(a)(1)(B), 
        18022).
            (2) State flexibility.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed as preventing a State from applying, at its option 
        with respect to health insurance coverage offered through an 
        Exchange or otherwise in the State, the requirements referred 
        to in paragraph (1).
    (d) Effective Date; Transition.--
            (1) In general.--Subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall apply 
        to plan years beginning after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
            (2) Sunsetting required contribution for aca reinsurance 
        program.--No contribution shall be required under section 1341 
        of PPACA (42 U.S.C. 18061) from any group health plan or health 
        insurance issuer for portions of plans years occurring in 
        months beginning more than 30 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.
    (e) Secretarial Guidance.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, in coordination with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary 
of the Treasury, shall provide such guidance as may be necessary for 
the coordinated implementation of this section on a timely basis.
    (f) Transferring Health Plan Records Upon Changing Plans.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of an individual who is 
        covered under health insurance coverage or as a beneficiary or 
        participant in a group health plan (as such terms are defined 
        in section 2791 of the Public Health Service Act), if such 
        coverage is ended and the individual obtains other health 
        insurance coverage, group health plan coverage, or other 
        creditable coverage (as defined for purposes of title XXVII of 
        such Act), the issuer of the prior coverage or administrator of 
        the prior plan shall forward information respecting such prior 
        coverage to the issuer of the new coverage or administrator of 
        the new plan or coverage, as the case may be, subject to such 
        rules as the Secretary establishes regarding the right of the 
        beneficiary or participant to object to such forwarding of 
        information.
            (2) Treatment as plan requirement under phsa, erisa, irc.--
        The requirement of paragraph (1) shall apply as if it were a 
        section under part A of title XXVII of the Public Health 
        Service Act, including for purposes of applying section 715 of 
        the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1976 (29 U.S.C. 
        1185d) and section 9815 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (g) Application of Risk Adjustment.--
            (1) In general.--Any issuer that offers health insurance 
        coverage in the individual market in any of the 50 States or 
        the District of Columbia shall participate in a risk adjustment 
        mechanism under this subsection with respect to any health 
        insurance coverage it so offers in such market, whether or not 
        such coverage is offered through an Exchange.
            (2) Form and design of risk adjustment mechanism.--The 
        Secretary shall, in consultation with the National Association 
        of Insurance Commissioners and other interested parties, 
        develop a mechanism to permit the adjustment of risk among 
        health insurance coverage offered in the individual market 
        throughout the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Such 
        mechanism shall be designed to effect the same type of risk 
        adjustment among such coverage that is applicable to risk 
        adjustment of payments among Medicare Advantage organizations 
        under part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act.
            (3) Transition for new coverage.--The mechanism developed 
        under paragraph (2) shall provide for transitional protection, 
        over a 3-year period, in the case of health insurance coverage 
        that has not been previously marketed.
            (4) Development of further risk adjustment mechanism.--The 
        Secretary shall request the National Association of Insurance 
        Commissioners to develop a permanent model for adjustment of 
        risk among health insurance issuers with respect to health 
        insurance coverage offered in the individual market, with the 
        intention that such a model would substitute for the mechanism 
        developed under paragraph (2).
            (5) Treatment as plan requirement under phsa, erisa, irc.--
        The requirement of paragraph (1) shall apply as if it were a 
        section under part A of title XXVII of the Public Health 
        Service Act, including for purposes of applying section 715 of 
        the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1976 (29 U.S.C. 
        1185d) and section 9815 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

SEC. 122. OFFERING OF BASIC HEALTH INSURANCE; PROTECTION OF ASSETS FROM 
              LIABILITY OR ATTACHMENT OR SEIZURE.

    (a) Requirement for Exchanges.--
            (1) In general.--No tax credit shall be allowable under 
        section 36B or 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for 
        residents of a State unless any Exchange established in the 
        State provides for the offering of basic health insurance in 
        all areas of the State.
            (2) Basic health insurance defined.--In this subsection, 
        the term ``basic health insurance'' means, with respect to a 
        State, such health insurance coverage as the State may specify 
        and includes limited benefit insurance (as defined in 
        subsection (b)).
    (b) Limited Benefit Insurance Defined.--
            (1) In general.--In this title, the term ``limited benefit 
        insurance'' means individual health insurance coverage that, 
        with respect to a plan year, imposes (consistent with paragraph 
        (2)) an annual limit on the amounts that may be payable under 
        the coverage with respect to expenses incurred for items and 
        services furnished in that plan year.
            (2) Specification of annual limit; variation in limit for 
        individual and family coverage.--The Secretary shall specify, 
        from year to year, the annual limit (or range of annual limits) 
        that may be applied under paragraph (1). Such a limit may 
        distinguish between coverage that is only provided for an 
        individual and coverage that is provided also for family 
        members of the individual.
    (c) Protection of Certain Assets in Case of Individuals Covered 
Under Limited Benefit Insurance.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, if an individual is covered under limited benefit 
        insurance for a plan year and benefits under such insurance 
        have reached the annual limit under such insurance for items 
        and services furnished in the plan year, the individual is not 
        liable for debt incurred and arising from the provision of 
        subsequently furnished items and services during the plan year, 
        regardless of whether benefits are otherwise covered for such 
        items and services under such policy, insofar as the liability 
        attributable to such items and services exceeds--
                    (A) the bankruptcy valuation of the individual's 
                property at the time the debt is incurred; reduced by
                    (B) such annual limit of benefits under the limited 
                benefit insurance for the plan year.
        Property in the amount so protected from liability shall be 
        exempt and immune from attachment or seizure with respect to 
        any judgment related to such debt.
            (2) Bankruptcy valuation defined.--In this subsection, the 
        term ``bankruptcy valuation'' means, with respect to property 
        of an individual as of a date, the value of the property as of 
        such date as determined as if the individual were a debtor in a 
        bankruptcy case that could have been filed under title 11 of 
        the United States Code and the property could not be exempt 
        under section 522 of such title.
            (3) No requirement for providers to furnish subsequent 
        services without ensuring payment.--Except as may be explicitly 
        provided in other law (such as under section 1867 of the Social 
        Security Act, popularly known as EMTALA), a health care 
        provider is not required to furnish any items or services to an 
        individual who has exhausted benefits under limited benefit 
        insurance for a plan year without the individual (or another 
        person on the individual's behalf) providing for such advance 
        or guarantee of payment for such items and services as may be 
        arranged between the health care provider and the individual.

                any subsequent month during the taxable year for 
                purposes of determining the limitation under 
                subparagraph (A).
            ``(4) Adjustment for limited benefit insurance.--In the 
        case of a taxpayer whose only health insurance coverage for a 
        month is limited benefit insurance (as defined in section 
        123(b) of the World's Greatest Healthcare Plan Act of 2016), 
        the amount determined under paragraph (2) shall be decreased by 
        such proportion as the Secretary, in consultation with the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services, determines appropriate,

        taxpayer or other covered individual of an age and residing in 
        an area, the ratio of the average cost of typical individual

        36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that would have been 
        allowed for the year for qualified residents of the State for 
        taxable years ending in the year if all eligible qualified 
        residents had qualified for such credits;
            (2) the aggregate amount of credits under such section that 
        were allowed for taxable years ending in that the year by 
        qualified residents of such State; and
            (3) 25 percent of the amount by which--
                    (A) the amount determined under paragraph (1) with 
                respect to qualified residents of the State for such 
                year; exceeds
                    (B) the amount determined under paragraph (2) for 
                such State for that year.
    (b) Appropriation.--For the purpose of making grants to States 
under this section, there is hereby appropriated to the Secretary, out 
of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for each year 
(beginning with 2017) an amount equivalent to the amount determined 
under subsection (a)(3) for all States under subsection (a) for the 
year in which such fiscal year ends, subject to adjustment under 
subsection (d)(2).
    (c) Grants to States for Indigent Assistance.--
            (1) Application.--A State may file with the Secretary (in a 
        form and manner specified by the Secretary) an application to 
        provide assistance in furnishing health services to indigent 
        individuals residing in the State. Such application shall 
        demonstrate the manner in which such assistance is furnished in 
        an equitable manner to individuals residing in all parts of the 
        State.
            (2) Amount of funds.--From the funds appropriated under 
        subsection (b) for a year, the amount of funds paid to any 
        State in any year under this section with an application filed 
        in accordance with paragraph (1) is equal to an amount 
        specified in the application, but not to exceed the amount 
        computed under subsection (a)(3) for the State and the year.
            (3) Use of funds.--Funds paid to a State under this 
        subsection may be used only to assist in the furnishing of 
        health services to uninsured individuals residing in the State 
        or for purposes of increasing the payment adjustments made 
        under sections 1886(d)(5)(F) and 1923 of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(F), 1396r-4) to hospitals that 
        serve a disproportionate share of such individuals in the 
        State.
    (d) Initial Estimate; Final Calculation and Reconciliation.--
            (1) Use of estimates.--The calculations under subsection 
        (a) for a year shall initially be estimated before the 
        beginning of the year. Payments under this section to a State 
        for a year shall be made, subject to reconciliation under 
        paragraph (2), based on the amount so estimated.
            (2) Reconciliation based on final calculation.--The 
        calculations under subsection (a) for a year shall also be made 
        after the end of the year. Insofar as the amount calculated 
        under this paragraph for subsection (a)(3) for a State for a

SEC. 133. MEDICAID OPTION OF ENROLLMENT UNDER PRIVATE PLAN AND 
              CONTRIBUTION TO AN HSA.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a 
State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 
et seq.) may make available to an individual, who is entitled to 
medical assistance for a full range of acute care items and services 
under such title and at the individual's option, instead of the medical 
assistance otherwise provided, medical assistance consisting of 
coverage under a health plan that qualifies for a tax credit under 
section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, but only if the State 
provides for the individual medical assistance, in the form of a 
deposit into a health savings account for the individual, an amount 
equivalent to the amount by which the amount of tax credit for the 
individual under such section exceeds the cost of coverage of the 
individual under the plan.
    (b) FFP Treatment.--The payments by a State described in subsection 
(a) for coverage under a health plan and for deposit into a health 
savings account shall be treated as medical assistance for purposes of 
section 1903 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b) and subject 
to Federal financial participating, including the application of State 
matching payments, in the same manner as other medical assistance 
furnished under title XIX of such Act, except that such amount shall be 
reduced by the amount of any health insurance credits provided under 
section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to such 
coverage or deposit.

may instruct the Secretary of the Treasury that payments made to such 
provider shall be not treated, for purposes of section 223 of the

        any condition of such licensure or certification.
            (2) Standard.--The Secretary may grant a waiver submitted 
        under paragraph (1) if the Secretary determines such waiver 
        would--
                    (A) increase competition within the health care 
                market;
                    (B) reduce the costs of health care; and

        granted a waiver under paragraph (2), any requirement with 
        respect to which such waiver is granted is preempted to the 
        extent specified in such waiver.
