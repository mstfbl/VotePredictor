                a political committee of a political party) for a 
                coordinated expenditure (as such term is defined in 
                section 324) which is not otherwise treated as a 
                contribution under clause (i) or clause (ii).''.

            ``(2) Exception for payments for certain communications.--A 
        payment for a communication (including a covered communication 
        described in subsection (d) shall not be treated as a 
        coordinated expenditure under this subsection if--
                    ``(A) the communication appears in a news story, 
                commentary, or editorial distributed through the 
                facilities of any broadcasting station, newspaper, 
                magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such 
                facilities are owned or controlled by any political 
                party, political committee, or candidate; or
                    ``(B) the communication constitutes a candidate

                adopted by the Commission pursuant to section 
                304(f)(3)(B)(iii), or which solely promotes such a 
                debate or forum and is made by or on behalf of the 
                person sponsoring the debate or forum.
    ``(b) Coordination Described.--

        is made `in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at 
        the request or suggestion of,' a candidate, an authorized 
        committee of a candidate, a political committee of a political 
        party, or agents of the candidate or committee, if the payment, 
        or any communication for which the payment is made, is not made 
        entirely independently of the candidate, committee, or agents. 
        For purposes of the previous sentence, a payment or 
        communication not made entirely independently of the candidate 
        or committee includes any payment or communication made 
        pursuant to any general or particular understanding with, or 
        pursuant to any communication with, the candidate, committee, 
        or agents about the payment or communication.
            ``(2) No finding of coordination based solely on sharing of 
        information regarding legislative or policy position.--For 
        purposes of this section, a payment shall not be considered to 
        be made by a person in cooperation, consultation, or concert 
        with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate or 
        committee, solely on the grounds that the person or the 
        person's agent engaged in discussions with the candidate or 
        committee, or with any agent of the candidate or committee, 
        regarding that person's position on a legislative or policy 
        matter (including urging the candidate or committee to adopt 
        that person's position), so long as there is no communication 
        between the person and the candidate or committee, or any agent 
        of the candidate or committee, regarding the candidate's or 
        committee's campaign advertising, message, strategy, policy, 
        polling, allocation of resources, fundraising, or other 
        campaign activities.
            ``(3) No effect on party coordination standard.--Nothing in 
        this section shall be construed to affect the determination of 
        coordination between a candidate and a political committee of a 
        political party for purposes of section 315(d).
            ``(4) No safe harbor for use of firewall.--A person shall 
        be determined to have made a payment in cooperation, 
        consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion 
        of, a candidate or committee, in accordance with this section 
        without regard to whether or not the person established and 
        used a firewall or similar procedures to restrict the sharing 
        of information between individuals who are employed by or who 
        are serving as agents for the person making the payment.
    ``(c) Payments by Coordinated Spenders for Covered 
Communications.--
            ``(1) Payments made in cooperation, consultation, or 
        concert with candidates.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A), 
        if the person who makes a payment for a covered communication, 
        as defined in subsection (d), is a coordinated spender under 
        paragraph (2) with respect to the candidate as described in 
        subsection (d)(1), the payment for the covered communication is 
        made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with the 
        candidate.
            ``(2) Coordinated spender defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `coordinated spender' means, with respect 
        to a candidate or an authorized committee of a candidate, a 
        person (other than a political committee of a political party) 
        for which any of the following applies:
                    ``(A) During the 4-year period ending on the date 
                on which the person makes the payment, the person was 
                directly or indirectly formed or established by or at 
                the request or suggestion of, or with the encouragement 
                of, the candidate (including an individual who later 
                becomes a candidate) or committee or agents of the 
                candidate or committee, including with the approval of 
                the candidate or committee or agents of the candidate 
                or committee.
                    ``(B) The candidate or committee or any agent of 
                the candidate or committee solicits funds, appears at a

                activity on the person's behalf during the election 
                cycle involved, including by providing the person with 
                names of potential donors or other lists to be used by 
                the person in engaging in fundraising activity, 
                regardless of whether the person pays fair market value 
                for the names or lists provided. For purposes of this 
                subparagraph, the term `election cycle' means, with 
                respect to an election for Federal office, the period 
                beginning on the day after the date of the most recent 
                general election for that office (or, if the general 
                election resulted in a runoff election, the date of the 
                runoff election) and ending on the date of the next 
                general election for that office (or, if the general 
                election resulted in a runoff election, the date of the 
                runoff election).
                    ``(C) The person is established, directed, or 
                managed by the candidate or committee or by any person 
                who, during the 4-year period ending on the date on 
                which the person makes the payment, has been employed 
                or retained as a political, campaign media, or 
                fundraising adviser or consultant for the candidate or 
                committee or for any other entity directly or 
                indirectly controlled by the candidate or committee, or 
                has held a formal position with the candidate or 
                committee.
                    ``(D) The person has retained the professional 
                services of any person who, during the 2-year period 
                ending on the date on which the person makes the 
                payment, has provided or is providing professional 
                services relating to the campaign to the candidate or 
                committee, without regard to whether the person 
                providing the professional services used a firewall. 
                For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 
                `professional services' includes any services in 
                support of the candidate's or committee's campaign 
                activities, including advertising, message, strategy, 
                policy, polling, allocation of resources, fundraising, 
                and campaign operations, but does not include 
                accounting or legal services.
                    ``(E) The person is established, directed, or 
                managed by a member of the immediate family of the 
                candidate, or the person or any officer or agent of the 
                person has had more than incidental discussions about 
                the candidate's campaign with a member of the immediate 
                family of the candidate. For purposes of this 
                subparagraph, the term `immediate family' has the 
                meaning given such term in section 9004(e) of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

                candidate but is not described in subparagraph (A) or 
                subparagraph (B), but only if the communication is 
                disseminated during the applicable election period.
