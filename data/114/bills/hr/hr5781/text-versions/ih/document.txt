                                 A BILL


 
  To complement the Utah Public Lands Initiative by ensuring land use 
                  certainty in seven counties in Utah.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Utah Public Lands Initiative Partner 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Utah Congressional delegation is advancing the Utah 
        Public Lands Initiative (PLI), a seven county comprehensive 
        land planning bill.
            (2) PLI would designate more than 4,500,000 acres of 
        Federal land for conservation purposes while making more than 
        1,000,000 acres of Federal land available for multiple use and 
        sustained yield.
            (3) Land use certainty and finality are fundamental 
        principles of PLI.
            (4) Section 320301 of title 54, United States Code 
        (commonly known as the ``Antiquities Act of 1906'') empowers 
        the President of the United States with unilateral authority to 
        designate Federal lands as national monuments.
            (5) Enactment of PLI would preclude the need for future 
        Presidents to use section 320301 of title 54, United States 
        Code, in counties that participate in PLI.
            (6) Local community support for PLI would diminish if 
        permanent land use certainty is not achieved through the PLI 
        and this Act.

SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN LANDS IN UTAH.

    A national monument designation, or a boundary adjustment that 
increases the size of an existing national monument, under section 
320301 of title 54, United States Code, within or on any portion of 
Federal land in the counties of Summit, Uintah, Duchesne, Carbon, 
Grand, Emery, and San Juan, in the State of Utah, shall be made only 
pursuant to an Act of Congress.
                                 <all>
