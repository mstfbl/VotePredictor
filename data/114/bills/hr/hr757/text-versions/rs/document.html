&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly 
        violated its commitments to the complete, verifiable, 
        irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs, and 
        has willfully violated multiple United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions calling for it to cease its development, testing, 
        and production of weapons of mass destruction.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) North Korea poses a grave risk for the 
        proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
        destruction.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The Government of North Korea has been 
        implicated repeatedly in money laundering and illicit 
        activities, including prohibited arms sales, narcotics 
        trafficking, the counterfeiting of United States currency, and 
        the counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States 
        persons.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The Government of North Korea has, both 
        historically and recently, repeatedly sponsored acts of 
        international terrorism, including attempts to assassinate 
        defectors and human rights activists, repeated threats of 
        violence against foreign persons, leaders, newspapers, and 
        cities, and the shipment of weapons to terrorists and state 
        sponsors of terrorism.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from 
        the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and 
        committed provocations against South Korea in 2010 by sinking 
        the warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling 
        Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal 
        political prison camps that contain as many as 120,000 men, 
        women, and children, who live in atrocious living conditions 
        with insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under 
        constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) The Congress reaffirms the purposes of the 
        North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 contained in section 4 of 
        such Act (22 U.S.C. 7802).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs 
        and the procurement of luxury goods, in defiance of United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions, and in gross disregard of 
        the needs of its people.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) The President has determined that the 
        Government of North Korea is responsible for knowingly engaging 
        in significant activities undermining cyber security with 
        respect to United States persons and interests, and for threats 
        of violence against the civilian population of the United 
        States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) Persons, including financial institutions, 
        who engage in transactions with, or provide financial services 
        to, the Government of North Korea and its financial 
        institutions without establishing sufficient financial 
        safeguards against North Korea's use of these transactions to 
        promote proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights 
        violations, illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods, 
        aid and abet North Korea's misuse of the international 
        financial system, and also violate the intent of relevant 
        United Nations Security Council resolutions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) The Government of North Korea's conduct poses 
        an imminent threat to the security of the United States and its 
        allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of the 
        United States Armed Forces, to the integrity of the global 
        financial system, to the integrity of global nonproliferation 
        programs, and to the people of North Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) The Congress seeks, through this legislation, 
        to use nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide 
        diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North 
        Korea's conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of 
        North Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In order to achieve the peaceful disarmament of North 
Korea, Congress finds that it is necessary--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to encourage all states to fully and promptly 
        implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2094 
        (2013);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to sanction--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) persons that facilitate proliferation 
                of weapons of mass destruction, illicit activities, 
                arms trafficking, imports of luxury goods, cash 
                smuggling, censorship, and knowingly engage in 
                significant activities undermining cyber security by 
                the Government of North Korea; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) persons that fail to exercise due 
                diligence to ensure that financial institutions do not 
                facilitate any of the activities described in

                Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) to deny the Government of North Korea access 
        to the funds it uses to obtain nuclear weapons, ballistic 
        missiles, offensive cyber capabilities, and luxury goods 
        instead of providing for the needs of its people; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) to enforce sanctions in a manner that avoids 
        any adverse humanitarian impact on the people of North Korea to 
        the extent possible and in a manner that does not unduly 
        constrain the enforcement of such sanctions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 102. INVESTIGATIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The President shall initiate an investigation into the

        sanctions were waived or removed under section 207.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        section 207 and paragraph (3) of this subsection, the President 
        may designate under this subsection any person that the

                subsection (a) an applicable Executive order, or an 
                applicable United Nations Security Council

                described in section 5318A of title 31, United States 
                Code;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) may prohibit any transactions in 
                foreign exchange that are subject to the jurisdiction 
                of the United States and in which such person has any

                through, or to any financial institution, to the extent

                International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
                1705 et seq.) without regard to section 202 of such Act 
                to block any property and interests in property of any 
                person designated under this subsection that are in the

     RIGHTS ABUSES, ILLICIT ACTIVITIES, AND SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES 
                  UNDERMINING CYBER SECURITY&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A 
              JURISDICTION OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING 
              CONCERN.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Undersecretary of the Treasury for 
        Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for 
        safeguarding the financial system against illicit use, money 
        laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of 
        weapons of mass destruction, has repeatedly expressed concern 
        about North Korea's misuse of the international financial 
        system as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In 2006, the Undersecretary stated 
                that, given North Korea's ``counterfeiting of U.S. 
                currency, narcotics trafficking and use of accounts 
                worldwide to conduct proliferation-related 
                transactions, the line between illicit and licit North 
                Korean money is nearly invisible'' and urged financial 
                institutions worldwide to ``think carefully about the 
                risks of doing any North Korea-related 
                business.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) In 2011, the Undersecretary stated 
                that ``North Korea remains intent on engaging in 
                proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing in 
                material,'' and was ``aggressively pursuing the effort 
                to establish front companies.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) In 2013, the Undersecretary stated, in 
                reference to North Korea's distribution of high-quality 
                counterfeit United States currency, that ``North Korea 
                is continuing to try to pass a supernote into the 
                international financial system,'' and that the 
                Department of the Treasury would soon introduce new 
                currency with improved security features to protect 
                against counterfeiting by the Government of North 
                Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an 
        intergovernmental body whose purpose is to develop and promote 
        national and international policies to combat money laundering 
        and terrorist financing, has repeatedly--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in 
                North Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and 
                terrorist financing;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of 
                action to address significant deficiencies in these 
                regimes and the serious threat they pose to the 
                integrity of the international financial 
                system;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply 
                countermeasures to protect the international financial 
                system from ongoing and substantial money laundering 
                and terrorist financing risks emanating from North 
                Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise 
                their financial institutions to give special attention 
                to business relationships and transactions with North 
                Korea, including North Korean companies and financial 
                institutions; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) called on all jurisdictions to protect 
                against correspondent relationships being used to 
                bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation 
                practices, and take into account money laundering and 
                terrorist financing risks when considering requests by 
                North Korean financial institutions to open branches 
                and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security 
        Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task 
                Force's recommendation on financial sanctions related 
                to proliferation, and its guidance on the 
                implementation of sanctions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) decided that Member States should 
                apply enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to 
                prevent the provision of financial services or the 
                transfer of property that could contribute to 
                activities prohibited by applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) called on Member States to prohibit 
                North Korean banks from establishing or maintaining 
                correspondent relationships with banks in their 
                jurisdictions, to prevent the provision of financial 
                services, if they have information that provides 
                reasonable grounds to believe that these activities 
                could contribute to activities prohibited by an 
                applicable United Nations Security Council resolution, 
                or to the evasion of such prohibitions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North 
Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--
Congress--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations 
        Security Council to impose limitations on, and require enhanced 
        monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial 
        institutions that could contribute to sanctioned 
        activities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, 
        to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern, and to adopt stringent 
        special measures to safeguard the financial system against the 
        risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and 
        its illicit activities; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) urges the President to seek the prompt 
        implementation by other states of enhanced monitoring and due 
        diligence to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international 
        financial system, including by sharing information about 
        activities, transactions, and property that could contribute to 
        activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions, or to the evasion of sanctions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
        shall, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, determine, in consultation with the Secretary of 
        State and Attorney General, and in accordance with section 
        5318A of title 31, United States Code, whether reasonable 
        grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction 
        of primary money laundering concern.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Special measures.--If the Secretary of the 
        Treasury determines under this subsection that reasonable 
        grounds exist for finding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, in consultation with the Federal functional 
        regulators, shall impose one or more of the special measures 
        described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 5318A(b) of 
        title 31, United States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction 
        of North Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Report required.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) In general.--If the Secretary of the 
                Treasury determines that North Korea is a jurisdiction 
                of primary money laundering concern, the Secretary of 
                the Treasury shall, not later than 90 days after the 
                date on which the Secretary makes such determination, 
                submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
                report on the determination made under paragraph (1) 
                together with the reasons for that 
                determination.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Form.--A report or copy of any report 
                submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in 
                unclassified form but may contain a classified 
                annex.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 202. ENSURING THE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED 
              NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND FINANCIAL 
              RESTRICTIONS ON NORTH KOREA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) all states and jurisdictions are obligated to 
        implement and enforce applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions fully and promptly, including by--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) blocking the property of, and ensuring 
                that any property is prevented from being made 
                available to, persons designated by the Security 
                Council under applicable United Nations Security 
                Council resolutions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) blocking any property associated with 
                an activity prohibited by applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) preventing any transfer of property 
                and any provision of financial services that could 
                contribute to an activity prohibited by applicable 
                United Nations Security Council resolutions, or to the 
                evasion of sanctions under such resolutions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) all states and jurisdictions share a common 
        interest in protecting the international financial system from 
        the risks of money laundering and illicit transactions 
        emanating from North Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the United States Dollar and the Euro are the 
        world's principal reserve currencies, and the United States and 
        the European Union are primarily responsible for the protection 
        of the international financial system from these 
        risks;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the cooperation of the People's Republic of 
        China, as North Korea's principal trading partner, is essential 
        to the enforcement of applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions and to the protection of the international 
        financial system;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the report of the Panel of Experts established 
        pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874, 
        dated June 11, 2013, expressed concern about the ability of 
        banks in states with less effective regulators and those unable 
        to afford effective compliance to detect and prevent illicit 
        transfers involving North Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) North Korea has historically exploited 
        inconsistencies between jurisdictions in the interpretation and 
        enforcement of financial regulations and applicable United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions to circumvent sanctions 
        and launder the proceeds of illicit activities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East Land, 
        and Tanchon Commercial Bank have been designated by the 
        Secretary of the Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, 
        and the European Union;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking 
        Corporation have been designated by the Secretary of the 
        Treasury and the European Union;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) the Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea has been 
        designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for facilitating 
        transactions on behalf of persons linked to its proliferation 
        network, and for serving as ``a key financial node''; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated by 
        the Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohibited by 
        applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
        including the use of deceptive financial practices to 
        facilitate transactions on behalf of persons linked to North 
        Korea's proliferation network.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the President should intensify diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate 
international fora such as the United Nations and bilaterally, to 
develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy 
for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from 
North Korea, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the cessation of any financial services whose 
        continuation is inconsistent with applicable United Nations 
        Security Council resolutions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the cessation of any financial services to 
        persons, including financial institutions, that present 
        unacceptable risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit 
        activity by the Government of North Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the blocking by all states and jurisdictions, 
        in accordance with the legal process of the state or 
        jurisdiction in which the property is held, of any property 
        required to be blocked under applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the blocking of any property derived from 
        illicit activity, from significant activities undermining cyber 
        security, from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement of 
        public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the 
        Government of North Korea;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the blocking of any property involved in 
        significant activities undermining cyber security by the 
        Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly, against 
        United States persons, or the theft of intellectual property by 
        the Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from 
        United States persons; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the blocking of any property of persons 
        directly or indirectly involved in censorship or human rights 
        abuses by the Government of North Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 203. PROLIFERATION PREVENTION SANCTIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Export of Certain Goods or Technology.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Subject to section 207(a)(2)(C) 
        of this Act, a license shall be required for the export to 
        North Korea of any goods or technology subject to the Export 
        Administration Regulations (part 730 of title 15, Code of 
        Federal Regulations) without regard to whether the Secretary of 
        State has designated North Korea as a country the government of 
        which has provided support for acts of international terrorism, 
        as determined by the Secretary of State under section 6(j) of 
        the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2045), as 
        continued in effect under the International Emergency Economic 
        Powers Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Presumption of denial.--A license for the 
        export to North Korea of any goods or technology as described 
        in paragraph (1) shall be subject to a presumption of

        Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780), and other provisions

        otherwise providing (by sale, lease or loan, grant, or other 
        means), directly or indirectly, any munitions item to the 
        Government of North Korea without regard to whether or not 
        North Korea is a country with respect to which subsection (d) 
        of such section (relating to designation of state sponsors of 
        terrorism) applies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Financial transactions.--Except as provided in 
        section 207 of this Act and the North Korean Human Rights Act 
        of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.), the penalties provided for in 
        section 2332d of title 18, United States Code, shall apply to a 
        United States person that engages in a financial transaction 
        with the Government of North Korea on or after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act to the same extent that such penalties 
        apply to a United States citizen that commits an unlawful act 
        described in section 2332d of title 18, United States 
        Code.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        Government of North Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Applicability.--The prohibition under this 
        subsection with respect to a country shall terminate on the 
        date that is 1 year after the date on which such country ceases 
        to provide lethal military equipment to the Government of North 
        Korea.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Waiver.--The President may, on a case-by-case 
        basis, waive the prohibition under this subsection with respect 
        to a country for a period of not more than 180 days, and may 
        renew the waiver for additional periods of not more than 180 
        days, if the President determines and so reports to the 
        appropriate congressional committees that it is vital to the 
        national security interests of the United States to exercise 
        such waiver authority.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 204. PROCUREMENT SANCTIONS.

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Except as provided in this section, the 
United States Government may not procure, or enter into any contract

person.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) FAR.--The Federal Acquisition Regulation issued 
pursuant to section 1303 of title 41, United States Code, shall be 
revised to require a certification from each person that is a

revision shall apply with respect to contracts in an amount greater 
than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 134 of

        waive the requirement under paragraph (1) with respect to a 
        person based upon a written finding of urgent and compelling 
        circumstances significantly affecting the interests of the 
        United States. If the head of an executive agency waives the 
        requirement under paragraph (1) for a person, the head of the 
        agency shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
        committees, within 30 days after the waiver is made, a report 
        containing the rationale for the waiver and relevant

        the agency shall ensure that such person is entered into the 
        Governmentwide database containing the list of all excluded 
        parties ineligible for Federal programs pursuant to Executive 
        Order No. 12549 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note; relating to debarment and

foreign country or instrumentality designated under section 301(b) of 
such Act (19 U.S.C. 2511(b)).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
be construed to limit the use of other remedies available to the head 
of an executive agency or any other official of the Federal Government 
on the basis of a determination of a false certification under 
subsection (b).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, a report 
identifying foreign sea ports and airports whose inspections of ships,

Korean property, or operated by the Government of North Korea are 
deficient to effectively prevent the facilitation of any of the 
activities described in section 104(a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Enhanced Security Targeting Requirements.--Not later 
than 180 days after the identification of any sea port or airport 
pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, 
utilizing the Automated Targeting System operated by the National 
Targeting Center in U.S. Customs and Border Protection, require 
enhanced screening procedures to determine if physical inspections are 
warranted of any cargo bound for or landed in the United States that 
has been transported through such sea port or airport if there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo contains goods prohibited 
under this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Seizure and Forfeiture.--A vessel, aircraft, or 
conveyance used to facilitate any of the activities described in 
section 104(a) that comes within the jurisdiction of the United States 
may be seized and forfeited under chapter 46 of title 18, United States

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The United States, Japan, and the Republic of 
        Korea (South Korea) share the values of democracy, free and

of each nation and the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government of North Korea--
                    (A) has repeatedly violated its commitments to the 
                complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of 
                its nuclear weapons programs; and
                    (B) has willfully violated multiple United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions calling for North Korea to 
                cease development, testing, and production of weapons 
                of mass destruction.
            (2) Based on its past actions, including the transfer of 
        sensitive nuclear and missile technology to state sponsors of 
        terrorism, North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation 
        of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.
            (3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated 
        repeatedly in money laundering and other illicit activities,

                    (C) the counterfeiting of United States currency;
                    (D) significant activities undermining

                    (A) unilaterally withdrawn from the Agreement 
                Concerning a Military Armistice in Korea, signed at 
                Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (commonly referred to as the 
                ``Korean War Armistice Agreement''); and
                    (B) committed provocations against South Korea--
                            (i) by sinking the warship Cheonan and 
                        killing 46 of her crew on March 26, 2010;
                            (ii) by shelling Yeonpyeong Island and 
                        killing 4 South Korean civilians on November 
                        23, 2010;
                            (iii) by its involvement in the 
                        ``DarkSeoul'' cyberattacks against the 
                        financial and communications interests of South 
                        Korea on March 20, 2013; and

                        post in the South Korean portion of the 
                        demilitarized zone that maimed 2 South Korean 
                        soldiers on August 4, 2015.
            (5) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political 
        prison camps that contain as many as 200,000 men, women, and

        in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the 
        Government of North Korea and its financial institutions 
        without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against

       TITLE I--INVESTIGATIONS, PROHIBITED CONDUCT, AND PENALTIES

SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    In order to achieve the peaceful disarmament of North Korea, 
Congress finds that it is necessary--
            (1) to encourage all member states of the United Nations to 
        fully and promptly implement United Nations Security Council 
        Resolution 2094 (2013);
            (2) to sanction the persons, including financial 
        institutions, that facilitate proliferation, illicit 
        activities, arms trafficking, cyberterrorism, imports of luxury 
        goods, serious human rights abuses, cash smuggling, and 
        censorship by the Government of North Korea;
            (3) to authorize the President to sanction persons who fail 
        to exercise due diligence to ensure that such financial 
        institutions and member states do not facilitate proliferation, 
        arms trafficking, kleptocracy, or imports of luxury goods by 
        the Government of North Korea;
            (4) to deny the Government of North Korea access to the 
        funds it uses to develop or obtain nuclear weapons, ballistic 
        missiles, cyberwarfare capabilities, and luxury goods instead 
        of providing for the needs of the people of North Korea; and
            (5) to enforce sanctions in a manner that does not 
        significantly hinder or delay the efforts of legitimate United 
        States or foreign humanitarian organizations from providing 
        assistance to meet the needs of civilians facing humanitarian 
        crisis, including access to food, health care, shelter, and

 TITLE II--SANCTIONS AGAINST NORTH KOREAN PROLIFERATION, HUMAN RIGHTS 
                     ABUSES, AND ILLICIT ACTIVITIES

SEC. 201. DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA AS A JURISDICTION 
              OF PRIMARY MONEY LAUNDERING CONCERN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and 
        Financial Intelligence, who is responsible for safeguarding the 
        financial system against illicit use, money laundering, 
        terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction, and has repeatedly expressed concern about North 
        Korea's misuse of the international financial system--
                    (A) in 2006--
                            (i) stated, ``Given [North Korea's] 
                        counterfeiting of U.S. currency, narcotics 
                        trafficking and use of accounts world-wide to 
                        conduct proliferation-related transactions, the 
                        line between illicit and licit North Korean 
                        money is nearly invisible.''; and
                            (ii) urged financial institutions worldwide 
                        to ``think carefully about the risks of doing 
                        any North Korea-related business'';
                    (B) in 2011, stated that North Korea--
                            (i) ``remains intent on engaging in 
                        proliferation, selling arms as well as bringing 
                        in material''; and
                            (ii) was ``aggressively pursuing the effort 
                        to establish front companies.''; and
                    (C) in 2013, stated--
                            (i) in reference to North Korea's 
                        distribution of high-quality counterfeit United 
                        States currency, that ``North Korea is 
                        continuing to try to pass a supernote into the 
                        international financial system''; and
                            (ii) the Department of the Treasury would 
                        soon introduce new currency with improved 
                        security features to protect against 
                        counterfeiting by the Government of North 
                        Korea.
            (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental 
        body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and 
        international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist 
        financing, has repeatedly--
                    (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North 
                Korea's regimes to combat money laundering and 
                terrorist financing;
                    (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to 
                address significant deficiencies in those regimes and 
                the serious threat those deficiencies pose to the 
                integrity of the international financial system;
                    (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply 
                countermeasures to protect the international financial 
                system from ongoing and substantial money laundering 
                and terrorist financing risks emanating from North 
                Korea;
                    (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their 
                financial institutions to give special attention to 
                business relationships and transactions with North 
                Korea, including North Korean companies and financial 
                institutions; and
                    (E) called on all jurisdictions--
                            (i) to protect against correspondent 
                        relationships being used to bypass or evade 
                        countermeasures and risk mitigation practices; 
                        and
                            (ii) to take into account money laundering 
                        and terrorist financing risks when considering 
                        requests by North Korean financial institutions 
                        to open branches and subsidiaries in their 
                        respective jurisdictions.
            (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council 
        unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--
                    (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's--
                            (i) recommendation on financial sanctions 
                        related to proliferation; and
                            (ii) guidance on the implementation of such 
                        sanctions;
                    (B) decided that United Nations member states 
                should apply enhanced monitoring and other legal 
                measures to prevent the provision of financial services 
                or the transfer of property that could contribute to 
                activities prohibited by applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and
                    (C) called upon United Nations member states to 
                prohibit North Korean financial institutions from 
                establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships 
                with financial institutions in their respective 
                jurisdictions to prevent the provision of financial 
                services if such member states have information that 
                provides reasonable grounds to believe that such 
                activities could contribute to--
                            (i) activities prohibited by an applicable 
                        United Nations Security Council resolution; or
                            (ii) the evasion of such prohibitions.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North Korea as a 
Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern.--Congress--
            (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security 
        Council to impose limitations on, and to require the enhanced 
        monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial 
        institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;
            (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms--
                    (A) to immediately designate North Korea as a 
                jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and
                    (B) to adopt stringent special measures to 
                safeguard the financial system against the risks posed 
                by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions and its 
                illicit activities; and
            (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation 
        by other countries of enhanced monitoring and due diligence to 
        prevent North Korea's misuse of the international financial 
        system, including by sharing information about activities, 
        transactions, and property that could contribute to--
                    (A) activities sanctioned by applicable United 
                Nations Security Council resolutions; or
                    (B) the evasion of such sanctions.
    (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney 
        General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, 
        United States Code, shall determine whether reasonable grounds 
        exist for concluding that North Korea is a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern.
            (2) Enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements.--If 
        the Secretary of the Treasury determines under paragraph (1) 
        that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea 
        is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Federal functional 
        regulators (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
        Act (15 U.S.C. 6809)), shall impose 1 or more of the special 
        measures described in section 5318A(b) of title 31, United 
        States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction of North Korea.

                report that contains the reasons for such

SEC. 202. ENSURING THE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED NATIONS 
              SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS 
              ON NORTH KOREA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) All member states of the United Nations are obligated 
        to implement and enforce applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions fully and promptly, including by blocking 
        the property of, and ensuring that any property is prevented 
        from being made available to, persons designated for the 
        blocking of property by the Security Council under applicable 
        United Nations Security Council resolutions.
            (2) As of May 2015, 158 of the 193 member states of the 
        United Nations had not submitted reports on measures taken to 
        implement North Korea-specific United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions 1718, 1874, and 2094.
            (3) A recent report by the Government Accountability Office 
        (GAO-15-485)--
                    (A) finds that officials of the United States and 
                representatives of the United Nations Panel of Experts 
                established pursuant to United Nations Security Council 
                Resolution 1874 (2009), which monitors and facilitates 
                implementation of United Nations sanctions on North 
                Korea, ``agree that the lack of detailed reports from 
                all member states is an impediment to the UN's 
                effective implementation of its sanctions''; and
                    (B) notes that ``many member states lack the 
                technical capacity to enforce sanctions and prepare 
                reports'' on the implementation of United Nations 
                sanctions on North Korea.
            (4) All member states share a common interest in protecting 
        the international financial system from the risks of money 
        laundering and illicit transactions emanating from North Korea.
            (5) The United States dollar and the euro are the world's 
        principal reserve currencies, and the United States and the 
        European Union are primarily responsible for the protection of 
        the international financial system from the risks described in 
        paragraph (4).
            (6) The cooperation of the People's Republic of China, as 
        North Korea's principal trading partner, is essential to--
                    (A) the enforcement of applicable United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions; and
                    (B) the protection of the international financial 
                system.
            (7) The report of the Panel of Experts expressed concern 
        about the ability of banks to detect and prevent illicit 
        transfers involving North Korea if such banks are located in 
        member states with less effective regulators or member states 
        that are unable to afford effective compliance.
            (8) North Korea has historically exploited inconsistencies 
        between jurisdictions in the interpretation and enforcement of 
        financial regulations and applicable United Nations Security 
        Council resolutions to circumvent sanctions and launder the 
        proceeds of illicit activities.
            (9) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East Land, and 
        Tanchon Commercial Bank have been designated by the Secretary 
        of the Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, and the 
        European Union as having materially contributed to the 
        proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
            (10) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking 
        Corporation have been designated by the Secretary of the 
        Treasury and the European Union as having materially 
        contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass 
        destruction.
            (11) The Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea has been 
        designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for facilitating 
        transactions on behalf of persons linked to its proliferation 
        network and for serving as ``a key financial node''.
            (12) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated by the 
        Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohibited by 
        applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
        including the use of deceptive financial practices to 
        facilitate transactions on behalf of persons linked to North 
        Korea's proliferation network.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should intensify diplomatic efforts in appropriate 
international fora, such as the United Nations, and bilaterally, to 
develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy 
for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from 
North Korea, including--
            (1) the cessation of any financial services the 
        continuation of which is inconsistent with applicable United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions;
            (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, 
        including financial institutions, that present unacceptable 
        risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity by 
        the Government of North Korea;
            (3) the blocking by all member states, in accordance with 
        the legal process of the state in which the property is held, 
        of any property required to be blocked under applicable United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions;
            (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit 
        activity, or from the misappropriation, theft, or embezzlement 
        of public funds by, or for the benefit of, officials of the 
        Government of North Korea;
            (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant 
        activities undermining cybersecurity by the Government of North 
        Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States persons, 
        or the theft of intellectual property by the Government of 
        North Korea, directly or indirectly from United States persons; 
        and
            (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or 
        indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by the 
        Government of North Korea.
    (c) Strategy to Improve International Implementation and 
Enforcement of United Nations North Korea-specific Sanctions.--The 
President shall direct the Secretary of State, in coordination with 
other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, to develop a

        effective implementation and enforcement of United Nations 
        sanctions would reduce the threat from North Korea;
            (2) to encourage member states of the United Nations to 
        cooperate and share information with the panel in order to help 
        facilitate investigations;
            (3) to expand cooperation with the Panel of Experts;
            (4) to provide technical assistance to member states to 
        implement United Nations sanctions, including developing the 
        capacity to enforce sanctions through improved export control 
        regulations, border security, and customs systems;
            (5) to harness existing United States Government 
        initiatives and assistance programs, as appropriate, to improve 
        sanctions implementation and enforcement; and
            (6) to increase outreach to the people of North Korea, and

        journalistic, humanitarian, and other institutions in North 
        Korea.
