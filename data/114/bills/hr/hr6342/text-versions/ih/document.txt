                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Animal Welfare Act to restrict the use of exotic and wild 
                   animals in traveling performances.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Traveling Exotic Animal and Public 
Safety Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) conditions inherent to traveling performances, 
        including constant travel, temporary and collapsible 
        facilities, and the prolonged confinement and physical coercion 
        of animals, subject exotic and wild animals to compromised 
        welfare and chronic stress, and present public and worker 
        health and safety risks not adequately addressed by current 
        regulation;
            (2) current regulatory oversight of traveling performances 
        is complex and costly, and these costs are not typically 
        recouped via licensing fees, but are left to the American 
        taxpayer;
            (3) the frequent mobility of traveling performances 
        complicates oversight such that agencies and authorities cannot 
        properly monitor, evaluate, or follow through regarding the 
        condition of animals or facilities, or their history of 
        potential injuries, incidents, illnesses, violations, or other 
        issues, and so cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the 
        public;
            (4) traveling exotic and wild animal performances use 
        collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, which risk escape 
        and serious harm to animals, workers, and the public;
            (5) traveling exotic and wild animal performances present 
        safety risks by permitting or not preventing public contact and 
        by displaying animals in inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in 
        dangerous proximity to humans and other animals;
            (6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value; their 
        wild instincts and needs are unpredictable and are not 
        naturally suited to traveling performances, and they suffer as 
        a result of being unable to fulfill instinctive natural 
        behaviors;
            (7) exotic and wild animals used in traveling performances 
        suffer severe and extended confinement, and, deprived of 
        natural movements and behaviors, are prone to chronic stress, 
        behavioral, health, and psychological problems;
            (8) exotic and wild animals are forced to perform unnatural 
        tricks requiring extreme physical coercion, including, but not 
        limited to the use of food and water restrictions, electric 
        shock devices, bullhooks, metal bars, whips, shovels, and 
        pitchforks, among other abuses;
            (9) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild animals in 
        traveling performances to experience the circus or similar 
        events;
            (10) using exotic or wild animals as commodities traded for 
        traveling performances adds nothing to the understanding and 
        conservation of such animals and the natural environment, and 
        actually undermines conservation efforts necessary to protect 
        threatened and endangered species;
            (11) it is not possible to provide or ensure public and 
        worker safety or appropriate physical and mental welfare for 
        exotic and wild animals under the traveling performance 
        business model, which inherently and significantly restricts 
        animals' natural movements and behaviors, and where abuse is 
        prevalent and oversight problematic;
            (12) the use of exotic or wild animals in traveling 
        performances is or substantially affects interstate or foreign 
        commerce, or the free flow thereof; it is essential to regulate 
        such activities to assure animals' humane care and treatment; 
        and
            (13) restricting the use of exotic and wild animals in 
        traveling performances is the most cost-effective and efficient 
        way to safeguard animals, workers, and the public.

SEC. 3. USE OF EXOTIC OR WILD ANIMALS IN TRAVELING PERFORMANCES.

    Section 13 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2143) is amended by
