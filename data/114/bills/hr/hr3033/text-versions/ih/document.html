To require the President's annual budget request to Congress each year 
   to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education 
program of the National Science Foundation and to require the National 
          Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Research Excellence and Advancements 
for Dyslexia Act'' or the ``READ Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Dyslexia is defined as an unexpected difficulty in 
        reading by an individual who has the intelligence to be a much 
        better reader.
            (2) As many as one out of six, or 8,500,000, American 
        school children may have dyslexia.
            (3) Since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of 
        qualifying learning disabilities under the Education for All 
        Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act.

SEC. 3. RESEARCH IN DISABILITIES EDUCATION.

    (a) Program.--Nothing in this Act alters the National Science 
Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education program for fundamental 
and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with 
disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM). The National Science Foundation shall continue 
to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based 
differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including 
differences for dyslexic learners.
    (b)  Line Item.--The Director of the National Science Foundation 
shall include the amount requested for the Research in Disabilities 
Education program in the Foundation's annual congressional budget 
justification.

SEC. 4. DYSLEXIA.

    (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation shall support 
multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research 
on the science of dyslexia, including the early identification of 
children and students with dyslexia, professional development for 
teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, and curricula 
and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia. Research 
supported under this subsection shall be conducted with the goal of 
practical application.
    (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote at least 
$5,000,000 annually to research described in subsection (a), to come 
from amounts made available for the Research and Related Activities 
account or the Education and Human Resources Directorate. No additional 
funds are authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act 
shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by law.
