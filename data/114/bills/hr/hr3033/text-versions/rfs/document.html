To require the President's annual budget request to Congress each year

for Dyslexia Act'' or the ``READ Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) As many as 1 out of 6, or 8,500,000, American school 
        children may have dyslexia.
            (2) Since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of

        Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act.

SEC. 3. RESEARCH IN DISABILITIES EDUCATION.

Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education program for fundamental 
and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with 
disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering,

to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based

differences for dyslexic learners.
    (b) Line Item.--The Director of the National Science Foundation 
shall include the amount requested for the Research in Disabilities 
Education program in the Foundation's annual congressional budget 
justification.

multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research 
on the science of dyslexia, including research on the early 
identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional 
development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, 
curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and 
implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia 
intervention. Research supported under this subsection shall be 
conducted with the goal of practical application.
    (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote at least 
$5 million annually to research described in subsection (a), subject to 
the availability of appropriations, to come from amounts made available 
for the Research and Related Activities account or the Education and 
Human Resources Directorate. No additional funds are authorized to be 
appropriated under this section. This Act shall be carried out using 
funds otherwise appropriated by law after the date of enactment of this 
Act.
