SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Natural Gas Environmental and 
Economic Security Act''.

SEC. 2. GAS WASTE REDUCTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF GAS MEASURING AND 
              REPORTING.

    (a) In General.--Title I of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1711 et seq.) is amended by adding at 
the end the following:

``SEC. 118. GAS WASTE REDUCTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF GAS MEASURING AND

                    ``(A) require that 99 percent of all gas produced 
                that is subject to a mineral leasing law be captured 
                annually within 5 years of enactment of the Natural Gas 
                Environmental and Economic Security Act;

            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, in accordance with 
        this subsection, establish new requirements for measuring and 
        reporting the production and disposition of all gas subject to 
        the mineral leasing laws to allow for more accurate accounting 
        of all such gas that is consumed or lost by venting and 
        flaring, and of fugitive releases of such gas.
            ``(2) Measuring and reporting requirements.--To account for 
        all gas referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall issue 
        rules requiring oil or gas operators to--

        means all oil and gas operations that are subject to mineral 
        leasing law or title V of the Federal Land Policy and 
        Management Act of 1976 (30 U.S.C. 1761 et seq.), regardless of 
        size, including production, storage, gathering, processing, and 
        handling operations.
            ``(2) Flare and flaring.--The term `flaring' means the 
        intentional and controlled burning of gas that occurs in the 
        course of oil and gas operations to limit release of gas to the 
        atmosphere.
            ``(3) Fugitive release.--The term `fugitive release' means 
        the unintentional and uncontrolled release of gas into the 
        atmosphere in the course of oil and gas operations.
            ``(4) Gas capture plan.--The term `gas capture plan' means 
        a plan that includes specific goals, including equipment and 
        timelines, for capturing, gathering, and processing gas 
        produced under an oil or gas lease.
            ``(5) Gas release.--The term `gas release' includes all gas 
        that is discharged to the atmosphere via venting or fugitive 
        release.
            ``(6) Vent and venting.--The term `venting' means the 
        intentional and controlled release of gas into the atmosphere 
        in the course of oil and gas operations.''.

    (c) Deadline.--The Secretary of the Interior shall issue rules 
required by the amendments made by this section by not later than 1 
year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (d) Assessment of Venting, Flaring, and Fugitive Releases.--Not 
later than 6 months after the end of the 1-year period beginning on the 
date the Secretary of the Interior first receives data submitted under 
the requirements established under subsection (b) of section 118 of the 
Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, as amended by this 
section, the Secretary shall--
            (1) submit a report to Congress describing--
                    (A) the volume of fugitive releases, and gas 
                consumed or lost by venting and flaring, from covered 
                operations (as those terms are used in such section);
                    (B) additional rules the Secretary considers 
                necessary to further curtail venting, flaring, and 
                fugitive releases, or the rational basis for not 
                issuing new rules if the Secretary considers new rules 
                are not necessary; and
                    (C) recommendations for new statutory authority 
                necessary to limit venting, flaring, or fugitive 
                releases; and

                    (A) gas used or consumed within the area of the 
                lease tract for the benefit of the lease (commonly 
                referred to as ``beneficial use gas''); and
                    (B) all gas that is consumed or lost by venting, 
                flaring, or fugitive releases through any equipment 
                during upstream operations.
            (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect 
        to--
                    (A) gas vented or flared in an acute emergency
