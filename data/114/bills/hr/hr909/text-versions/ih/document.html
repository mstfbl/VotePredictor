    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act 
and every two years thereafter through 2023, the Comptroller General of 
the United States shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education,

analysis of the extent to which individual patients have access to 
investigational drugs pursuant to subsection (b) of section 561 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb) and 
recommendations for improving such access. In preparing such report, 
the Comptroller General shall conduct a qualitative analysis of the 
following:
            (1) Whether there are any identifiable patterns in requests 
        submitted under subsection (b) of such section, such as the 
        types of indications for which requests for individual patient 
        access are sought or the reasons for the denial of such 
        requests.

        requests for individual patient access.
            (3) How the Secretary evaluates safety and efficacy data 
        submitted in connection with such requests.
            (4) The amount of time that--
                    (A) a physician typically takes to complete the 
                paperwork necessary to make such a request;
                    (B) a drug sponsor takes to process such a request 
                and to issue a decision with respect to the request; 
                and
                    (C) the Secretary takes to process such a request 
                and to issue a decision with respect to the request.
            (5) How regulations, guidance, policies, or practices may 
        be modified, streamlined, expanded, or discontinued to reduce 
        or prevent delays in approving such requests.
            (6) The number of such requests that, for the period 
        covered by the report--
                    (A) were approved by drug sponsors and the Food and 
                Drug Administration;
                    (B) were approved by drug sponsors but denied by 
                the Food and Drug Administration; and
                    (C) were denied by drug sponsors.
            (7) How to encourage drug sponsors to grant requests for 
        expanded access under such section 561, including requests for 
        emergency use, intermediate-size patient populations, and large 
        patient populations under a specified indication.
            (8) Whether and to what extent adverse events reported to 
        the Secretary as a result of individual use of an 
        investigational drug or investigational device under such 
        section 561 affected the development or approval of any drug or 
        device.
