                legislative language contained in the report submitted 
                pursuant to subsection (b)(3)(B), upon receipt by the 
                Congress, shall be introduced not later than 14 
                calendar days after the date of such submission, in the 
                Senate and in the House of Representatives by the 
                majority leader of each House of Congress, for himself, 
                the minority leader of each House of Congress, for 
                himself, or any member of the House designated by the 
                majority leader or minority leader. If the Task Force 
                bill is not introduced in accordance with the preceding 
                sentence in either House of Congress, then any Member 
                of that House may introduce the Task Force bill on any 
                day thereafter. Upon introduction, the Task Force bill 
                shall be referred to the appropriate committees under 
                subparagraph (C).
                    (B) Committee consideration.--A Task Force bill 
                introduced in either House of Congress shall be jointly 
                referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction 
                of that House, which committees shall report the bill 
                without any revision and with a favorable 
                recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or 
                without recommendation, not later than 7 calendar days 
                after the date of introduction of the bill in that 
                House, or the first day thereafter on which that House 
                is in session. If any committee fails to report the 
                bill within that period, that committee shall be 
                automatically discharged from consideration of the 
                bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate 
                calendar.
            (2) Expedited procedures.--
                    (A) Fast track consideration in house of 
                representatives.--
                            (i) Proceeding to consideration.--It shall 
                        be in order, not later than 2 days of session 
                        after the date on which a Task Force bill is 
                        reported or discharged from all committees to 
                        which it was referred, for the majority leader 
                        of the House of Representatives or the majority 
                        leader's designee, to move to proceed to the 
                        consideration of the Task Force bill. It shall 
                        also be in order for any Member of the House of 
                        Representatives to move to proceed to the 
                        consideration of the Task Force bill at any 
                        time after the conclusion of such 2-day period. 
                        All points of order against the motion are 
                        waived. Such a motion shall not be in order 
                        after the House has disposed of a motion to 
                        proceed on the Task Force bill. The previous 
                        question shall be considered as ordered on the 
                        motion to its adoption without intervening 
                        motion. The motion shall not be debatable. A 
                        motion to reconsider the vote by which the 
                        motion is disposed of shall not be in order.
                            (ii) Consideration.--The Task Force bill 
                        shall be considered as read. All points of 
                        order against the Task Force bill and against 
                        its consideration are waived. The previous 
                        question shall be considered as ordered on the 
                        Task Force bill to its passage without 
                        intervening motion except 60 hours of debate 
                        equally divided and controlled by the proponent 
                        and an opponent, and any motion to limit 
                        debate. A motion to reconsider the vote on 
                        passage of the Task Force bill shall not be in 
                        order.
                            (iii) Appeals.--Appeals from decisions of 
                        the chair relating to the application of the 
                        Rules of the House of Representatives to the 
                        procedure relating to a Task Force bill shall 
                        be decided without debate.
                            (iv) Application of house rules.--Except to 
                        the extent specifically provided in paragraph 
                        (2)(A), consideration of a Task Force bill 
                        shall be governed by the Rules of the House of 
                        Representatives. It shall not be in order in 
                        the House of Representatives to consider any 
                        Task Force bill introduced pursuant to the 
                        provisions of this subsection under a 
                        suspension of the rules pursuant to Clause 1 of 
                        House Rule XV, or under a special rule reported 
                        by the House Committee on Rules.
                            (v) No amendments.--No amendment to the 
                        Task Force bill shall be in order in the House 
                        of Representatives.
                            (vi) Vote on passage.--Immediately 
                        following the conclusion of consideration of 
                        the Task Force bill, the vote on passage of the 
                        Task Force bill shall occur without any 
                        intervening action or motion, requiring an 
                        affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
                        Members, duly chosen and sworn. If the Task 
                        Force bill is passed, the Clerk of the House of 
                        Representatives shall cause the bill to be 
                        transmitted to the Senate before the close of 
                        the next day of session of the House. The vote 
                        on passage shall occur not later than December 
                        31, 2016.
                            (vii) Vote.--The House Committee on Rules 
                        may not report a rule or order that would have 
                        the effect of causing the Task Force bill to be 
                        approved by a vote of less than three-fifths of 
                        the Members, duly chosen and sworn.
                    (B) Fast track consideration in senate.--
                            (i) In general.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII 
                        of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in 
                        order, not later than 2 days of session after 
                        the date on which a Task Force bill is reported 
                        or discharged from all committees to which it 
                        was referred, for the majority leader of the 
                        Senate or the majority leader's designee to 
                        move to proceed to the consideration of the 
                        Task Force bill. It shall also be in order for 
                        any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to 
                        the consideration of the Task Force bill at any 
                        time after the conclusion of such 2-day period. 
                        A motion to proceed is in order even though a 
                        previous motion to the same effect has been 
                        disagreed to. All points of order against the 
                        motion to proceed to the Task Force bill are 
                        waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. 
                        The motion is not subject to a motion to 
                        postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
                        which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to 
                        shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
                        to the consideration of the Task Force bill is 
                        agreed to, the Task Force bill shall remain the 
                        unfinished business until disposed of.
                            (ii) Debate.--All points of order against 
                        the Task Force bill and against consideration 
                        of the Task Force bill are waived. 
                        Consideration of the Task Force bill and of all 
                        debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                        therewith shall not exceed a total of 60 hours. 
                        Debate shall be divided equally between the 
                        majority and minority leaders or their 
                        designees. A motion further to limit debate on 
                        the Task Force bill is in order, shall require 
                        an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
                        Members duly chosen and sworn, and is not 
                        debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is 
                        debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be 
                        divided equally between those favoring and 
                        those opposing the motion or appeal. All time 
                        used for consideration of the Task Force bill, 
                        including time used for quorum calls and 
                        voting, shall be counted against the total 100 
                        hours of consideration.
                            (iii) No amendments.--An amendment to the 
                        Task Force bill, or a motion to postpone, or a 
                        motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                        business, or a motion to recommit the Task 
                        Force bill, is not in order.
                            (iv) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage 
                        shall occur immediately following the 
                        conclusion of the debate on a Task Force bill, 
                        and a single quorum call at the conclusion of 
                        the debate if requested. Passage shall require 
                        an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
                        Members, duly chosen and sworn. The vote on 
                        passage shall occur not later than December 31, 
                        2016.
                            (v) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--
                        Appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
                        relating to the application of the rules of the 
                        Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure 
                        relating to a Task Force bill shall be decided 
                        without debate.
                    (C) Rules to coordinate action with other house.--
                            (i) Referral.--If, before the passage by 
                        one House of a Task Force bill of that House, 
                        that House receives from the other House a Task 
                        Force bill, then the Task Force bill of the 
                        other House shall not be referred to a 
                        committee and shall immediately be placed on 
                        the calendar.
                            (ii) Procedure.--If the Senate receives the 
                        Task Force bill passed by the House of 
                        Representatives before the Senate has voted on 
                        passage of the Task Force bill--
                                    (I) the procedure in the Senate 
                                shall be the same as if no Task Force 
                                bill had been received from House of 
                                Representatives; and
                                    (II) the vote on passage in the 
                                Senate shall be on the Task Force bill 
                                of the House of Representatives.
                            (iii) Treatment of task force bill of other 
                        house.--If one House fails to introduce or 
                        consider a Task Force bill under this section, 
                        the Task Force bill of the other House shall be

                        senate.--If, following passage of the Task 
                        Force bill in the Senate, the Senate then 
                        receives the Task Force bill from the House of 
                        Representatives, the House-passed Task Force 
                        bill shall not be debatable. The vote on 
                        passage of the Task Force bill in the Senate 
                        shall be considered to be the vote on passage 
                        of the Task Force bill received from the House 
                        of Representatives.
