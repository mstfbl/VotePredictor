 To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require identification and 
description on the website of the Federal Communications Commission of 
     items to be decided on authority delegated by the Commission.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF ITEMS TO BE DECIDED ON 
              AUTHORITY DELEGATED BY THE COMMISSION.

    (a) In General.--Section 5(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 
U.S.C. 155(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(10) Not later than 48 hours before the time when an order, 
decision, report, or action is made or taken pursuant to delegation 
under paragraph (1), such order, decision, report, or action shall be 
identified and briefly described on the Internet website of the 
Commission, unless the authority to which the delegation is made for 
good cause finds that such identification and description are likely to 
lead to a result described in a paragraph of section 552b(c) of title 
5, United States Code. This paragraph shall not apply with respect to 
an order, decision, report, or action that--
            ``(A) does not receive a delegated authority number 
        pursuant to the procedures of the Commission;
            ``(B) is made or taken on authority delegated to an 
        administrative law judge; or
            ``(C) is made or taken to address an immediate threat to 
        health or safety that constitutes an emergency requiring an 
        expedited response from the Commission.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
with respect to an order, decision, report, or action made or taken 
after the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act.
