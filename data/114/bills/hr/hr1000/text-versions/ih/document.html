                                 A BILL


 
    To establish the National Full Employment Trust Fund to create 
              employment opportunities for the unemployed.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act shall be cited as the ``Humphrey-Hawkins 21st Century Full 
Employment and Training Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 
        established an interim 5-year target of 3-percent unemployment 
        for individuals 20 years of age and older, and 4 percent for 
        individuals age 16 and over within 5 years, with full 
        employment to be achieved ``as soon as practicable'' 
        thereafter.
            (2) The Federal Government has previously established full 
        employment as a national goal in national legislation, 
        including the Employment Act of 1946 and the Full Employment 
        and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.
            (3) Pursuant to these Acts, the Congress declared it is the 
        continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government 
        to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions 
        which promote useful employment opportunities for all who seek 
        them, including the self-employed. Pursuant to these Acts, the 
        Congress declared and established as a national goal the 
        fulfillment of the right to full opportunities for useful paid 
        employment at fair rates of compensation of all individuals 
        able, willing, and seeking to work.
            (4) The Nation has suffered substantial unemployment and 
        underemployment, and idleness of productive resources over 
        prolonged periods of time, imposing numerous economic and 
        social costs on the Nation.
            (5) The Nation has been deprived of the full supply of 
        goods and services, the full utilization of labor and capital 
        resources, and the related increases in economic well-being 
        that would occur under conditions of genuine full employment.
            (6) The current output of goods and services is 
        insufficient to meet pressing national priorities for 
        infrastructure, transportation, energy, education, health care, 
        child and elder care, and many other necessary public and human 
        services.
            (7) Unemployment and underemployment expose many workers 
        and families to significant, social, psychological and 
        physiological costs, including disruption of family life, the 
        loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and the 
        aggravation of physical and psychological illnesses.
            (8) Persisting unemployment and underemployment have 
        devastating financial consequences, resulting in the loss of 
        income and spending power for families, and interfering with 
        their ability to save and accumulate assets for a secure family 
        life and retirement. High levels of unemployment and inadequate 
        consumer demand also contribute to poor conditions for retail 
        businesses, manufacturers and many other firms to grow and 
        prosper. In the real estate sector, the Congress finds that 
        continuing high levels of unemployment contribute to 
        foreclosures, evictions, and commercial vacancies, undermining 
        the quality of neighborhood and community life, and hampering 
        prospects for economic recovery and national prosperity.
            (9) The historic promise of this earlier legislation has 
        not been fully realized, and we re-declare and reaffirm our 
        support for achieving a national goal of jobs for all at living 
        wages.
            (10) The United States has a duty under Articles 55 and 56 
        of the United Nations Charter to promote ``full employment'' 
        and the ``universal respect for, and observance of, human 
        rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as 
        to race, sex, language, or religion''. The human rights the 
        United States has a duty to promote pursuant to this obligation 
        are set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
        Article 23 of the Universal Declaration states that ``Everyone 
        has the right to work'' and to ``just and favorable 
        remuneration'' that insures for his or her family ``an 
        existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if 
        necessary, by other means of social protection''.
            (11) The Congress has a strong interest in seeking the 
        progressive reduction and elimination of job disparities among 
        groups of workers who experience chronically higher rates of 
        unemployment and underemployment.
            (12) Even at the top of the business cycle, when national 
        unemployment rates drop to the 4-percent to 5-percent range, 
        job vacancy surveys show that the economy does not provide 
        enough jobs to employ everyone who wants to work. Reliance on 
        direct job creation to close the economy's job gap is 
        especially important at such times, because it provides a means 
        of creating additional jobs without adding significantly to 
        inflationary pressures, a very difficult goal to achieve at the 
        top of the business cycle via macroeconomic policy 
        interventions.
            (13) The Congress intends to maximize the creation of 
        private, public and nonprofit sector jobs through improved use 
        of general economic and structural policies, including measures 
        to encourage private sector investment and capital formation; 
        an increased public investment in research and development, 
        infrastructure, energy, education, public services and the 
        environment, and other essential goods and services.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of the Humphrey-Hawkins 21st 
Century Full Employment and Training Act of 2015 to fulfill the right 
to useful work at living wages for all persons seeking employment by 
establishing a Full Employment Trust Fund to fund and operate a 
national program of public service employment and to provide additional 
labor market opportunities to complement those offered by the existing 
private, public, and nonprofit sectors.

        established in section 5; and
            (2) issuing funds to the Secretary to fund programs under 
        the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (29 U.S.C. 
        3101 et seq.).
    (b) Financing the Trust Fund.--Subject to the availability of 
appropriations for this purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
annually make available to the Secretary of Labor for deposit into the 
Trust Fund an amount equal to the amount collected for that year 
through the tax described in section 4475 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as added by section 8.
    (c) Loans From the Federal Reserve System.--
            (1) In general.--If the amount available in the Trust Fund 
        for allocation under section 5 is insufficient to prevent the 
        national unemployment rate from rising more than one full 
        percentage point above its previously attained level, the Board 
        of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall lend such 
        additional amounts to the Trust Fund as are necessary to allow 
        the Secretary of Labor to make such additional allocations 
        under section 5 as are necessary to restore the national 
        unemployment rate to its allowable 1-percent range of upward 
        variation.
            (2) Repayment.--Amounts lent to the Trust Fund by the Board 
        of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under paragraph (1) 
        shall be repaid by the Trust Fund over 10 years, with interest 
        payable at the same average rate the Federal Government 
        contracts to pay on 10-year bonds sold during the period 
        beginning 45 days prior to the date the loans were made to the 
        Trust Fund and ending 45 days following such date.
    (d) Separate Trust Fund Accounts.--The Trust Fund shall consist of 
2 separate accounts as follows:
            (1) One account shall consist of 67 percent of the funds 
        made available for deposit under subsection (b) and shall be 
        for the Employment Opportunity Grants established in section 5.
            (2) The other account shall consist of 33 percent of the 
        funds made available for deposit under subsection (b) and shall 
        be available to the Secretary to fund programs under the 
        Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (29 U.S.C. 
        3101 et seq.).

to serve as an information clearinghouse for job training and 
employment opportunities funded by the Trust Fund.
    (f) Training Stipend.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations 
requiring entities that receive funds under programs under the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 (29 U.S.C. 3101 et

establish training stipends for individuals who participate in such 
programs.
    (g) Research Facility.--The Secretary, through studies conducted by 
the Department of Labor or through independent studies, shall--

        creation programs funded under this Act;
            (2) disseminate information concerning best practices for 
        achieving the goals of the Act as well as common difficulties 
        encountered in that endeavor; and
            (3) acquire a better understanding of the true net cost of 
        the job training and job creation programs funded under this 
        Act by documenting the indirect effects of those programs on 
        the revenues received and costs incurred by different levels of 
        government.

        and
            (6) ensure that not less than 35 percent of individuals 
        employed under the grant are individuals described in paragraph

    (f) Employment Described.--Employment funded under this section 
shall meet the following specifications:
            (1) Any employer that employs an individual whose 
        employment is funded under the grant shall--
                    (A) continue to employ such individual for not less 
                than 12 months, subject to the individual's 
                satisfactory performance of the reasonable requirements 
                of the individual's employment;
                    (B) if such an individual desires full-time 
                employment, employ such individual for not less than 35 
                hours per week and not more than 40 hours, and if such 
                an individual desires part-time work, employ such 
                individual for a mutually agreed number of hours per 
                week that is less than 35 hours per week;
                    (C) comply with responsible contractor standards, 
                as determined by the relevant official in the unit of 
                local general government;
                    (D) provide compensation to such individual on a 
                per hour basis equal to the compensation provided to 
                public sector employees who perform similar work in the 
                community where such individual is employed or, if no 
                public sector employees perform such similar work, 
                provide compensation to such individual that is 
                comparable to the compensation provided to private-
                sector employees who perform similar work in the 
                community where such individual is employed;
                    (E) if such employment is in construction, provide 
                compensation to any laborer or mechanic employed under 
                the grant at rates not less than those prevailing on 
                similar construction in the locality as determined by 
                the Secretary in accordance with subchapter IV of 
                chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code; and
                    (F) offer assistance to such individual in applying

            (2) No individual whose employment is funded under the 
        grant may work for an employer at which a collective bargaining 
        agreement is in effect covering the same or similar work, 
        unless--
                    (A) the consent of the union at such employer is 
                obtained; and
                    (B) negotiations have taken place between such 
                union and the employer as to the terms and conditions 
                of such employment.
            (3)(A) An employer may not employ an individual for a 
        position funded under this Act, if--
                    (i) employing such individual will result in the 
                layoff or partial displacement (such as a reduction in 
                hours, wages, or employee benefits) of an existing 
                employee of the employer; or
                    (ii) such individual will perform the same or 
                substantially similar work that had previously been 
                performed by an employee of the employer who--
                            (I) has been laid off or partially 
                        displaced (as such term is described in 
                        subclause (I)); and
                            (II) has not been offered by the employer, 
                        to be restored to the position the employee had 
                        immediately prior to being laid off or 
                        partially displaced.
            (B) For the purposes of this paragraph, a position shall be 
        considered to have been eliminated by an employer if the 
        position has remained unfilled and the unit or organization has 
        not sought to fill such position for at least a period of one 
        month.
            (C) An individual may not be hired for a position funded 
        under this Act in a manner that infringes upon the promotional 
        opportunities of an existing employee (as of the date of such 
        hiring) of an employer receiving funds under this Act.
            (4) An individual seeking employment in a job funded under 
        this Act shall have their eligibility for such employment 
        certified by the State employment service in the State where 
        the job is located. To be certified as eligible for such 
        employment, the individual shall satisfy at least one of the 
        following conditions as of the date the individual is hired to 
        fill a job funded under this Act:
                    (A) The individual is receiving unemployment 
                insurance benefits.
                    (B) The individual is unemployed, is a member of a 
                targeted group as defined by section 51(d) of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and has been seeking 
                employment, with the assistance of the State employment 
                service, for not less than 30 days prior to the date on 
                which the individual is so hired.
                    (C) The individual is unemployed and has been 
                seeking employment, with the assistance of the State 
                employment service, for not less than 60 days prior to 
                the date the individual is so hired.
                    (D) The individual has been employed part-time 
                while seeking full-time employment with the assistance 
                of the State employment service for not less than 13 
                weeks prior to the date the individual is so hired.
            (5) An individual employed in a job funded under this Act 
        shall--
                    (A) notwithstanding the individual's employment in 
                a job funded under this Act, be registered with the 
                appropriate State employment service as available for 
                and seeking work;
                    (B) respond appropriately, as a person available 
                for and seeking employment, to referrals by the State 
                employment service concerning available jobs;
                    (C) apply for suitable jobs for which the 
                individual has been referred by the State employment 
                service; and
                    (D) accept a suitable job if such job is offered to 
                the individual.
        For purposes of subparagraphs (C) and (D), the term ``suitable 
        job'' means a job that a newly unemployed individual receiving 
        unemployment insurance benefits would be required to accept in 
        order to avoid forfeiting the individual's eligibility for 
        continued receipt of unemployment insurance benefits under the 
        laws of the State in which the individual is employed in a job 
        funded under this Act. An individual employed under this Act 
        shall be granted time off with pay to comply with subparagraph 
        (C). An individual who fails to comply with the requirements 
        set forth in subparagraphs (C) and (D) without good cause shall 
        be subject to disqualification for employment in a job funded 
        under this act for a period not to exceed 13 weeks, after which 
        time the individual's eligibility shall be restored provided 
        they have satisfied the eligibility requirements set forth in 
        paragraph 4. Any such disqualification must be effected in 
        accord with the laws, regulations and procedures that govern an 
        individual's disqualification from continued receipt of 
        Unemployment Insurance benefits in the State, except that no 
        wages paid or owing to the individual for work already 
        performed can be forfeited as a result of such proceeding.
            (6) An individual employed in a job funded under this Act 
        who terminates that employment in order to accept other 
        employment, and who subsequently is terminated from that other 
        employment without fault on the individual's part, shall be 
        eligible for immediate reemployment in a job funded under this 
        Act.
            (7) In hiring individuals for positions funded under this 
        Act, or using funds under this Act to continue to provide 
        employee compensation for existing employees, an employer shall 
        comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, 
        personnel policies and regulations, and collective bargaining 
        agreements, as if such individual was hired, or such employee 
        compensation were provided, without assistance under this Act.
            (8) An individual hired for a position funded under this 
        Act shall--
                    (A) be considered an employee of the employer, by 
                which such individual was hired; and
                    (B) receive the same employee compensation, have 
                the same rights and responsibilities and job 
                classifications, and be subject to the same job 
                standards, employer policies, and collective bargaining 
                agreements as if such individual were hired without 
                assistance under this Act.
    (g) Award of Grants.--
            (1) Selection criteria.--In selecting a project to receive 
        funding for employing the individuals described in subsection 
        (f)(4), a grant recipient shall consider--
                    (A) the input of all participants in a proposed 
                project, including labor organizations, community

                developed to meet such needs.
            (2) Priority given to certain projects.--A grant recipient 
        under this section shall give priority to projects that--
                    (A) serve areas with the greatest level of economic 
                need, determined for each such area by--
                            (i) the unemployment rate;
                            (ii) the rate of poverty;
                            (iii) the number of census tracts with 
                        concentrated poverty;
                            (iv) the lowest median income;
                            (v) the percentage of vacant and abandoned 
                        properties;
                            (vi) the percentage of home foreclosures; 
                        and
                            (vii) the indicators of poor resident 
                        health, including high rates of chronic 
                        disease, infant mortality, and life expectancy;
                    (B) integrate education and job skills training, 
                including basic skills instruction and secondary

                    (C) coordinate to the maximum extent feasible with 
                pre-apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs; and
                    (D) provide jobs in sectors where job growth is 
                most likely, as determined by the Secretary, and in 
                which career advancement opportunities exist to 
                maximize long-term, sustainable employment for 
                individuals after employment funded under this Act 
                ends.
    (h) Allocation of Grants.--The total amount of grant funding 
awarded under this section for a fiscal year shall not exceed 90 
percent of the funds available in the account described in section 
4(d)(1) for such year. The Secretary shall develop criteria for the 
allocation of these funds. These criteria shall ensure, to the extent 
reasonably possible, that--
            (1) the number of jobs created with those funds in each 
        community will be proportionate to the level of unemployment, 
        involuntary part-time employment, and non-labor-force 
        participation by persons who want and are available to accept 
        jobs in each community, and
            (2) the type of jobs created with those funds in each 
        community will be designed to match the qualifications of 
        unemployed and under-employed job-seekers in those communities, 
        taking into consideration available training opportunities.
If the total number of jobs created in a particular community under 
this Act falls short of the number needed to provide jobs for 
substantially all job seekers, the Secretary of Labor shall have the 
authority to establish and administer its own job creation projects in 
the community.
    (i) Reports.--

                activity of such projects during the previous fiscal 
                year.

                projects during the previous fiscal year.
                    (E) The amount of money received and expended 
                during the fiscal year.

                for purposes of the Housing Act of 1937 and the

                    (B) Appointment by secretary.--If the parties 
                cannot agree on an arbitrator within 5 days of 
                submitting the grievance to binding arbitration under 
                subparagraph (A), one of the parties may submit a 
                request to the Secretary to appoint a qualified and

                qualified and independent arbitrator within 15 days 
                after receiving the request.
                    (C) Hearing.--Unless the parties mutually agree

        award such remedies as are necessary to make the grieving party 
        whole, including the reinstatement of a displaced employee or 
        the payment of back wages, and may submit recommendations to 
        the Secretary to ensure further compliance with the 
        requirements of this title, including recommendations to

              UNEMPLOYMENT.

    (a) Determination on Inflation.--Whenever the conditions specified 
in subsection (k) are satisfied, the Secretary shall make a 
determination as to whether there is good cause to believe that--
            (1) job creation funded under this Act constitutes a 
        significant contributing factor to the elevation of the rate of 
        inflation above the level set forth in subsection (k); and
            (2) a reduction in the number of persons employed in jobs 
        funded under this Act is necessary to restore the rate of 
        inflation to a level below that set forth in subsection (k).
    (b) Suspension of Hiring.--If the Secretary determines that such 
good cause exists, the Secretary shall issue an interim order 
temporarily--

requesting public comment thereon. The comment period announced in this 
notice shall last for 30 days from the day the notice is published. The

for that purpose and to which representatives of the national news 
media have been invited.

impact statement or analysis of the order's effect shall be required 
under any other statute.

period described in subsection (c) has expired and the Secretary has 
considered the comments received relating to the interim order for a 
period not to exceed 15 additional days, the Secretary shall--
            (1) either revoke the interim order or confirm it with or 
        without changes;
            (2) cause all applicants for and recipients of Employment 
        Opportunity Grants under section 5 to be notified of such 
        confirmation or revocation in the manner described in 
        subsection (c)(1); and
            (3) publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing 
        such confirmation or revocation along with a statement 
        summarizing the views submitted by the public during the 
        comment period and setting forth in reasonable detail the 
        evidence, reasoning, and arguments relied upon and rejected in 
        deciding whether to revoke the interim order or confirm it with 
        or without changes.
    (f) Continuance of Authority.--If the interim order is confirmed, 
either with or without changes, the Secretary shall have the authority 
to transfer funds from the account described in subsection (d)(1) of 
section 4 to the account described in subsection (d)(2) of section 4 to 
the extent necessary to provide additional training opportunities for 
persons whose employment in jobs funded under this Act has been 
temporarily suspended.
    (g) Waiver.--Any person who would be eligible for employment in a 
job funded under this Act but for the order described in subsections 
(b) and (e) shall be afforded the opportunity to apply for a waiver of 
the order's application to them on the grounds that it would cause them 
or their family to suffer undue hardship. The Secretary shall establish 
procedures and rules insuring that such waiver applications are 
considered and decided in an expeditious manner.
    (h) No Early Termination, Suspension in Hiring, or Reduction in 
Wages.--No person employed in a job funded under this Act shall have 
their employment prematurely terminated to achieve the purposes of this 
section. Hiring for jobs funded under this Act of persons described in 
subsections (f)(4)(B) and (f)(4)(C) of section 5 may not be suspended 
to achieve the purposes of this section. The hourly wages paid for jobs 
funded under this Act may not be reduced to achieve the purposes of 
this section.
    (i) Waiver of Applicability.--The Secretary shall have the 
authority to waive the applicability of the order described in sections

extent necessary to prevent layoffs by the grant recipient of persons 
already employed by them in jobs funded under this Act.
    (j) Duration of Order.--The order described in subsections (b) and 
(e) shall remain in effect only as long as the conditions specified in 
subsection (k) are satisfied.
    (k) Inflationary Trigger.--The Secretary's authority to act under 
this section shall arise only when both of the following conditions are 
jointly satisfied:
            (1) The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the 
        civilian labor force of the United States, as reported by the 
        United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in its most recent 
        Employment Situation News Release, is less than 4.0 percent.
            (2) The seasonally adjusted consumer price index for all 
        urban consumers in the United States, as reported by the United 
        States Bureau of Labor Statistics in its most recent Consumer 
        Price Index News Release, is more than 3 percent above its 
        level during the same period one year earlier.
