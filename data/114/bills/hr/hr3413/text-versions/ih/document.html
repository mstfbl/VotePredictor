                                 A BILL


 
 To require a report on requirements and risks in connection with the 
  use of radioisotopic power systems for space exploration beyond low-
                              Earth orbit.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Efficient Space Exploration Act''.

SEC. 2. REPORT ON REQUIREMENTS AND RISKS IN USE OF RADIOISOTOPIC POWER 
              SYSTEMS FOR SPACE EXPLORATION BEYOND LOW-EARTH ORBIT.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) conducting deep space exploration requires radioisotope 
        power systems, such as thermoelectric and Stirling generators 
        and converters;
            (2) establishing continuity in the production of the 
        material needed to power such radioisotope power systems is 
        paramount to the success of future deep space missions; and
            (3) Federal agencies supporting the National Aeronautics 
        and Space Administration through the production of the material 
        described in paragraph (2) should do so in a cost effective 
        manner so as not to impose excessive reimbursement requirements 
        on the Administration.
    (b) Analysis of Requirements and Risks.--The Director of the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy and the Administrator of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, in consultation with the heads of 
other Federal agencies, conduct an analysis of--
            (1) the requirements of the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration for radioisotope power system material that is 
        needed to carry out planned, high priority robotic missions in 
        the solar system and other surface exploration activities 
        beyond low-Earth orbit; and
            (2) the risks to missions of the Administration in meeting 
        those requirements, or any additional requirements, due to a 
        lack of adequate radioisotope power system material.
    (c) Contents of Analysis.--The analysis conducted under subsection 
(b) shall--
            (1) detail the current projected mission requirements and 
        associated timeframes for radioisotope power systems and 
        radioisotope power system material;
            (2) explain the assumptions used to determine the 
        requirements of the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration for the material, including--
                    (A) the planned use of advanced thermal conversion 
                technology, such as advanced thermocouples and Stirling 
                generators and converters; and
                    (B) the risks and implications of, and 
                contingencies for, any delays or unanticipated 
                technical challenges affecting or related to the 
                mission plans of the Administration for the anticipated 
                use of advanced thermal conversion technology;
            (3) assess the risk to the programs of the Administration 
        of any potential delays in achieving the schedule and 
        milestones for planned domestic production of radioisotope 
        power system material;
            (4) outline a process for meeting any additional 
        Administration requirements for the material;
            (5) estimate the incremental costs required to increase the 
        amount of material produced each year, if such an increase is 
        needed to support additional Administration requirements for 
        the material;
            (6) detail how the Administration and other Federal 
        agencies will manage, operate, and fund production facilities 
        and the design and development of all radioisotope power 
        systems used by the Administration and other Federal agencies 
        as necessary;
            (7) specify the steps the Administrator will take, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to preserve the 
        infrastructure and workforce necessary for production of 
        radioisotope power systems and ensure that Administration 
        reimbursements to the Department of Energy associated with such 
        preservation are equitable and justified;
            (8) identify the steps the Administrator will take to 
        preserve taxpayer investment to date in Advanced Stirling 
        Convertor technology; and
            (9) detail how the Administrator has implemented or 
        rejected the recommendations of the National Research Council 
        in the 2009 report titled ``Radioisotope Power Systems: An 
        Imperative for Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Space 
        Exploration''.
    (d) Transmittal.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration shall transmit the results of the analysis 
conducted under subsection (b) to the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology of the House of Representatives.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
