                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Secretary of Labor to carry out a research program to 
  evaluate the effectiveness of the Transition Assistance Program in 
           addressing the needs of certain minority veterans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Success in Transition for All 
Veterans Act''.

SEC. 2. RESEARCH PROGRAM TO EVALUATE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRANSITION 
              ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN ADDRESSING NEEDS OF CERTAIN 
              MINORITY VETERANS.

    (a) Research Program.--Beginning not later than June 1, 2017, the 
Secretary of Labor, in collaboration with the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs and the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out a research 
program to evaluate the Transition Assistance Program under section 
1144 of title 10, United States Code. Such research program shall be 
designed to determine how effectively the Transition Assistance Program 
addresses the differentiated needs, challenges, and post-military 
service aspirations of women veterans, veterans with disabilities, 
Native American veterans, veterans who are residents of a territory of 
the United States, veterans who are part of the indigenous population 
of a territory of the United States, and other groups of minority 
veterans identified by the Secretaries.
    (b) Issues Addressed.--The Secretary of Labor shall ensure that the 
research program required under subsection (a) addresses each of the 
following issues:
            (1) In the context of the transition experience, whether 
        and how the barriers to employment facing women veterans, 
        veterans with disabilities, Native American veterans, veterans 
        who are residents of a territory of the United States, veterans 
        who are part of the indigenous population of a territory of the 
        United States, and other identified groups of minority veterans 
        are substantively different from other populations of the 
        veteran community.
            (2) In the context of the transition experience, whether 
        and how the post-military service employment aspirations such 
        groups of veterans covered by the research project are 
        substantively different from such aspirations of other 
        populations of the veteran community.
            (3) To the extent that any barriers to employment or 
        aspirations are identified under paragraph (1) or (2) as being 
        substantially different for any of the groups of veterans 
        covered by the research project, whether the Transition 
        Assistance Program is designed to appropriately address those 
        differences.
            (4) To the extent that the Transition Assistance Program is 
        determined not to be designed to appropriately address a 
        difference under paragraph (3), an identification of any change 
        that could be made to the Program to more appropriately address 
        such difference.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
commencement of the research program under this section, the Secretary 
of Labor shall submit to Congress a report on the research program.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
