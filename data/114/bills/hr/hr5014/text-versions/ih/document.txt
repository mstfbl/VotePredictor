SEC. 2. LEGAL PRODUCTION, PURCHASE, AND POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA BY

    (a) In General.--The fact that an Indian tribe, a member of an 
Indian tribe, or a tribal entity is legally authorized to produce, 
purchase, or possess marijuana on lands held in fee by that Indian 
tribe, lands held in trust by the United States for the benefit of that 
Indian tribe, or lands conveyed to an Alaska Native Corporation 
pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), shall not be considered when--
            (1) allocating or distributing Federal funds or other 
        Federal benefits to the Indian tribe, a member of an Indian 
        tribe, or the tribal entity;
            (2) determining the eligibility of the Indian tribe or the 
        tribal entity for any contract, grant, or other agreement with 
        the United States, or the renewal or modification thereof, 
        where the legal production, purchase, or possession of 
        marijuana by the Indian tribe or a member of an Indian tribe 
        would otherwise disqualify the Indian tribe from eligibility;
            (3) evaluating the ongoing compliance of the Indian tribe 
        or the tribal entity with any contract, grant, or other 
        agreement with the United States where the legal production, 
        purchase, or possession of marijuana by the Indian tribe or a 
        member of an Indian tribe would otherwise result in the Indian 
        tribe or tribal entity being out of compliance; and
            (4) determining if the Indian tribe or a member of an 
        Indian tribe is eligible for Federal benefits for which the 
        Indian tribe or a member of an Indian tribe would otherwise be 
        eligible.
    (b) Clarification.--This section shall not prohibit consideration 
of income from the legal production, purchase, or possession of
