   To provide alternatives to incarceration for youth, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Youth.--
            ``(1) General rule.--Notwithstanding any provision of law 
        other than this subsection, when sentencing a youth for a 
        nonviolent offense, the court may impose a sentence below a 
        statutory minimum if, after considering the factors set forth 
        in subsection (a), the court finds--
                    ``(A) substantial and compelling reasons on the 
                record that, giving due regard to the nature of the 
                crime, the history and characteristics of the youth, 
                and the youth's chances of successful rehabilitation, 
                the mandatory minimum sentence would result in 
                substantial injustice to the youth; and
                    ``(B) imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence 
                is not necessary for the protection of the public.
            ``(2) Court to give parties notice.--Before imposing a 
        sentence under paragraph (1), the court shall give the parties 
        reasonable notice of the court's intent to do so and an 
        opportunity to respond.
            ``(3) Statement in writing of factors.--The court shall 
        state, in the written statement of reasons, the factors under 
        subsection (a) that require imposition of a sentence below the 
        statutory minimum.
            ``(4) Appeal rights not limited.--This subsection does not 
        limit any right to appeal that would otherwise exist in its 
        absence.
            ``(5) Definitions.--In this subsection--
                    ``(A) the term `youth' means an individual who was 
                21 years of age or younger at the time of the criminal 
                offense for which the individual is being sentenced; 
                and
                    ``(B) the term `nonviolent offense' means a Federal 
                criminal offense that is not--

        follows:
            ``(2) Home confinement authority.--
                    ``(A) The authority under this subsection may be 
                used--

                        confinement for the greater of 10 percent of

                        months.
                    ``(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), 
                placement in a community correction center shall not be 
                used in lieu of home confinement solely because the 
                prisoner has been diagnosed with a mental illness, 
                mental disorder, or mental health condition.
                    ``(C) There shall be a presumption in favor of 
                direct release to home confinement unless the Director 
                of the Bureau of Prisons makes specific findings in 
                writing that the resources provided by a community 
                correction center are necessary for the prisoner to 
                adjust and prepare for the reentry into the community 
                and those resources cannot be provided if the prisoner 
                is in home confinement.
                    ``(D) A prisoner placed on home confinement may not 
                be ordered to pay the cost of electronic monitoring.'';
