 To amend title IV of the Social Security Act to address the increased 
burden that maintaining the health and hygiene of infants and toddlers

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title IV of the Social Security Act to address the increased 
burden that maintaining the health and hygiene of infants and toddlers 
  places on families in need, the resultant adverse health effects on 
children and families, and the limited child care options available for 
infants and toddlers who lack sufficient diapers, which prevents their 
           parents and guardians from entering the workforce.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hygiene Assistance for Families of 
Infants and Toddlers Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Access to a reliable supply of clean diapers is a 
        medical necessity for the health and welfare of infants and 
        toddlers, their families, and child care and health care 
        providers, yet in a representative survey of mothers in the 
        United States, 1 in 3 mothers reported having to cut back on 
        essentials in order to afford enough diapers for a child.
            (2) In the United States, most children begin toilet 
        training between 2 and 3 years of age, and after toilet 
        training is complete, the child will not need diapers. Families 
        with infants and toddlers are more likely to be economically 
        disadvantaged than other families. Infants and toddlers are 
        more likely to live with low-income and poor families than 
        older children, 25 percent of infants and toddlers live with 
        families earning less than the Federal poverty level, and 47 
        percent of infants and toddlers live with families earning less 
        than twice the Federal poverty level. There are over 980,000 
        infants and toddlers who are recipients of assistance under the 
        program of block grants to States for temporary assistance for 
        needy families (TANF), over one-third of all families enrolled 
        in such a State program include an infant or toddler, and the 
        average monthly diaper bill of $70 to $80 represents at least 8 
        percent and up to 40 percent of the average amount of cash 
        assistance provided to a family through such a State program.
            (3) The average monthly diaper bill of $70 to $80 
        represents 6 percent of the pretax income of a parent working 
        full time for Federal minimum wage. Approximately 46 percent of 
        low-income children and 26 percent of poor infants and toddlers 
        live with at least 1 parent who is employed full time and year 
        round, and only 47 percent of low-income children and 35 
        percent of poor infants and toddlers live with married parents.
            (4) Without child care, parents and guardians of infants 
        and toddlers cannot participate in the workforce, but most 
        child care providers require parents to provide a supply of 
        clean disposable diapers for their children. In a 2014 survey 
        of 1,129 clients of 8 large diaper banks conducted by the 
        National Diaper Bank Network, 12.4 percent of respondents 
        indicated that the respondent was unable to leave a child at a 
        child care provider at least 1 day a month because the 
        respondent's child lacked diapers, and 47.5 percent of 
        respondents said that the diapers received from the diaper bank 
        enabled the respondent to go to work. Therefore, increasing 
        availability of clean diapers for needy infants and toddlers 
        furthers the national goal of enabling parents to participate 
        in the workforce to increase their economic self-sufficiency, 
        and enables better implementation of title I of the Personal 
        Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.
            (5) Increasing the availability of clean diapers for needy 
        infants and toddlers furthers the national goal of increasing 
        access to safe and quality child care for all families, and 
        therefore enables better implementation of the Child Care and 
        Development Block Grant Act of 1990.
            (6) Insufficient diaper changes can lead to not only 
        increased irritability and discomfort of a child, leading to 
        increased parental stress, but also to diaper dermatitis, skin 
        breakdown, open sores with a risk of infection, and urinary 
        tract infections for the child, which require medical 
        attention. In a survey commissioned by Feeding America in 2011, 
        48 percent of food bank clients surveyed said they would delay 
        changing a diaper and 32 percent said they would reuse 
        disposable diapers in order to make their diaper supply last 
        longer. This increases the risk of negative health outcomes for 
        children and their families.
            (7) A study from the Yale School of Medicine found a direct 
        correlation between lacking enough clean diapers to change a 
        child's diapers as often as required--a condition called 
        ``diaper need''--and maternal depression, which can adversely 
        affect maternal-child bonding, a mother's ability to care for 
        her child, and a mother's ability to work outside the home.
            (8) Diapers have proven to be valuable incentives in 
        smoking cessation programs, parenting training programs, and 
        other programs promoting positive and healthy behaviors.
            (9) Increasing the availability of clean diapers for needy 
        families furthers public health by providing improved health 
        outcomes for children, reducing visits to the emergency room, 
        and reducing parental stress and depression.
