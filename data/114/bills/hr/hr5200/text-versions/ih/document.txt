Federation and how and to what extent such cooperation affects United 
States national security and strategic interests.
    (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required by subsection (a) 
shall include the following:
            (1) How and to what extent Iran and the Russian Federation 
        cooperate on matters relating to Iran's space program, 
        including how and to what extent such cooperation strengthens 
        Iran's ballistic missile program.
            (2) How and to what extent Iran's interests and actions and 
        the Russian Federation's interests and actions overlap with 
        respect to Latin America.
            (3) A description and analysis of the intelligence-sharing 
        center established by Iran, the Russian Federation, and Syria 
        in Baghdad, Iraq and whether such center is being used for 
        purposes other than the purposes of the joint mission of such 
        countries in Syria.
            (4) A description and analysis of--
                    (A) naval cooperation between Iran and the Russian 
                Federation, including joint naval exercises between the

        Action.
            (6) The likelihood that Iran might adopt the Russian 
        Federation model of hybrid warfare against potential targets 
        such as Gulf Cooperation Council states with sizeable Shiite 
        populations.
            (7) The extent of Russian Federation cooperation with 
        Hezbollah in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, including cooperation 
        with respect to training and equipping and joint operations.
            (8) A full and explicit list of weapons that if sold by the 
        Russian Federation to Iran would violate relevant United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions imposing an arms embargo
