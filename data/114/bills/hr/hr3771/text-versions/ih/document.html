    (b) Legislative Procedure.--
            (1) In general.--Each committee so directed under 
        subsection (a) shall, not later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, submit the recommendations described in 
        such subsection to the chair of the Committee on the Budget of 
        the House of Representatives, which upon receiving all such 
        recommendations, shall report to the House of Representatives, 
        not later than 30 days thereafter, the bill described in 
        paragraph (2).
            (2) Bill described.--A bill described in this paragraph is 
        a bill--
                    (A) consisting of legislation carrying out the 
                recommendations described in subsection (a) without any 
                substantive revision; and
                    (B) entitled ``A bill to provide for reductions in 
                direct spending to meet the direct spending targets 
                provided for in the Terms of Credit Act.''.
            (3) Failure to submit recommendations.--The Committee on 
        Rules of the House of Representatives may make in order 
        amendments to carry out the recommendations described in 
        subsection (a) if a committee of the House fails to submit 
        recommendations to the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives consistent with paragraph (1).
    (c) Expedited Consideration in the House of Representatives.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than five legislative days after 
        the bill described in subsection (b) or section 102(a) is 
        reported or the committees of referral have been discharged 
        from further consideration thereof, it shall be in order to 
        move to proceed to consider the bill in the House. Such a 
        motion shall be in order only at a time designated by the 
        Speaker in the legislative schedule within two legislative days 
        after the day on which the proponent announces an intention to 
        the House to offer the motion provided that such notice is 
        provided after such bill is reported. Such a motion shall not 
        be in order after the House has disposed of a motion to proceed 
        with respect to that bill. The previous question shall be 
        considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without 
        intervening motion.
            (2) Consideration.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), if 
        the motion to proceed is agreed to, the House shall immediately 
        proceed to consider the bill referred to in paragraph (1) in 
        the House without intervening motion. Such bill shall be 
        considered as read. Except as provided in paragraph (3), all 
        points of order against such bill and against its consideration 
        are waived. The previous question shall be considered as 
        ordered on such bill to its passage without intervening motion 
        except 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the 
        bill.
            (3) Extraneous matter.--A provision containing an 
        extraneous matter may not be reported in a bill considered 
        pursuant to this subsection, and may not be considered as an 
        amendment thereto. When the House is considering a bill 
        pursuant to paragraph (2), upon a point of order being made by 
        any Member against material extraneous to the directives to a 
        committee which is contained in any title or provision of the 
        bill or offered as an amendment to the bill, and the point of 
        order is sustained by the Chair, any part of said title or 
        provision that contains material extraneous to the instructions 
        shall be deemed stricken from the bill and no provision deemed 
        extraneous may be offered as an amendment from the floor. For 
        purposes of the preceding sentence, a provision of a bill 
        considered pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be considered 
        extraneous if such provision does not produce a net decrease in 
        outlays or produces a net increase in revenue. In making a 
        determination as to the extraneous nature of a provision, 
        material, or part, the Chair shall rely on estimates from the 
        Committee on the Budget.
            (4) Special rule.--If the House adopts a special order of 
        business for the consideration of the bill referred to in 
        paragraph (1), including a special order of business which may 
        make amendments to the bill in order, the bill shall be 
        considered under the terms and conditions of that special order 
        of business, except that such special order of business may not 
        provide for debate for a period of time to exceed 10 hours, 
        equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an 
        opponent.
            (5) Termination of expedited procedures.--After the House 
        has passed a bill or bills that meet the total amount of each 
        spending reduction directive under subsection (a) as estimated 
        by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, the expedited 
        procedures under this subsection shall no longer apply.

SEC. 102. CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS.

    (a) In General.--If the Committee on the Budget fails to report the 
bill required under section 101(b) prior to the deadline set forth 
under such section for reporting the bill, any Member of the House of 
Representatives may introduce a bill to accomplish spending reduction 
directives under section 101(a)(1).
    (b) Consideration in the House of Representatives.--
            (1) Referral and reporting.--Except as provided in 
        paragraph (2), any committee of the House of Representatives to 
        which a bill introduced pursuant to subsection (a) is referred 
        shall report it to the House without amendment not later than 
        the fifth legislative day after the date of its introduction. 
        If a committee fails to report the bill within that period or 
        the House has adopted a concurrent resolution providing for 
        adjournment sine die at the end of a Congress, such committee 
        shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of 
        the bill and it shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.
            (2) Requiring minimum reduction in direct spending.--A 
        committee of the House to which a bill is referred under this 
        section is not required to report the bill to the House if the 
        bill does not reduce direct spending by at least 5 percent of 
        the directive applicable to the committee under section 101(a), 
        as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.
            (3) Expedited procedures.--Any bill reported or discharged 
        pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be considered under the 
        expedited procedures described under section 101(c).
            (4) Termination of expedited procedures.--After the House 
        has passed a bill or bills that meet the total amount of each 
        spending reduction directive under section 101(a) as estimated 
        by the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, the expedited 
        procedures under paragraph (3) shall no longer apply.

SEC. 103. EXPEDITED PROCEDURES IN THE SENATE.

    (a) Committee Consideration.--In the Senate, upon receipt of a bill 
passed in the House pursuant to section 101 or 102 shall be jointly 
referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction, which shall 
report the bill without any revision and with a favorable 
recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or without 
recommendation, not later than 5 legislative days after receipt in the 
Senate. If any committee fails to report the bill within that period, 
that committee shall be automatically discharged from consideration of 
the bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.
    (b) Motion To Proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 2 days of session 
after the date on which a bill under paragraph (1) is reported or 
discharged from all committees to which it was referred, for the 
majority leader of the Senate or the majority leader's designee to move 
to proceed to the consideration of the bill. It shall also be in order 
for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of 
such bill at any time after the conclusion of such 2-day period. A 
motion to proceed is in order even though a previous motion to the same 
effect has been disagreed to. All points of order against the motion to 
proceed to the bill are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. 
The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. If a motion to 
proceed to the consideration of the bill is agreed to, the bill shall 
remain the unfinished business until disposed of.
    (c) Consideration.--All points of order against the bill and 
against consideration of the bill are waived. Consideration of the bill 
and of all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall 
not exceed a total of 30 hours which shall be divided equally between 
the Majority and Minority Leaders or their designees. A motion further 
to limit debate on the bill is in order, shall require an affirmative 
vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, and is not 
debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to 
exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those 
opposing the motion or appeal. All time used for consideration of the 
bill, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall be counted 
against the total 30 hours of consideration.
    (d) Vote on Passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to the 
bill, the vote on passage of the bill shall occur immediately following 
the conclusion of the debate on the bill, and a single quorum call at 
the conclusion of the debate if requested.
    (e) Rulings of the Chair on Procedure.--Appeals from the decisions 
of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate, as 
the case may be, to the procedure relating to the bill shall be decided 
without debate.

SEC. 104. BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

    (a) Vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment.--Not later than December 
31, 2015, the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively, shall

follows: ``Joint resolution proposing a balanced budget amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States.''.
    (b) Consideration by the Other House.--
            (1) House consideration.--
                    (A) Referral.--If the House receives a joint 
                resolution described in subsection (a) from the Senate, 
                such joint resolution shall be referred to the 
                Committee on the Judiciary. If the committee fails to 
                report the joint resolution within five legislative 
                days, it shall be in order to move that the House 
                discharge the committee from further consideration of 
                the joint resolution. Such a motion shall not be in 
                order after the House has disposed of a motion to 
                discharge the joint resolution. The previous question 
                shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
                adoption without intervening motion except twenty 
                minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
                proponent and an opponent. If such a motion is adopted, 
                the House shall proceed immediately to consider the 
                joint resolution in accordance with subparagraph (C). A 
                motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
                disposed of shall not be in order.
                    (B) Proceeding to consideration.--After the joint 
                resolution has been referred to the appropriate 
                calendar or the committee has been discharged (other 
                than by motion) from its consideration, it shall be in 
                order to move to proceed to consider the joint 
                resolution in the House. Such a motion shall not be in 
                order after the House has disposed of a motion to 
                proceed with respect to the joint resolution. The 
                previous question shall be considered as ordered on the 
                motion to its adoption without intervening motion. A 
                motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
                disposed of shall not be in order.
                    (C) Consideration.--The joint resolution shall be 
                considered as read. All points of order against the 
                joint resolution and against its consideration are 
                waived. The previous question shall be considered as 
                ordered on the joint resolution to its passage without 
                intervening motion except two hours of debate equally 
                divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent 
                and one motion to limit debate on the joint resolution. 
                A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of the joint 
                resolution shall not be in order.
            (2) Senate consideration.--
                    (A) Referral.--If the Senate receives a joint 
                resolution described in subsection (a) from the House 
                of Representatives, such joint resolution shall be 
                referred to the appropriate committee of the Senate. If 
                such committee has not reported the joint resolution at 
                the close of the fifth session day after its receipt by 
                the Senate, such committee shall be automatically 
                discharged from further consideration of the joint 
                resolution and it shall be placed on the appropriate 
                calendar.
                    (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Consideration of 
                the joint resolution and on all debatable motions and 
                appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to 
                not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided equally 
                between the majority and minority leaders or their 
                designees. A motion to further limit debate is in order 
                and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to 
                postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration 
                of other business, or a motion to recommit the joint 
                resolution is not in order. Any debatable motion or 
                appeal is debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be 
                divided equally between those favoring and those 
                opposing the motion or appeal. All time used for 
                consideration of the joint resolution, including time 
                used for quorum calls and voting, shall be counted 
                against the total 20 hours of consideration.
                    (C) Consideration.--If the Senate has voted to 
                proceed to a joint resolution, the vote on passage of 
                the joint resolution shall be taken on or before the 
                close of the seventh session day after such joint 
                resolution has been reported or discharged or 
                immediately following the conclusion of consideration 
                of the joint resolution, and a single quorum call at 
                the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance 
                with the rules of the Senate.

action.
