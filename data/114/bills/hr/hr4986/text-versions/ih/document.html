                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Sewall-Belmont House National Historic Site as a unit 
          of the National Park System, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sewall-Belmont House Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Sewall-Belmont House was designated as a National 
        Historic Landmark, National Historic Site, and an affiliated 
        area of the National Park Service in 1974;
            (2) beginning in 1929, the Sewall-Belmont House served as 
        the headquarters of the National Woman's Party, founded by 
        Alice Paul (1885-1977), the most significant figure in the 
        final phase of the struggle for a constitutional amendment 
        granting women the right to vote;
            (3) Alice Paul revived the movement, employing dramatic 
        techniques, White House demonstrations, hunger strikes, and 
        relentless political pressure, to achieve victory just prior to 
        the 1920 election; and
            (4) in June 2015, the National Park Service completed a 
        feasibility study of the Sewall-Belmont House National Historic 
        Site, in which the National Park Service determined that--
                    (A) the Sewall-Belmont House National Historic Site 
                met the criteria for inclusion in the National Park 
                System, confirming national significance, suitability, 
                feasibility, and the need for direct National Park 
                Service management; and
                    (B) the Sewall-Belmont House would help fill 
                identified gaps in the National Park System related to 
                the 20th century women's rights movement and 
                strengthening the overall interpretation of women's 
                history.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Sewall-
Belmont House National Historic Site as a unit of the National Park 
System to preserve and protect the site and to interpret the nationally 
significant resources related to the women's rights movement.
