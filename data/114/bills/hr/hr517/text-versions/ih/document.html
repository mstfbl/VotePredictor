                the responsible use of available resources.
                    (D) The importance of the claimant friendly, 
                nonadversarial nature of the appeals process.
            (3) Matters included.--In carrying out the study under 
        paragraph (1), the Appeals Task Force shall examine the

                including an analysis of--
                            (i) the most effective means to quickly and

                        utility of the Veterans Benefits Management 
                        System with respect to appeals operations, 
                        including an identification of key changes that

                                of Columbia; and
                                    (III) whether Board Members should 
                                be required to pass the administrative
