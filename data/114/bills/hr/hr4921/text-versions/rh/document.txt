amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 3108. Requirement to maintain records
    ``(a) In General.--If the Internal Revenue Service obtains a 
preserved record, the Internal Revenue Service shall preserve for not 
less than 3 years from the date on which the record was obtained--
            ``(1) the preserved record or a copy of the preserved 
        record; and
            ``(2) all records related to the preserved record.
    ``(b) Preserved Record Defined.--In this section, the term 
`preserved record' means any record that is maintained by a person 
other than the Federal Government pursuant to a rule, guidance, or 
other directive from the Internal Revenue Service that requires or 
recommends the person maintain records for a particular period of time 
on a particular matter.
    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as--
            ``(1) limiting the preservation of a preserved record for a 
        longer period of time than is required by this section; or
            ``(2) shortening the period of time a preserved record is 
        otherwise required to be maintained.''.
    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for 
chapter 31 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following new item:

``3108. Requirement to maintain records.''.
    (c) Effective Date; Applicability.--The amendments made by this 
section shall take effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act 
and shall apply with respect to any preserved record (as such term is 
defined in section 3108(b) of title 44, United States Code, as added by 
subsection (a)) obtained on or after the effective date.
