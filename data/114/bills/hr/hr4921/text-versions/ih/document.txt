        record; and
            ``(2) all records related to the preserved record.

other directive from the Internal Revenue Service that requires or 
recommends the person maintain records for a particular period of time 
on a particular matter.
    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as--

        longer period of time than is required by this section; or
            ``(2) shortening the period of time a preserved record is 
        otherwise required to be maintained.''.

chapter 31 of title 44, United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following new item:

``3108. Requirement to maintain records.''.
    (c) Effective Date; Applicability.--The amendments made by this 
section shall take effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act

subsection (a)) obtained on or after the effective date.
                                 <all>
