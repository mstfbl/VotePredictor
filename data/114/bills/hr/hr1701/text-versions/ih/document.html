_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Amendment Enforcement Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Supreme Court of the United States has confirmed 
        that the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
        States protects a fundamental, individual right to keep and 
        bear arms independent of service in an organized militia.
            (2) Federal courts have repeatedly found provisions of the 
        gun control laws of the District of Columbia to be 
        unconstitutional, most recently in the case of Palmer v. 
        District of Columbia, No. 1:09-CV-1482, 2014 WL 3702854 (D.D.C. 
        July 24, 2014), which invalidated on Second Amendment grounds 
        the District's total ban on carrying firearms outside the home 
        for self-defense. Despite these reproofs, District officials 
        have repeatedly and publicly asserted their determination to 
        continue passing laws aimed at curbing the exercise of the 
        right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding residents and 
        visitors.
            (3) The law-abiding residents of the District of Columbia 
        are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns 
        that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the 
        United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their 
        persons, homes, businesses, and families.
            (4) The District of Columbia remains one of the most 
        dangerous large cities in the United States. The District's gun 
        control regulations interfere with the right of law-abiding 
        residents and visitors to protect themselves from violent 
        crime.
            (5) Federal law already provides comprehensive regulation 
        of the manufacture, sale, and possession of firearms, including 
        the licensing of commercial conduct. These regulations apply in 
        the District of Columbia, as elsewhere. The District's attempt 
        to expand upon these regulations with its own regulations has 
        created a confusing, onerous, and inhibiting environment for 
        individuals in the District who wish to engage in lawful 
        commercial activities relating to firearms.
            (6) Legislation is required to correct the District of 
        Columbia's laws in order to restore the fundamental rights of 
        its residents under the Second Amendment and thereby enhance 
        public safety.

SEC. 3. REFORMING D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.

    Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the killing of 
wild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia'' , approved 
June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec. 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code), is 
amended by adding at the end the following: ``Nothing in this section 
or any other provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to 
permit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory 
authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively 
prohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons not prohibited from 
possessing firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in 
their homes or businesses, carrying, transporting, or using for 
sporting, self-protection, or other lawful purposes, any firearm 
neither prohibited by Federal law nor subject to chapter 53 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (commonly referred to as the `National 
Firearms Act'). The District of Columbia shall not have authority to 
enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private 
ownership or use of firearms for legitimate purposes.''.

SEC. 4. REPEAL OF D.C. SEMIAUTOMATIC BAN.

    Section 101(10) of the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975 
(sec. 7-2501.01(10), D.C. Official Code) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(10) `Machine gun' means any firearm which shoots, is 
        designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, 
        automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by 
        a single function of the trigger. The term `machine gun' shall 
        also include the frame or receiver of any such firearm, any 
        part designed and intended solely and exclusively, or 
        combination of parts designed and intended, for use in 
        converting a firearm into a machine gun, and any combination of 
        parts from which a machine gun can be assembled if such parts 
        are in the possession or under the control of a person.''.
