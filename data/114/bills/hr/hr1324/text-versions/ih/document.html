``Arapaho National Forest Boundary Adjustment'' and dated November 6,

Township 4 North, Range 76 West, Sixth Principal Meridian, Colorado. A 
lot described in this subsection may be included in the boundary

permission for such action from the lot owner or owners.
    (b) Bowen Gulch Protection Area.--The Secretary of Agriculture 
shall include all Federal land within the boundary described in 
subsection (a) in the Bowen Gulch Protection Area established under

    (c) Land and Water Conservation Fund.--For purposes of section 
200306(a)(2)(B)(i) of title 54, United States Code, the boundaries of 
the Arapaho National Forest, as modified under subsection (a), shall be 
considered to be the boundaries of the Arapaho National Forest as in 
existence on January 1, 1965.
    (d) Public Motorized Use.--Nothing in this Act opens privately 
owned lands within the boundary described in subsection (a) to public 
motorized use.
    (e) Access to Non-Federal Lands.--Notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 6(f) of the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993 (16 U.S.C. 539j(f)) 
regarding motorized travel, the owners of any non-Federal lands within 
the boundary described in subsection (a) who historically have accessed 
their lands through lands now or hereafter owned by the United States 
within the boundary described in subsection (a) shall have the 
continued right of motorized access to their lands across the existing 
roadway.
