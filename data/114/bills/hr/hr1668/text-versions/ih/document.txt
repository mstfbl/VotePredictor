                        through the Chief of Engineers, or the 
                        Secretary of the Interior determines that there 
                        is a drought in effect in such river basin that 
                        the U.S. Drought Monitor categorizes as D2 
                        (Severe Drought), D3 (Extreme Drought), or D4

                        drought in effect in such river basin; and
                    ``(B) ends on the date on which--
                            ``(i) in the case of a suspension that 
                        begins under subparagraph (A)(i), the Secretary 
                        that made the determination referred to in that 
                        subparagraph determines that the drought is no 
                        longer in effect; or
                            ``(ii) in the case of a suspension that 
                        begins under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Governor 
                        determines that the drought is no longer in 
                        effect.
            ``(3) Prohibition of enforcement by state.--
                    ``(A) Prohibition.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), a State may not enforce the 
                requirements of this Act with respect to any area of 
                the State with respect to which a suspension under 
                paragraph (1) applies.
                    ``(B) Enforcement of state law not affected.--
                Subparagraph (A) does not affect the authority of a 
                State to carry out and enforce the laws of the State.
            ``(4) Excepted water releases.--This subsection does not 
        prohibit any release of water from a water storage facility for 
        purposes of this Act by the Secretary of the Army, the 
        Secretary of the Interior, or a State if such Secretary or the 
        Governor of such State, respectively, certifies that--
                    ``(A) such release will not cause harm to the 
                local, regional, State, or Federal economy; and

                required to be taken by any water users as a result of 
                such release.
            ``(5) U.S. drought monitor defined.--In this subsection the
