SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Timely Payments for Flood Victims

SEC. 2. DEADLINE FOR APPROVAL OF CLAIMS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1312 of the National Flood Insurance Act 
of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4019) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``The Administrator'' 
        and inserting ``Subject to other provisions of this section, 
        the Administrator''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d) Deadline for Approval of Claims.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide that, in 
        the case of any claim for damage to or loss of property under 
        flood insurance coverage made available under this title, a 
        final determination regarding approval of a claim for payment 
        or disapproval of the claim be made, and notification of such 
        determination be provided to the insured making such claim, not 
        later than the expiration of the 30-day period (as such period 
        may be extended pursuant to paragraph (2)) beginning upon the 
        day on which such claim was made. Payment of approved claims 
        shall be made as soon as possible after such approval.
            ``(2) Extension of deadline.--The Administrator shall 
        provide that the period referred to in paragraph (1) may be 
        extended by a single additional period of 15 days in cases 
        where extraordinary circumstances are demonstrated. The 
        Administrator shall, by regulation, establish criteria for 
        demonstrating such extraordinary circumstances and for 
        determining to which claims such extraordinary circumstances 
        apply.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to any claim under flood insurance coverage made available under 
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) 
pending on the date of the enactment of this Act and any claims made 
after such date of enactment.
