   To amend the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize a State to reimburse

after a petition for certification of eligibility for trade adjustment

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Training Enhancement Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The viability of the domestic steel industry is crucial 
        to the United States economy and national security.
            (2) The steel and taconite iron mining industries have been 
        severely impacted by the foreign dumping and overproduction of 
        steel and are continually faced with unfair trade practices.
            (3) In 2014, United States imports of steel and steel 
        products increased by 36 percent and captured 28 percent of the 
        total United States steel market. In 2015, United States 
        imports of steel and steel products continued to increase, and 
        captured 29 percent of the total United States steel market.
            (4) In 1974, Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
        U.S.C. 2101 et seq.), which established the trade adjustment 
        assistance program under chapter 2 of title II of that Act (19 
        U.S.C. 2271 et seq.) to assist workers who have been adversely 
        affected by trade.
            (5) The trade adjustment assistance program provides vital 
        benefits and services to workers whose employment has been 
        adversely affected by foreign trade. Those benefits and 
        services include education and training, income support, 
        relocation assistance, job search assistance, and the health 
        coverage tax credit.
            (6) Since the inception of the trade adjustment assistance 
        program, more than 5,000,000 United States workers have been 
        certified as eligible for benefits and services under the 
        program.
            (7) As of September 30, 2015, the trade adjustment 
        assistance program had served more than 2,200,000 workers.
            (8) In fiscal year 2015, the Department of Labor certified 
        413 petitions for eligibility for the trade adjustment 
        assistance program, which provided access to trade adjustment 
        assistance benefits for 57,631 workers.
            (9) In 2015, more than 13,000 new participants were 
        enrolled in the trade adjustment assistance for workers program 
        and the program provided services and benefits to more than 
        47,000 workers.
            (10) From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2015, the 
        average processing time for a petition under the trade 
        adjustment assistance for workers program was 49.1 days and the 
        average processing time for fiscal year 2015 was 47.2 days.
            (11) The trade adjustment assistance program provides vital 
        education and training services to assist trade-affected 
        workers to acquire new skills and prepare for new employment.
            (12) From 2012 through 2015, more than 9,800 steelworkers 
        and iron ore miners in 17 States lost their jobs as a result of 
        increases in imports of steel and steel products and were 
        certified as eligible to apply for the trade adjustment 
        assistance program.
            (13) In fiscal year 2015, more than 6,500 steelworkers were 
        certified as eligible for trade adjustment assistance, 
        including workers who were laid off or furloughed in 2014.
            (14) In order to empower workers who have been adversely 
        affected by foreign trade, States should have the option of 
        providing the funding for vital educational and training 
        programs for workers while their petitions for certification of 
        eligibility for trade adjustment assistance is pending.
