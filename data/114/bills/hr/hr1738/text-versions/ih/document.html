                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of 
 Homeland Security to modernize and implement the national integrated 
   public alert and warning system to disseminate homeland security 
       information and other information, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Integrated Public Alert and Warning 
System Modernization Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) numerous proven and tested technologies exist to enable 
        the Federal Government to update and modernize its 
        dissemination of public alerts and warnings;
            (2) the expected benefits of these enhancements include--
                    (A) greater security, effectiveness, reliability, 
                integration, flexibility, comprehensiveness, and 
                redundancy of the Federal Government's alert and 
                warning capabilities;
                    (B) rapid alert dissemination;
                    (C) an improved ability to notify remote locations;
                    (D) an improved ability to notify individuals with 
                disabilities; and
                    (E) the ability to geographically target and 
                deliver alerts and warnings through multiple 
                communication modes;
            (3) there is a need to test the viability of delivering 
        messages through diverse communications modes to effectively 
        alert and warn the public;
            (4) there is a need to update, modernize, and improve the 
        ability of the Federal Government to provide residents of the 
        United States with timely and effective warnings;
            (5) although significant Federal integration efforts are 
        underway, the aggregation, dissemination, and reporting system 
        necessary for effective public alert and warning will require 
        an integrated national network for flexible, reliable, secure, 
        and authenticated dissemination of emergency alerts and 
        warnings by Federal, State, local, and tribal entities that are 
        authorized to issue alerts to the public;
            (6) there is a need to ensure that alerts and warnings are 
        accessible to people with disabilities, particularly with 
        sensory disabilities; and
            (7) States and urban areas should be allowed to utilize 
        homeland security grants for the purposes of updating and 
        modernizing public alert and warning capabilities.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL INTEGRATED PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM 
              MODERNIZATION.

    (a) In General.--

        multiple communications systems and technologies, as 
        appropriate;
            ``(3) to the extent technically feasible, include in the 
        national integrated public alert and warning system the

        warning capabilities.
    ``(c) System Requirements.--The Secretary shall ensure that the

            ``(1) incorporates redundant, diverse modes to disseminate

        messages to the public so as to reach the greatest number of 
        individuals in the intended area or location;

        and individuals with disabilities, particularly sensory 
        disabilities, or other access or functional needs; and
            ``(7) is designed to improve the ability of affected
