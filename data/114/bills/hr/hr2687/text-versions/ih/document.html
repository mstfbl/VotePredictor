    (a) Authorization of Program.--
            (1) In general.--There is authorized in the Department a 
        program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial 
        application to assure the long-term, secure, and sustainable 
        supply of energy critical elements sufficient to satisfy the

        production needs of the United States. This program may be 
        carried out primarily by the Critical Materials Energy 
        Innovation Hub authorized in section 102(a).
            (2) Program activities.--The program shall focus on areas 
        that the private sector by itself is not likely to undertake 
        because of technical and financial uncertainty and support 
        activities to--
                    (A) improve methods for the extraction, processing, 
                use, recovery, and recycling of energy critical 
                elements;
                    (B) improve the understanding of the performance, 
                processing, and adaptability in engineering designs 
                using energy critical elements;
                    (C) identify and test alternative materials that 
                can be substituted for energy critical elements and 
                maintain or exceed current performance; and
                    (D) engineer and test applications that--
                            (i) use recycled energy critical elements;
                            (ii) use alternative materials; or
                            (iii) seek to minimize energy critical 
                        element content.
            (3) Expanding participation.--In carrying out the program, 
        the Secretary shall encourage multidisciplinary collaborations 
        of participants, including opportunities for students at 
        institutions of higher education.
            (4) Consistency.--The program shall be consistent with the 
        policies and programs in the National Materials and Minerals 
        Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 (30 U.S.C. 1601 et 
        seq.).
            (5) International collaboration.--In carrying out the 
        program, the Secretary shall collaborate, to the extent 
        practicable, on activities of mutual interest with the relevant 
        agencies of foreign countries with interests relating to energy 
        critical elements.
    (b) Plan.--
            (1) In general.--Within 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter, the Secretary 
        shall prepare and submit to the appropriate Congressional 
        committees a plan to carry out the program.
            (2) Specific requirements.--The plan required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include a description of--
                    (A) the research and development activities to be 
                carried out by the program during the subsequent 2 
                years;
                    (B) the expected contributions of the program to 
                the creation of innovative methods and technologies for 
                the efficient and sustainable provision of energy 
                critical elements to the domestic economy; and
                    (C) how the program is promoting the broadest 
                possible participation by academic, industrial, and 
                other contributors.
            (3) Consultation.--In preparing each plan under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary shall consult with appropriate

                            (i) serve as the repository for scientific 
                        and technical data generated by the research 
                        and development activities funded under this 
                        section;
                            (ii) assist scientists and engineers in 
                        making the fullest possible use of the Center's 
                        data holdings;
                            (iii) seek and incorporate other 
                        information on energy critical elements to

    (c) Review and Report to Congress.--An award made to operate the 
Hub shall be for a period not to exceed 5 years, after which the award 
may be renewed, subject to a rigorous merit review. A Hub already in 
existence on the date of enactment of this Act may continue to receive 
support for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of establishment 
of that Hub. Following this process, if the Secretary determines that 
award renewal for the Hub is justified, then the Secretary must submit

        to promote an adequate and stable supply of energy critical 
        elements necessary to maintain national security, economic 
        well-being, and industrial production with appropriate 
        attention to a long-term balance between resource production, 
        energy use, a healthy environment, natural resources 
        conservation, and social needs;
            (2) identify energy critical elements and establish 
        scenario modeling systems for supply problems of energy 
        critical elements;
            (3) establish a mechanism for the coordination and 
        evaluation of Federal programs with energy critical element 
        needs, including Federal programs involving research and 
        development, in a manner that complements related efforts 
        carried out by the private sector and other domestic and 
        international agencies and organizations;
            (4) promote and encourage private enterprise in the 
        development of an economically sound and stable domestic energy 
        critical elements supply chain;
