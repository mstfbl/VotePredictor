    (a) Identification of Certain Persons Who Violate the Customs 
Laws.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may publish semiannually in 
        the Federal Register a list of any producer, manufacturer, 
        supplier, seller, exporter, or other person located outside the 
        customs territory of the United States to which the 
        Commissioner has issued a penalty claim under section 592(b)(2) 
        of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2)) citing any of 
        the violations of the customs laws described in paragraph (3).
            (2) Effect of petition for remission or mitigation.--If a 
        person to which a penalty claim described in paragraph (1) is 
        issued files a petition for remission or mitigation under 
        section 618 of that Act (19 U.S.C. 1618) with respect to the 
        penalty claim, the Secretary may not include the person on a 
        list published under paragraph (1) until a final determination 
        is made under such section 618.
            (3) Violations.--
                    (A) In general.--The violations of the customs laws 
                described in this paragraph are the following:
                            (i) Using documentation, or providing 
                        documentation subsequently used by the importer 
                        of record, that indicates a false or fraudulent 
                        country of origin or source of goods described 
                        in subparagraph (B) being entered into the 
                        customs territory of the United States.
                            (ii) Using counterfeit visas, licenses, 
                        permits, bills of lading, commercial invoices, 
                        packing lists, certificates of origin, or 
                        similar documentation, or providing counterfeit 
                        visas, licenses, permits, bills of lading, 
                        commercial invoices, packing lists, 
                        certificates of origin, or similar 
                        documentation subsequently used by the importer 
                        of record, with respect to the entry into the 
                        customs territory of the United States of goods 
                        described in subparagraph (B).
                            (iii) Manufacturing, producing, supplying, 
                        or selling goods described in subparagraph (B) 
                        that are falsely or fraudulently labeled as to 
                        country of origin or source.
                            (iv) Engaging in practices that aid or abet 
                        the transshipment, through a country other than 
                        the country of origin, of goods described in 
                        subparagraph (B), in a manner that conceals the 
                        true origin of the goods or permits the evasion 
                        of quotas or duties on, or voluntary restraint 
                        agreements with respect to, imports of the 
                        goods.
                    (B) Goods described.--Goods described in this 
                subparagraph are--
                            (i) textile or apparel goods; or
                            (ii) goods subject to antidumping or 
                        countervailing duty orders under title VII of 
                        the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et 
                        seq.).
            (4) Removal from list.--Any person included on a list 
        published under paragraph (1) may petition the Secretary to be 
        removed from the list. If the Secretary finds that the person 
        has not committed any violations of the customs laws described 
        in paragraph (3) for a period of not less than 3 years after 
        the date on which the person was included on the list, the 
        Secretary shall remove the person from the list as of the next 
        publication of the list under paragraph (1).
            (5) Reasonable care required for subsequent imports.--
                    (A) Responsibility of importers and others.--After 
                a person has been included on a list published under 
                paragraph (1), the Secretary shall require any importer 
                of record entering, introducing, or attempting to 
                introduce into the commerce of the United States any 
                goods described in paragraph (3)(B) that were either 
                directly or indirectly produced, manufactured, 
                supplied, sold, exported, or transported by the person 
                on the list to show, to the satisfaction of the 
                Secretary, that such importer has exercised reasonable 
                care to ensure that those goods are accompanied by 
                documentation, packaging, and labeling that are 
                accurate as to the origin of those goods. Such 
                reasonable care shall not include reliance solely on 
                information provided by the person on the list.
                    (B) Failure to exercise reasonable care.--If the 
                Commissioner determines that an imported good is not 
                from the country claimed on the documentation 
                accompanying the good, the failure to exercise 
                reasonable care described in subparagraph (A) shall be 
                considered when the Commissioner determines whether the 
                importer of record is in violation of section 484(a) of 
                the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(a)) or 
                regulations issued under that section.
    (b) Identification of High-Risk Countries.--
            (1) In general.--The President may publish annually in the 
        Federal Register a list of countries--
                    (A) in which illegal activities have occurred 
                involving transshipped goods or activities designed to 
                evade quotas or duties of the United States on goods; 
                and
                    (B) the governments of which fail to demonstrate a 
                good faith effort to cooperate with United States 
                authorities in ceasing such activities.
            (2) Removal from list.--Any country that is on the list 
        published under paragraph (1) that subsequently demonstrates a 
        good faith effort to cooperate with United States authorities 
        in ceasing activities described in that paragraph shall be 
        removed from the list, and such removal shall be published in 
        the Federal Register as soon as practicable.
            (3) Reasonable care required for subsequent imports.--
                    (A) Responsibility of importers of record.--The 
                Secretary of Homeland Security shall require any 
                importer of record entering, introducing, or attempting 
                to introduce into the commerce of the United States 
                goods indicated, on the documentation, packaging, or 
                labeling accompanying such goods, to be from any 
                country on the list published under paragraph (1) to 
                show, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the 
                importer, consignee, or purchaser has exercised 
                reasonable care to identify the true country of origin 
                of the good.
                    (B) Failure to exercise reasonable care.--If the 
                Commissioner determines that a good described in 
                subparagraph (A) is not from the country claimed on the 
                documentation accompanying the good, the failure to 
                exercise reasonable care under that subparagraph shall 
                be considered when the Commissioner determines whether 
                the importer of record is in violation of section 
                484(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(a)) or
