                subparagraph (A), the Government shall apply for an 
                order prohibiting the disclosure of the existence or 
                contents of the relevant subpoena. An application under 
                this subparagraph may be filed in the district court of

                requirement shall remain in effect during the pendency 
                of proceedings relating to the requirement.
                    ``(C) Consideration.--A district court of the 
                United States that receives a petition under 
                subparagraph (A) or an application under subparagraph 
                (B) should rule expeditiously, and shall, subject to 
                paragraph (3), issue a nondisclosure order that 
                includes conditions appropriate to the circumstances.

        petition filed under paragraph (1) shall include a 
        certification from the Federal official who issued the subpoena 
        indicating that the absence of a prohibition of disclosure 
        under this subsection may result in--

                individual;

            ``(3) Standard.--A district court of the United States 
        shall issue a nondisclosure order or extension thereof under 
        this subsection if the court determines that there is reason to 
        believe that disclosure of the information subject to the 
        nondisclosure requirement during the applicable time period may 
        result in--
                    ``(A) endangering the life or physical safety of an 
                individual;
                    ``(B) flight from prosecution;

                investigation or unduly delaying a trial.
            ``(4) Extension.--Upon a showing that the circumstances 
        described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (3) 
        continue to exist, a district court of the United States may 
        issue an ex parte order extending a nondisclosure order imposed 
        under this subsection or under section 3486(a)(6)(A) for 
        additional periods of 180 days, or, if the court determines 
        that the circumstances necessitate a longer period of 
        nondisclosure, for additional periods which are longer than 180 
        days.
    ``(b) Closed Hearings.--In all proceedings under this section, 
subject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the 
court must close any hearing to the extent necessary to prevent an 
unauthorized disclosure of a request for records, a report, or other 
information made to any person or entity under section 3486. Petitions, 
filings, records, orders, certifications, and subpoenas must also be 
kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the 
unauthorized disclosure of a subpoena under section 3486.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 223 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by inserting 
after the item relating to section 3486 the following:
