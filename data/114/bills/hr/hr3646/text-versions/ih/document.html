To direct the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a report on the 
 designation of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign 
            terrorist organization, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``IRGC Terrorist Designation Act''.

SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 
              CORPS AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps meets the 
        criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization as 
        set forth in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
        (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
            (2) the Secretary of State should so designate Iran's 
        Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist 
        organization under such section 219.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall 
        submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--
                    (A) a detailed report on whether Iran's Islamic 
                Revolutionary Guard Corps meets the criteria for 
                designation as a foreign terrorist organization as set 
                forth in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
                    (B) if the Secretary determines that Iran's Islamic 
                Revolutionary Guard Corps does not meet the criteria 
                set forth under such section 219, a detailed 
                justification as to which criteria have not been met.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) be submitted in unclassified form, but may 
                include a classified annex; and
                    (B) be made available only in electronic form and 
                shall not be printed, except if a printed copy is 
                requested by an office of the legislative branch.
            (3) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' 
        means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee 
                on Foreign Relations, the Committee on the Judiciary, 
                the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
                Affairs, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of 
                the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Financial Services, the Committee on Foreign 
                Affairs, the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee 
                on Homeland Security, and the Permanent Select
