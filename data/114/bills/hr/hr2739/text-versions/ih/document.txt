                administered or injected by a health care provider; and
                    ``(B) not subject to any prior authorization, step 
                therapy, dollar or durational limit, copayment, 
                deductible or coinsurance that does not apply to such 
                provider-administered anticancer medications.
            ``(2) Limitation.--Paragraph (1) shall only apply to an

                killing, slowing, or preventing the growth of cancerous

        requirement of paragraph (1), make changes to benefits or

                than on intravenously administered or injected 
                anticancer medications.
            ``(4) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed--
                    ``(A) to require the use of orally administered 
                anticancer medications as a replacement for other 
                anticancer medications;
                    ``(B) to prohibit a group health plan or health 
                insurance issuer from requiring prior authorization or 
                imposing other appropriate utilization controls in 
                approving coverage for any chemotherapy; or
                    ``(C) to supersede a State law that provides 
                greater protections with respect to the coverage with 
                respect to orally administered anticancer medications 
                than is provided under this subsection.''.

        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-23(c)) is amended by
