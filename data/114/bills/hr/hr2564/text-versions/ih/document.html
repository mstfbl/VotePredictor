                                 A BILL


 
   To accelerate the adoption of smart building technologies in the 
                private sector and key Federal agencies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smart Building Acceleration Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the building sector uses more than 40 percent of the 
        energy of the Nation;
            (2) emerging building energy monitoring and control 
        technologies are enabling a transition of the building sector 
        to ``smart'' buildings that have dramatically reduced energy 
        use and improved quality of service to occupants;
            (3) an analysis of select private-sector smart buildings by 
        the Department of Energy would document the costs and benefits 
        of those emerging technologies, promote their adoption, and 
        accelerate that transition;
            (4) with over 400,000 buildings, the Federal Government is 
        the largest building owner in the United States; and
            (5) the Federal Government can also accelerate the 
        transition to smart building technologies by demonstrating and 
        evaluating emerging smart building technologies using existing 
        programs and funding to showcase selected Federal smart 
        buildings.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Program.--The term ``program'' means the smart building 
        program established under section 5(a).

                    (C) is integrated with the overall building 
                operations for control of energy generation, 
                consumption, and storage; and
                    (D) communicates with utilities and other third-
                party commercial entities where appropriate.

SEC. 4. SURVEY OF PRIVATE SECTOR SMART BUILDINGS.

    (a) Survey.--The Secretary shall conduct a survey of privately

identification of--
            (1) which advanced building technologies--
                    (A) are most cost-effective; and
                    (B) show the most promise for--
                            (i) increasing building energy savings;
                            (ii) increasing service performance to

                            (iii) reducing environmental impacts; and
            (2) any other information the Secretary determines to be 
        appropriate.

SEC. 5. FEDERAL SMART BUILDING PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a program to 
establish 1 or more smart buildings under the jurisdiction of several 
key Federal agencies, including buildings that are owned by the Federal 
Government but are commercially operated, to demonstrate the costs and 
benefits of smart buildings.
    (b) Federal Agency Described.--The key Federal agencies referred to 
in subsection (a) shall include--

of the buildings selected under this section including an 
identification of--
            (1) which advanced building technologies--
                    (A) are most cost-effective; and
                    (B) show the most promise for--
                            (i) increasing building energy savings;
                            (ii) increasing service performance to 
                        building occupants; and
