        United States.
            (2) A risk-based method for determining whether to 
        establish new international programs in new locations, given 
        resource constraints, or expand existing international programs 
        of the Department, in which personnel and resources of the 
        Department are deployed abroad for vetting and screening of 
        persons seeking to enter the United States.
            (3) Alignment with the highest Department-wide and 
        Government-wide strategic priorities of resource allocations on

            (2) The number of Department personnel deployed to each 
        location at which an international program referred to in 
        subparagraph (A) is in operation during the current and 
        preceding fiscal year.
            (3) Analysis of the impact of each international program
