SEC. 3. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.

    (a) Produce Voluntary Guidelines.--Not later than eighteen months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, subject to a 6-month extension 
that it may exercise at its discretion, the commission established in 
section 2 shall--
            (1) develop and issue voluntary guidelines for accessible 
        postsecondary electronic instructional materials, and related 
        technologies; and
            (2) in developing the voluntary guidelines, the commission 
        shall--
                    (A) establish a technical panel pursuant to 
                subsection (d) to support the commission in developing 
                the voluntary guidelines;
                    (B) develop criteria for determining which 
                materials and technologies constitute ``postsecondary 
                electronic instructional materials'' and ``related 
                technologies'' as defined in paragraphs (5) and (6) of 
                section 7;
                    (C) identify existing national and international 
                accessibility standards that are relevant to student 
                use of postsecondary electronic instructional materials 
                and related technologies at institutions of higher 
                education;
                    (D) identify and address any unique pedagogical and 
                accessibility requirements of postsecondary electronic 
                instructional materials and related technologies that 
                are not addressed, or not adequately addressed, by the 
                identified, relevant existing accessibility standards;
                    (E) identify those aspects of accessibility, and 
                types of postsecondary instructional materials and 
                related technologies, for which the commission cannot 
                produce guidelines or which cannot be addressed by 
                existing accessibility standards due to--
                            (i) inherent limitations of commercially 
                        available technologies; or
                            (ii) the challenges posed by a specific 
                        category of disability that covers a wide 
                        spectrum of impairments and capabilities which 
                        makes it difficult to assess the benefits from 
                        particular guidelines on a categorical basis;
                    (F) ensure that the voluntary guidelines are 
                consistent with the requirements of section 504 of the 
                Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and titles 
                II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 
                U.S.C. 12131 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 12181 et seq.);
                    (G) ensure that the voluntary guidelines are 
                consistent, to the extent feasible and appropriate, 
                with the technical and functional performance criteria 
                included in the national and international 
                accessibility standards identified by the commission as 
                relevant to student use of postsecondary electronic 
                instructional materials and related technologies;
                    (H) allow for the use of an alternative design or 
                technology that results in substantially equivalent or 
                greater accessibility and usability by individuals with 
                disabilities than would be provided by compliance with 
                the voluntary guidelines; and
                    (I) provide that where electronic instructional 
                materials, or related technologies, that comply fully 
                with the voluntary guidelines are not commercially 
                available, or where such compliance is not technically 
                feasible, the institution may select the product that 
                best meets the voluntary guidelines consistent with the 
                institution's business and pedagogical needs.
    (b) Produce Annotated List of Information Technology Standards.--
Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
subject to a 6-month extension that it may exercise at its discretion, 
the commission established in section 2 shall, with the assistance of 
the technical panel established under subsection (d), develop and issue 
an annotated list of information technology standards.
    (c) Supermajority Approval.--Issuance of the voluntary guidelines 
and annotated list of information technology standards shall require 
approval of at least 75 percent (at least 15) of the 19 members of the 
commission.
    (d) Establishment of Technical Panel.--Not later than 1 month after 
the Commission's first meeting, it shall appoint and convene a panel of 
12 technical experts, each of whom shall have extensive, demonstrated 
technical experience in developing, researching, or implementing 
accessible postsecondary electronic instructional materials, or related 
technologies. The commission has discretion to determine a process for 
nominating, vetting, and confirming a panel of experts that fairly 
represents the stakeholder communities on the commission. The technical 
panel shall include a representative from the United States Access 
Board.

SEC. 4. PERIODIC REVIEW AND REVISION OF VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.

    Not later than 5 years after issuance of the voluntary guidelines 
and annotated list of information technology standards described in 
subsections (a) and (b) of section 3, and every 5 years thereafter, the 
Secretary of Education shall publish a notice in the Federal Register 
requesting public comment about whether there is a need to reconstitute 
the commission to update the voluntary guidelines and annotated list of 
information technology standards to reflect technological advances, 
changes in postsecondary electronic instructional materials and related 
technologies, or updated national and international accessibility 
standards. The Secretary shall then submit a report and recommendation 
to Congress regarding whether the commission should be reconstituted.

SEC. 5. SAFE HARBOR PROTECTIONS.

    (a) Safe Harbor for Conforming Postsecondary Electronic 
Instructional Materials and Related Technologies.--An institution of 
higher education that requires, provides, or both recommends and

                    (B) the options considered, if any are available;
                    (C) the choice the institution ultimately made and 
                why;
                    (D) what auxiliary aid or service, reasonable 
                modification, or other method the institution will 
                utilize to ensure that affected students within 
                categories of disability are afforded the rights to 
                which they are entitled under section 504 of the 
                Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and titles 
                II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 
                U.S.C. 12131 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. 12181 et seq.), 
                including an equally effective opportunity to receive 
                the same educational benefit as afforded to non-
                disabled students; and
                    (E) where a student, or students, with disabilities 
                are affected by non-conforming instructional materials 
                or related technologies, what auxiliary aid or service, 
                reasonable modification, or other method the 
                institution is using to ensure the student or students 
                are afforded the rights described in subparagraph (D);

            (1) Voluntary guidelines.--It is the intent of the Congress 
        that use of the voluntary guidelines developed pursuant to this 
        Act is and should remain voluntary. The voluntary guidelines 
        shall not confer any rights or impose any obligations on 
        commission participants, institutions of higher education, or 
        other persons, except for the legal protections set forth in 
        section 5. Thus, no department or agency of the Federal 
        Government may incorporate the voluntary guidelines, whether 
        produced as a discrete document or electronic resource, into 
        regulations promulgated under any Federal law. This restriction 
        applies only to the voluntary guidelines as a discrete document 
        or resource; it imposes no limitation on Federal use of 
        standards or resources to which the voluntary guidelines may 
        refer.
            (2) Annotated list.--It is the intent of Congress that use 
        of the annotated list of information technology standards 
        developed pursuant to this Act is and should remain voluntary. 
        The Annotated List shall not confer any rights or impose any 
        obligations on Commission participants, institutions of higher 
        education, or other persons. Thus, no department or agency of 
        the Federal Government may incorporate the Annotated List, 
        whether produced as a discrete document or electronic resource 
        into regulations promulgated under the Rehabilitation Act, the 
        Americans with Disabilities Act, or any other Federal law or 
        instrumentality. This provision applies only to the Annotated 
        List as a discrete document or resource; it imposes no 
        limitation on Federal use of standards or resources to which 
        the Annotated List may refer.

        technologies'' refers to any software, applications, learning 
        management or content management systems, and hardware that an 
        institution of higher education requires, provides, or both 
        recommends and provides for student access to and use of 
        postsecondary electronic instructional materials in a 
        postsecondary instructional program.
            (7) Technical panel.--The term ``technical panel'' means a 
        group of experts with extensive, demonstrated technical
