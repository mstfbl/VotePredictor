      Subtitle B--Qualification and Use of Drug Development Tools

SEC. 2021. QUALIFICATION OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Development of new drugs has become increasingly 
        challenging and resource intensive.
            (2) Development of drug development tools can benefit the 
        availability of new medical therapies by helping to translate 
        scientific discoveries into clinical applications.
            (3) Biomedical research consortia (as defined in section 
        507(f) of section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
        Act, as added by subsection (c)) can play a valuable role in 
        helping develop and qualify drug development tools.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress should promote and facilitate a collaborative 
        effort among the biomedical research consortia described in 
        subsection (a)(3)--
                    (A) to develop, through a transparent public 
                process, data standards and scientific approaches to 
                data collection accepted by the medical and clinical 
                research community for purposes of qualifying drug 
                development tools;
                    (B) to coordinate efforts toward developing and 
                qualifying drug development tools in key therapeutic 
                areas; and
                    (C) to encourage the development of accessible 
                databases for collecting relevant drug development tool 
                data for such purposes; and
            (2) an entity seeking to qualify a drug development tool 
        should be encouraged, in addition to consultation with the 
        Secretary, to consult with biomedical research consortia and 
        other individuals and entities with expert knowledge and 
        insights that may assist the requestor and benefit the process 
        for such qualification.

and its labeling does not meet the requirements under paragraph (3) of 
such subsection, subject to paragraph (5) of such subsection.''.
    (e) Evaluation.--
            (1) Assessment.--Not later than 48 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services shall publish for public comment an assessment of the 
        program established under section 505(z) of the Federal Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by subsection (b). Such 
        assessment shall determine if the limited-use pathway 
        established under such section 505(z) has improved or is likely 
        to improve patient access to novel antibacterial or antifungal 
        treatments and assess how the pathway could be expanded to 
        cover products for serious or life-threatening diseases or 
        conditions beyond bacterial and fungal infections.
            (2) Meeting.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
        publication of such assessment, the Secretary, acting through 
        the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall hold a public meeting 
        to discuss the findings of the assessment, during which public 
        stakeholders may present their views on the success of the 
        program established under section 505(z) of the Federal Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by subsection (b), and the 
        appropriateness of expanding such program.
    (f) Expansion of Program.--If the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services determines, based on the assessment under subsection (e)(1), 
evaluation of the assessment, and any other relevant information, that 
the public health would benefit from expansion of the limited-use 
pathway established under section 505(z) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (as added by subsection (b)) beyond the drugs approved in 
accordance with such section, the Secretary may expand such limited-use 
pathway in accordance with such a determination. The approval of any 
drugs under any such expansion shall be subject to the considerations 
and requirements described in such section 505(z) for purposes of 
expansion to other serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
    (g) Monitoring.--The Public Health Service Act is amended by 
inserting after section 317T (42 U.S.C. 247b-22) the following:

``SEC. 317U. MONITORING ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIFUNGAL DRUG USE AND 
              RESISTANCE.

    ``(a) Monitoring.--The Secretary shall use an appropriate 
monitoring system to monitor--

        program under title XVIII of such Act, of telehealth services

            (3) The types of high volume procedures codes or diagnoses 
        under such title XVIII which might be suitable to the
