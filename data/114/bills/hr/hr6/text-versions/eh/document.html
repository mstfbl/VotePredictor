SEC. 1082. GLOBAL PEDIATRIC CLINICAL STUDY NETWORK SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the National Institutes of Health should encourage a 
        global pediatric clinical study network through the allocation 
        of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to supplement 
        the salaries of new and early investigators who participate in 
        the global pediatric clinical study network;
            (2) National Institutes of Health grants, contracts, or 
        cooperative agreements should be awarded, solely for the 
        purpose of supplementing the salaries of new and early 
        investigators, to entities that participate in the global 
        pediatric clinical study network;
            (3) the Food and Drug Administration should engage the 
        European Medicines Agency and other foreign regulatory entities 
        during the formation of the global pediatric clinical study 
        network to encourage their participation; and
            (4) once a global pediatric clinical study network is 
        established and becomes operational, the Food and Drug 
        Administration should continue to engage the European Medicines 
        Agency and other foreign regulatory entities to encourage and 
        facilitate their participation in the network with the goal of 
        enhancing the global reach of the network.

      Subtitle B--Qualification and Use of Drug Development Tools

SEC. 2021. QUALIFICATION OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Development of new drugs has become increasingly 
        challenging and resource intensive.
            (2) Development of drug development tools can benefit the 
        availability of new medical therapies by helping to translate 
        scientific discoveries into clinical applications.
            (3) Biomedical research consortia (as defined in section 
        507(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added by 
        subsection (c)) can play a valuable role in helping to develop 
        and qualify drug development tools.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress should promote and facilitate a collaborative 
        effort among the biomedical research consortia described in 
        subsection (a)(3)--
                    (A) to develop, through a transparent public 
                process, data standards and scientific approaches to 
                data collection accepted by the medical and clinical 
                research community for purposes of qualifying drug 
                development tools;
                    (B) to coordinate efforts toward developing and 
                qualifying drug development tools in key therapeutic 
                areas; and
                    (C) to encourage the development of accessible 
                databases for collecting relevant drug development tool 
                data for such purposes; and
            (2) an entity seeking to qualify a drug development tool 
        should be encouraged, in addition to consultation with the 
        Secretary, to consult with biomedical research consortia and 
        other individuals and entities with expert knowledge and 
        insights that may assist the requestor and benefit the process 
        for such qualification.

        may issue such regulations as may be necessary for 
        implementation of the program.

Cosmetic Act (as added by subsection (b)) beyond the drugs approved in 
accordance with such section, the Secretary may expand such limited-use

                        prevent non-serious indications that are 
                        generally used by the broader public; and
                            (iii) alternative approaches to improving 
                        such program so that the program is 
                        appropriately targeted toward providing 
                        incentives for the development of clinically 
                        important drugs that--
                                    (I) prevent or treat rare pediatric 
                                diseases; and
                                    (II) would likely not otherwise 
                                have been developed to prevent or treat 
                                such diseases.
            (2) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2017, the

to be considered interoperable, such technology must satisfy the 
following criteria:
            ``(1) Secure transfer.--The technology allows the secure 
        transfer of all electronically accessible health information to 
        and from any and all health information technology for 
        authorized use under applicable State or Federal law.
            ``(2) Complete access to health information.--The 
        technology allows for complete access, exchange, and use of all 
        electronically accessible health information for authorized use 
        under applicable State or Federal law without special effort by 
        the requestor of such health information.
            ``(3) No information blocking.--The technology is not 
        configured, set up, or implemented to information block, as 
        defined in section 3010A(d).
    ``(b) Categories for Interoperability Standards.--The categories 
described in this subsection, with respect to standards and the 
corresponding implementation specifications for determining if health 
information technology is interoperable, consistent with the criteria 
described in subsection (a), include at least categories of standards 
and implementation specifications with respect to the following:

        is amended by striking subsection (b).''.
    (h) Patient Engagement and Empowerment.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) if the strategic goals that Congress set forth in the 
        HITECH Act are to be achieved, interoperability is best 
        achieved with individuals and authorized representatives having 
        equal access to the health information of such individuals in 
        electronic format;
            (2) patients have the right to the entirety of the health 
        information of such individuals, including such information 
        contained in an electronic health record of such individuals;
            (3) such right extends to both structured and unstructured 
        data;
            (4) such right extends to authorized representatives of the 
        individual involved, such as caretakers of such individual, 
        family members of such individual, and guardians of such 
        individual; and
            (5) to further facilitate access of an individual to health 
        information of such individual--
                    (A) health care providers should not have the 
                ability to deny a request of the individual for access 
                to the entirety of such health information of such 
                individual;
                    (B) health care providers do not need the consent 
                of individuals to share personal health information of 
                such individuals with other covered entities, in 
                compliance with the HIPAA privacy regulations 
                promulgated pursuant to section 264(c) of the Health 
                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
                for the purposes of supporting patient care, except in 
                situations where consent is specifically required under 
                such regulations, such as in cases related to the 
                psychiatric records of the individual involved;
                    (C) mechanisms should be utilized that allow for 
                the bidirectional exchange of information through such 
                mechanisms as web portals, appointments, and 
                prescription refills, for the purpose of patients 
                partnering with providers to assist in managing health 
                and care;
                    (D) mechanisms described in subparagraph (C) should 
                allow for connecting individuals across the continuum 
                of care;
                    (E) an individual has the right to access the 
                health information of the individual without cost to 
                the individual;
                    (F) mechanisms described in subparagraph (C) should 
                allow for data of an individual generated by the 
                individual to be integrated into such platforms as 
                electronic health records;
                    (G) such access should be timely, in accordance 
                with the HIPAA privacy regulations described in 
                subparagraph (B), and take into account communications 
                preferences of the individual involved;
                    (H) an individual should have the right to be 
                confident that the data in the electronic health record 
                of the individual pertains to such individual; and
                    (I) the right described in subparagraph (H) will

        those who are dually eligible for the Medicare Program under 
        title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) 
        and the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C.

        be improved most in terms of quality and efficiency by the 
        expansion, in a manner that meets or exceeds the existing in-
        person standard of care under the Medicare Program under title 
        XVIII of such Act, of telehealth services under section 
        1834(m)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(m)(4)).
            (2) Activities by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
        Innovation which examine the use of telehealth services in 
        models, projects, or initiatives funded through section 1115A

            (3) The types of high-volume services (and related 
        diagnoses) under such title XVIII which might be suitable to 
        the furnishing of services via telehealth.
            (4) Barriers that might prevent the expansion of telehealth 
        services under section 1834(m)(4) of the Social Security Act

            (2) any expansion of telehealth services under the Medicare 
        Program should--
                    (A) recognize that telemedicine is the delivery of 
                safe, effective, quality health care services, by a 
                health care provider, using technology as the mode of 
                care delivery;
                    (B) meet or exceed the conditions of coverage and 
                payment with respect to the Medicare Program under 
                title XVIII unless specifically address in subsequent 
                statute, of such Act if the service were furnished in
