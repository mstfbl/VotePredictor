    This Act may be cited as the ``Pilot's Bill of Rights 2''.

SEC. 2. MEDICAL CERTIFICATION OF CERTAIN SMALL AIRCRAFT PILOTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue or revise medical certification regulations 
to ensure that an individual may operate as pilot in command of a 
covered aircraft without regard to any medical certification or proof 
of health requirement otherwise applicable under Federal law if--
            (1) the individual possesses a valid State driver's license 
        and complies with any medical requirement associated with that 
        license;
            (2) the individual is transporting not more than 5 
        passengers;
            (3) the individual is operating under visual flight rules 
        or instrument flight rules; and
            (4) the relevant flight, including each portion thereof, is 
        not carried out--
                    (A) for compensation, including that no passenger 
                or property on the flight is being carried for 
                compensation;
                    (B) at an altitude that is more than 14,000 feet 
                above mean sea level;
                    (C) outside the United States, unless authorized by 
                the country in which the flight is conducted; or
                    (D) at an indicated air speed exceeding 250 knots.
    (b) Covered Aircraft Defined.--In this section, the term ``covered 
aircraft'' means an aircraft that--
            (1) is not authorized under Federal law to carry more than 
        6 occupants; and
            (2) has a maximum certificated takeoff weight of not more 
        than 6,000 pounds.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than 5 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a 
report that describes the effect of the regulations issued or revised 
under subsection (a) and includes statistics with respect to changes in 
small aircraft activity and safety incidents.
    (d) Prohibition on Enforcement Actions.--On and after the date that 
is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator may not take an enforcement action for not holding a 
valid third-class medical certificate against a pilot of a covered 
aircraft for a flight if the pilot and the flight meet the applicable 
requirements under paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) unless 
the Administrator has published final regulations in the Federal 
Register under subsection (a).

        States district court in which the airman resides or in which

the Federal Aviation Administration under subpart C of part 183 of 
title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, to act as a representative of 
the Administrator, including an aviation medical examiner, pilot

carrying out duties pursuant to that designation and without regard to 
the individual's employer--

        with reasonable care in connection with those duties.
    (b) Fraudulent Misconduct.--This section does not relieve an

SEC. 9. LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR VOLUNTEER PILOTS THAT FLY FOR THE 
              PUBLIC BENEFIT.

    (a) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Many volunteer pilot nonprofit organizations 
                fly for public benefit and provide valuable services to 
                communities and individuals.
                    (B) In each calendar year, volunteer pilot 
                nonprofit organizations provide long-distance, no-cost 
                transportation for tens of thousands of people during 
                times of special need.
                    (C) Such nonprofit organizations are no longer able 
                to purchase liability insurance for aircraft they do 
                not own to provide liability protection at a reasonable 
                price, and therefore face a highly detrimental 
                liability risk.
                    (D) Such nonprofit organizations have supported the 
                homeland security of the United States by providing 
                volunteer pilot services during times of national 
                emergency.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to promote the 
        activities of volunteer pilot nonprofit organizations that fly 
        for public benefit and to sustain the availability of the 
        services that such nonprofit organizations provide, including 
        the following:
                    (A) Transportation at no cost to financially needy 
                medical patients for medical treatment, evaluation, and 
                diagnosis.
                    (B) Flights for humanitarian and charitable 
                purposes.
                    (C) Other flights of compassion.
    (b) Liability Protection for Volunteer Pilot Nonprofit 
Organizations That Fly for Public Benefit and to Pilots and Staff of 
Such Nonprofit Organizations.--Section 4 of the Volunteer Protection 
Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 14503) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(4)--
                    (A) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as 
                clauses (i) and (ii), respectively;
                    (B) by striking ``the harm'' and inserting ``(A) 
                except in the case of subparagraph (B), the harm'';
                    (C) in subparagraph (A)(ii), as redesignated by 
                this paragraph, by striking the period at the end and 
                inserting ``; and''; and
                    (D) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(B) the volunteer--
                            ``(i) was operating an aircraft in

                        nonprofit organization that flies for public 
                        benefit; and
                            ``(ii) was properly licensed and insured 
                        for the operation of such aircraft.''; and
            (2) in subsection (c)--

        nothing in this section''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:

        that flies for public benefit, the staff, mission coordinators,

        nonprofit organization shall not be liable for harm caused to 
        any person by a volunteer of the nonprofit organization while 
        the volunteer--

                aircraft; and
                    ``(C) has certified to the nonprofit organization 
                that the volunteer has insurance covering the 
                volunteer's operation of the aircraft.''.
