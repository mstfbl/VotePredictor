SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clarifying Congressional Intent in 
Providing for DC Home Rule Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. REPEAL OF LOCAL BUDGET AUTONOMY AMENDMENT ACT OF 2012.

    Effective with respect to fiscal year 2013 and each succeeding 
fiscal year, the Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012 (D.C. Law 
19-321) is hereby repealed, and any provision of law amended or 
repealed by such Act shall be restored or revived as if such Act had 
not been enacted into law.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF ROLES OF DISTRICT GOVERNMENT AND CONGRESS IN 
              LOCAL BUDGET PROCESS.

    (a) Clarification of Application of Federal Appropriations Process 
to General Fund.--Section 450 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act 
(sec. 1-204.50, D.C. Official Code) is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The General Fund'' 
        and inserting ``(a) In General.--The General Fund''; and

    ``(b) Application of Federal Appropriations Process.--Nothing in 
this Act shall be construed as creating a continuing appropriation of 
the General Fund described in subsection (a). All funds provided for 
the District of Columbia shall be appropriated on an annual fiscal year 
basis through the Federal appropriations process. For each fiscal year, 
the District shall be subject to all applicable requirements of 
subchapter III of chapter 13 and subchapter II of chapter 15 of title 
31, United States Code (commonly known as the `Anti-Deficiency Act'),

            (2) by striking the period at the end and inserting the 
        following: ``, or as authorizing the District of Columbia to 
        make any such change.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect as if included in the enactment of the District of Columbia Home 
Rule Act.

            Passed the House of Representatives May 25, 2016.
