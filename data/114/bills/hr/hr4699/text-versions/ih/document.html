            ``(1) In general.--In the case of an individual who is an 
        eligible individual for any month during the taxable year, 
        there shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year an 
        amount equal to the aggregate amount paid in cash during such 
        taxable year by such individual to a parental leave savings 
        account of such individual.
    ``(b) Limitations.--
            ``(1) Annual limitation for any year.--The amount allowable

        such taxable year shall be zero.
            ``(4) Denial of deduction to dependents.--No deduction 
        shall be allowed under this section to any individual with 
        respect to whom a deduction under section 151 is allowable to 
        another taxpayer for a taxable year beginning in the calendar 
        year in which such individual's taxable year begins.
            ``(5) Coordination with employer contributions.--The 
        limitation which would (but for this paragraph) apply under 
        this subsection to an individual for any taxable year shall be 
        reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate amount 
        contributed to a parental leave savings account of such 
        individual which is excludable from the taxpayer's adjusted 
        gross income for such taxable year under section 139G (and such 
        amount shall not be allowed as a deduction under subsection 
        (a)).
