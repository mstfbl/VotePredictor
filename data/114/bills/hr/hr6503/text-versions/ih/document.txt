SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Purpose.--This Act seeks to achieve a consistent standard of 
informing newly pregnant women of all services and support that are 
available to them and to ensure that such women are not abandoned. 
Women at the point of learning about an unplanned pregnancy often ask 
themselves what society will to do support them. A myriad of services 
and support is available, but often pregnant women, and even providers, 
are unaware of such services and support. The purpose of this Act is to 
ensure that newly pregnant women are aware of all the services and 
support that are available to them and this Act furthers the authority 
to make specialized grants in this regard.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Many women do not know where to turn for available 
        assistance during pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing, 
        particularly when facing financial, social, emotional, and 
        other life challenges.
            (2) Women who are pregnant and in fear of being abandoned 
        during pregnancy should have access to available local, State, 
        and Federal governmental, as well as civil society, pregnancy 
        and parenting resources.
            (3) In a study of how women in the United States face 
        challenging circumstances during pregnancy that affect a 
        woman's willingness to carry a child to term, research shows 
        that of women who do not carry their child to term--
                    (A) 44 percent are college-aged;
                    (B) 61 percent have at least one child;
                    (C) 69 percent are facing economic challenges;
                    (D) 75 percent feel they cannot afford a child; and
                    (E) 75 percent say that having a baby would 
                interfere with work, school, or the ability to care for 
                other dependents.
            (4) When a woman discovers she is pregnant while facing 
        physical, financial, social, emotional, and other life 
        challenges, the people around her can help to mitigate anxiety 
        in the face of uncertainty by providing practical support with 
        day-to-day needs associated with pregnancy, birth, and 
        motherhood, particularly in the context of her concerns about--
                    (A) family, paternity, and community support during 
                pregnancy and following the birth of a child or 
                children;
                    (B) securing opportunities that a woman may 
                require, including the completion of education that 
                leads to employment; and
                    (C) workplaces that accommodate pregnant and 
                parenting women.
            (5) Often pregnant women are unaware of the support that 
        may be available to them from private and public sources at the 
        local, State, and national levels.

           TITLE I--PREGNANCY AND PARENTING SUPPORT SERVICES

SEC. 101. PREGNANCY AND PARENTING SUPPORT SERVICES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that women 
who are pregnant and fear being abandoned under difficult life 
circumstances, and recipients of care funded through title X of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.), title XX of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.), and other Federal, State, 
and local health care programs, should be aware of the services 
available, during and after pregnancy, that will support them while 
carrying their children to live birth as well as supporting women who 
are raising their children following birth or giving their children up 
for adoption.
    (b) Support Services.--Part D of title III of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 330F as section 330F-1; and
