 To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain land and

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Arbuckle Project Maintenance Complex 
and District Office Conveyance Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE OF MAINTENANCE COMPLEX AND DISTRICT OFFICE OF THE 
              ARBUCKLE PROJECT, OKLAHOMA.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall, as soon as 
practicable, convey to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District,

the United States in and to the Maintenance Complex and District 
Office, Arbuckle Project, Oklahoma, consistent with the terms and 
conditions set forth in the Agreement between the United States and the 
Arbuckle Master Conservancy District.
    (b) Definitions.--
            (1) Agreement.--The term ``Agreement'' means the Agreement 
        between the United States and the Arbuckle Master Conservancy 
        District for Transferring Title to the Federally Owned 
        Maintenance Complex and District Office to the Arbuckle Master 
        Conservancy District (Agreement No. 14AG640141).
            (2) District office.--The term ``District Office'' means 
        the headquarters building located at 2440 East Main, Davis, 
        Oklahoma, and the approximately 0.83 acres described in the 
        Agreement.
            (3) Maintenance complex.--The term ``Maintenance Complex'' 
        means the caretakers residence, shop buildings, and any 
        appurtenances located on the lands described in the Agreement, 
        to include approximately 2.00 acres, more or less.
    (c) Liability.--Effective upon the date of conveyance of the 
Maintenance Complex and District Office under this section, the United

        and
            (2) such water district shall not be eligible to receive 
        any benefits with respect to any facility comprising that 
        Maintenance Complex and District Office, except benefits that 
        would be available to a similarly situated person with respect 
        to such a facility that is not part of a Federal reclamation 
        project.
    (e) Communication.--If the Secretary of the Interior has not 
completed the conveyance required under subsection (a) within 12 months

Congress a letter with sufficient detail that explains the reasons the 
conveyance has not been completed and stating the date by which the

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
