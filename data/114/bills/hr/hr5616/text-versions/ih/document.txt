                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the conveyance of and remove the reversionary interest of 
 the United States in certain lands in the City of Tulare, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tulare Youth Recreation and Women's 
History Enhancement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The City of Tulare requires clear title to two Parcels 
        of land within the City's business corridor.
            (2) The Parcels are part of a right-of-way granted to the 
        Railroad by the Federal Government by the Act dated July 27, 
        1866.
            (3) The Parcels, which are currently under lease to the 
        City, are currently occupied by an outdoor recreation facility 
        for youth and an historic women's club.
            (4) The City desires to improve and restore these 
        facilities but cannot absent clear title to the Parcels.
            (5) The United States retained a reversionary interest in 
        the Parcels conveyed to the Railroad in 1866 and has not 
        exercised this authority.
            (6) The Union Pacific Railroad desires to sell the Parcels 
        to the City.
            (7) Public Law 105-195 conveyed the reversionary interest 
        to all surrounding Parcels in 1998, which were conveyed by the 
        Union Pacific Railroad to the City.
