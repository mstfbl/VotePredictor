            (1) startups face common challenges as they seek to 
        transform their ideas into successful, high-growth businesses;
            (2) incubators and accelerators are new models of growth

        and teams to create viable business ventures and social 
        initiatives;
            (3) incubators and accelerators support promising startups 
        through partnerships, mentoring, and resources connecting them 
        with seasoned entrepreneurs;
            (4) the goal of an incubator or an accelerator is to help 
        create and grow young businesses by providing them with 
        necessary financial, technical, and industry support and 
        financial and technical services; and
            (5) veterans and members of the Armed Forces can amplify 
        the skills they have acquired through their service in the 
        military through entrepreneurship.
