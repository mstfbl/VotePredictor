                                 A BILL


 
To encourage and increase the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science 
    methods within the Federal Government to advance and accelerate 
 scientific research, literacy, and diplomacy, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the authority granted to Federal agencies under the 
        America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-
        358) to pursue the use of incentive prizes and challenges has 
        yielded numerous benefits;
            (2) crowdsourcing and citizen science projects have a 
        number of additional unique benefits, including accelerating 
        scientific research and data acquisition, improving science 
        literacy, and connecting citizens to the missions of Federal 
        agencies; and
            (3) granting Federal agencies the direct, explicit 
        authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will 
        encourage its appropriate use, including protection of human 
        subjects and other ethical considerations, to advance agency 
        missions and stimulate and facilitate broader public 
        participation in the innovation process, yielding numerous 
        benefits to the Federal Government and citizens who participate 
        in such projects.
