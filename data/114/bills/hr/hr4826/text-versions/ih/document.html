To authorize the Secretary of Energy to provide technical assistance to 
     the Armed Forces of the United States with respect to ongoing 
  activities of the Armed Forces to address energy resources that are 
   being utilized by the Islamic State or would be beneficial to the

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy and American Security Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Government should take appropriate 
        actions to prohibit energy production by the Islamic State and 
        the ability of the Islamic State to find markets for, 
        capitalize on, or profit from revenues related to energy 
        production;
            (2) such actions should address procurement of oil and gas 
        equipment, refining, distribution, transportation, technical 
        expertise, and the use of financial institutions to facilitate 
        such activities;
            (3) in addition to military actions, such actions should 
        include cooperation with the Department of State, the 
        Department of the Treasury, and other appropriate Federal 
        agencies to undermine the finances of the Islamic State;
            (4) energy resources can, and have, become a means of 
        harming, and financing actions counter to, the national 
        interests and security of the United States and its allies, and 
        the Department of Defense should utilize resources from across 
        the United States Government, including the Department of 
        Energy and Department of State, to counter the impact of these 
        actions; and
            (5) the national energy policy of the United States should 
        include consideration of national security.
