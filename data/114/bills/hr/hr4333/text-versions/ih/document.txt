                                 A BILL


 
To authorize expedited consideration of sanctions in the event that the 
  Government of Iran commits acts of terror or uses ballistic missile 
             technology in violation of international law.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Zero Tolerance for Terror Act''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY AND SENSE OF CONGRESS WITH RESPECT TO 
              IRANIAN ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN BALLISTIC 
              MISSILE PROLIFERATION OR TERRORISM.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States, in interpreting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), 
and any other related agreement, that--
            (1) any action by the Government of Iran to treat the 
        legitimate imposition of sanctions by the United States or its 
        international partners based on support for terrorism, abuses 
        of human rights, or Iran's ballistic missile activities as 
        grounds to cease performing on its commitments under the JCPOA 
        in whole or in part would not be valid and would be 
        inconsistent with the terms of the JCPOA; and
            (2) nothing in the JCPOA limits or curtails the ability of 
        Congress to pass additional sanctions legislation to address 
        Iranian terrorism activities, human rights violations, and 
        ballistic missile activities.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign 
        Assets Control should be fully funded to ensure strict 
        enforcement of sanctions against Iranian actors in the areas of 
        ballistic missile proliferation and terrorism, and to ensure 
        effective re-imposition of sanctions in the event of violation 
        or breach by Iran of the JCPOA; and
            (2) Iran should continue to be prohibited from undertaking 
        any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of 
        delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic 
        missile technology, and United Nations member states should 
        take all necessary measures to prevent the transfer of 
        technology or technical assistance to Iran related to such 
        activities.

SEC. 3. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF NEW TERRORISM AND MISSILE-RELATED 
              SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN.

    (a) Determination.--If the President determines that a person or 
entity--
            (1) commits an act of international terrorism, at the 
        direction of an official of the Government of Iran, that 
        threatens the security of nationals of the United States or the 
        national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United 
        States,
            (2) knowingly assists in, sponsors, or provides financial, 
        material, or technological support for, or financial or other 
        services to or in support of--
                    (A) an act described in paragraph (1),
                    (B) a foreign terrorist organization that receives 
                financial support from the Government of Iran, or
            (3) commits an act in violation of United Nations Security 
        Council Resolution 1929 before Implementation Day, or an act in 
        violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 
        after Implementation Day, to undertake any activity related to 
        ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, 
        including launches using such ballistic missile technology,
the President shall immediately notify Congress.
    (b) Qualifying Legislation Defined.--For purposes of this section, 
the term ``qualifying legislation'' means only a bill of either House 
of Congress that authorizes or requires the President to impose 
sanctions on a person or entity with respect to which the President 
notifies Congress of a determination under subsection (a).
    (c) Introduction.--During the 60-calendar day period after the 
President notifies Congress of a determination under subsection (a), 
qualifying legislation may be introduced--
            (1) in the House of Representatives, by the Majority Leader 
        or the Minority Leader; and
            (2) in the Senate, by the Majority Leader (or the Majority 
        leader's designee) or the Minority Leader (or the Minority 
        Leader's designee).
    (d) Floor Consideration in House of Representatives.--
            (1) Reporting and discharge.--If a committee of the House 
        to which qualifying legislation has been referred has not 
        reported such qualifying legislation within 10 legislative days 
        after the date of referral, that committee shall be discharged 
        from further consideration thereof.
            (2) Proceeding to consideration.--Beginning on the third 
        legislative day after each committee to which qualifying 
        legislation has been referred reports it to the House or has 
        been discharged from further consideration thereof, it shall be 
        in order to move to proceed to consider the qualifying 
        legislation in the House. All points of order against the 
        motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in order after 
        the House has disposed of a motion to proceed on the qualifying 
        legislation with regard to the same agreement. The previous 
        question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
        adoption without intervening motion. The motion shall not be 
        debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion 
        is disposed of shall not be in order.
            (3) Consideration.--The qualifying legislation shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the qualifying 
        legislation and against its consideration are waived. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the 
        qualifying legislation to final passage without intervening 
        motion except two hours of debate equally divided and 
        controlled by the sponsor of the qualifying legislation (or a 
        designee) and an opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on 
        passage of the qualifying legislation shall not be in order.
    (e) Consideration in the Senate.--
            (1) Committee referral.--Qualifying legislation introduced 
        in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Foreign 
        Relations.
            (2) Reporting and discharge.--If the Committee on Foreign 
        Relations has not reported such qualifying legislation within 
        10 session days after the date of referral of such legislation, 
        that committee shall be discharged from further consideration 
        of such legislation and the qualifying legislation shall be 
        placed on the appropriate calendar.
            (3) Proceeding to consideration.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII 
        of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any time 
        after the committee authorized to consider qualifying 
        legislation reports it to the Senate or has been discharged 
        from its consideration (even though a previous motion to the 
        same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of qualifying legislation, and all points of 
        order against qualifying legislation (and against consideration 
        of the qualifying legislation) are waived. The motion to 
        proceed is not debatable and shall be subject to a 60-vote 
        affirmative threshold for adoption. The motion is not subject 
        to a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
        which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
        order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        qualifying legislation is agreed to, the qualifying legislation 
        shall remain the unfinished business until disposed of.
            (4) Debate.--Debate on qualifying legislation, and on all 
        debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be 
        limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided 
        equally between the Majority and Minority Leaders or their 
        designees. A motion to further limit debate is in order and not 
        debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
        motion to recommit the qualifying legislation is not in order.
            (5) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur 
        immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the 
        qualifying legislation and a single quorum call at the 
        conclusion of the debate, if requested in accordance with the 
        rules of the Senate.
            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to 
        qualifying legislation shall be decided without debate.
            (7) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the Senate 
        of any veto message with respect to qualifying legislation, 
        including all debatable motions and appeals in connection with 
        such qualifying legislation, shall be limited to 10 hours, to 
        be equally divided between, and controlled by, the majority 
        leader and the Minority Leader or their designees.
    (f) Rules Relating to Senate and House of Representatives.--
            (1) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before 
        the passage by one House of qualifying legislation of that 
        House, that House receives qualifying legislation from the 
        other House, then the following procedures shall apply:
                    (A) The qualifying legislation of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee.

                House receiving the legislation--

                        the same as if no qualifying legislation had 
                        been received from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on passage shall be on the 
                        qualifying legislation of the other House.
            (2) Treatment of a bill of other house.--If one House fails 
        to introduce qualifying legislation under this section, the 
        qualifying legislation of the other House shall be entitled to 
        expedited floor procedures under this section.
            (3) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following passage 
        of the qualifying legislation in the Senate, the Senate then 
        receives a companion measure from the House of Representatives, 
        the companion measure shall not be debatable.
            (4) Application to revenue measures.--The provisions of 
        this subsection shall not apply in the House of Representatives
