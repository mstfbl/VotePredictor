                                 A BILL


 
  To eliminate the sunset date for the Veterans Choice Program of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, to expand eligibility for such program, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Freedom of Healthcare 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) All veterans who have signed up to put their life on 
        the line for the lives and liberty of the people of the United 
        States deserve the opportunity to seek health care at a 
        facility of their choice, regardless of arbitrary distance and 
        wait-time thresholds.
            (2) Logistical impediments to veterans receiving health 
        care at medical facilities of the Veterans Health 
        Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including 
        with respect to travel, wait times, and enrollment difficulty, 
        have been found to exist across all demographics of veterans 
        and are widely cited among the most common barriers to 
        receiving the health care the veterans earned.
            (3) As a result of widespread reporting on such 
        impediments, including regarding the death of 40 veterans who 
        died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix Veterans' 
        Hospital, in 2014 Congress investigated the matter and 
        confirmed that such impediments were pervasive and systemic.
            (4) As of September 30, 2014, there were approximately 
        867,000 applications by veterans to enroll in the health care 
        system of the Department, and the Inspector General of the 
        Department could not determine how long more than half of the 
        applications had been pending.
            (5) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has been unable to 
        meet the modest goal of employing one psychiatrist per 1,000 
        individual mental health patients of the Department.
            (6) The Inspector General found that approximately 70 
        percent of the hospitals of the Department in 2014 did not have 
        enough psychiatrists to meet demand.
            (7) The Inspector General found that a significant 
        proportion of the psychiatrists of the Department saw in excess 
        of 800 to 900 veterans per year and some veterans were only 
        seen once per year because of the demand.
            (8) A study by the National Institutes of Health identified 
        the lack of available female-specific medical services and wait 
        times as key barriers to female veterans seeking health care at 
        medical facilities of the Department.
            (9) The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 
        2014 (Public Law 113-146) made great strides toward providing 
        veterans with more flexibility to seek health care in the 
        setting of choice by the veteran, however, the metrics 
        established by the Act to determine which veterans were 
        eligible for such flexibility are insufficient.
            (10) Other impediments to veterans receiving health care at 
        medical facilities of the Department can include long commutes 
        on group transport, or having to cross bridges or State lines 
        to receive care.
            (11) Many veterans like the health care provided by the 
        Department and the hospitals of the Department hold particular 
        expertise in treating ailments of veterans.
            (12) Veterans should have the option to stay with the 
        Department if the veteran likes the health care system of the 
        Department.
