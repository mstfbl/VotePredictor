                accordance with this subsection, annually conduct an 
                evaluation, and make recommendations, with respect to 
                each project conducted by the Secretary for research,

                (also known as carbon capture and storage and 
                utilization technologies).
                    (B) Scope.--For purposes of this subsection, a 
                project includes any contract, lease, cooperative 
                agreement, or other similar transaction with a public

                carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration 
                technologies.
            (2) Requirements for evaluation.--In conducting an 
        evaluation of a project under this subsection, the Secretary 
        shall--
                    (A) examine if the project will allow a carbon 
                capture, utilization, and sequestration technology to 
                advance and achieve any specific goal of the project; 
                and
                    (B) evaluate and determine if the project has made 
                significant progress in advancing a carbon capture, 
                utilization, and sequestration technology.
            (3) Recommendations.--For each evaluation of a project 
        conducted under this subsection, if the Secretary determines
