        of subsection (a) and inserting the following:
    ``Sec. 102. (a) Amount and Term of Coverage.--After the expiration 
of sixty days following the date of enactment of this Act, no Federal

acquisition or construction purposes for use in any area that has been 
identified by the Administrator as an area having special flood hazards 
and in which the sale of flood insurance has been made available under 
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, unless the building or mobile 
home and any personal property to which such financial assistance 
relates is covered by flood insurance: Provided, That the amount of 
flood insurance (1) in the case of Federal flood insurance, is at least 
equal to the development or project cost of the building, mobile home, 
or personal property (less estimated land cost), the outstanding 
principal balance of the loan, or the maximum limit of Federal flood 
insurance coverage made available with respect to the particular type 
of property, whichever is less; or (2) in the case of private flood

need not exceed the outstanding principal balance of the loan and need 
not be required beyond the term of the loan. The requirement of 
maintaining flood insurance shall apply during the life of the
