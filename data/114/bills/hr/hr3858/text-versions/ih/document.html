SEC. 203. ELIGIBLE CLAIMS.

                for which the foreign state was determined not to be 
                immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the 
                United States under section 1605A, or section 
                1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect on January

        subsection.

SEC. 204. PAYMENTS.

    (a) To Whom Made.--The Special Master shall order payment from the 
Fund for each eligible claim of a United States person to that person 
or, if that person is deceased, to the personal representative of the 
estate of that person.
    (b) Timing of Initial Payments.--The Special Master shall authorize 
all initial payments to satisfy eligible claims under this title not 
later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Payments To Be Made Pro Rata.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        Special Master shall carry out subsection (a), by dividing all 
        available funds on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts 
        outstanding and unpaid on eligible claims, until all such 
        amounts have been paid in full. In the event that a United 
        States person has an eligible claim that exceeds $100 million, 
        the Special Master shall treat that claim as if it were for 
        $100 million for purposes of this section.
            (2) Minimum payments.--
                    (A) Any applicant with an eligible claim described 
                in section 203(b)(1) who has received, or is eligible 
                or scheduled to receive, any payment that is equal to, 
                or in excess of, 30 percent of the total compensatory 
                damages owed to such applicant on the applicant's claim 
                from any source other than this Fund shall not receive 
                any payment from the Fund until such time as all other 
                eligible applicants have received from the Fund an 
                amount equal to 30 percent of the compensatory damages 
                awarded to those applicants. For purposes of 
                calculating the pro rata for these payments, the 
                Special Master shall not include the total compensatory 
                damages for applicants excluded from payment by this 
                subparagraph.
                    (B) To the extent that an applicant with an 
                eligible claim has received less than 30 percent of the 
                compensatory damages owed that applicant under a final 
                judgment described in section 203(b)(1) from any source 
                other than this Fund, such applicant may apply to the 
                Special Master for the difference between the 
                percentage of compensatory damages the applicant has 
                received from other sources and the percentage of 
                compensatory damages to be awarded other eligible 
                applicants from the Fund.
    (d) Additional Payments.--On January 1 of the second calendar year 
that begins after the date of the initial payments described in 
subsection (a) if funds are available in the Fund, the Special Master 
shall authorize additional payments on a pro rata basis to those 
claimants with eligible claims under section 203(b)(1) and shall 
authorize additional payments for eligible claims annually thereafter 
if funds are available in the Fund.
    (e) Subrogation and Retention of Rights.--
            (1) United states subrogated to creditor rights to the 
        extent of payment.--The United States shall be subrogated to 
        the rights of any person who applies for and receives payments 
        under this title, but only to the extent and in the amount of 
        such payments made under this title. The President shall pursue 
        these subrogated rights as claims or offsets of the United 
        States in appropriate ways, including any negotiation process 
        that precedes the normalization of relations between the 
        foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and 
        the United States or the lifting of sanctions against such 
        foreign state.
            (2) Rights retained.--To the extent amounts of damages 
        remain unpaid and outstanding under this section, each 
        applicant shall retain that applicant's creditor rights in any 
        unpaid and outstanding amounts of the judgment, including any 
        prejudgment or post-judgment interest, or punitive damages, 
        awarded by the United States district court pursuant to a 
        judgment.

                at issue in that case to the plaintiffs, those assets 
                shall be deposited into the Fund, but only to the 
                extent, and in such percentage, that the rights, title, 
                and interest to such assets were assigned through 
                elections made pursuant to subparagraph (C).
                    (C) Election to participate in the fund.--Upon

                Master, and the chief judge of the United States 
                District Court for the Southern District of New York 
                within 60 days of the date of enactment of this Act, a 
                United States person, who is a plaintiff in the 
                proceedings captioned Petersen v. Islamic Republic of 
                Iran, No. 10 Civ. 4518 (S.D.N.Y.), or a Settling

                and interest to such person's claims to the assets at

                Fund. The Attorney General is authorized to pursue any 
                such assigned rights, title, and interest in those 
                claims for the benefit of the Fund.
                    (D) Application for conditional payment.--A United

                identified in subparagraph (C) and who does not elect 
                to participate in the Fund may, notwithstanding such

                        allocate but withhold payment to an eligible 
                        claimant who applies for a conditional payment 
                        under this paragraph until such time as an 
                        adverse final judgment is entered in both of 
                        the proceedings identified in subparagraph (C).
                            (ii) In the event that a final judgment is 
                        entered in favor of the plaintiffs in the 
                        proceedings identified in subparagraph (C), the

                        a conditional payment under this subparagraph 
                        shall be considered void, and any funds 
                        previously allocated to such conditional 
                        payments shall be made available and

    (a) In General.--Any United States person who holds a final 
judgment described in section 203(b)(1) and who meets the requirements

date of enactment of this Act pursuant to a proceeding resulting in 
forfeiture that was initiated after the date of enactment of this Act.

subsection if--
