                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             June 18, 2015

Mr. Stivers (for himself, Mr. Welch, Mr. McKinley, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. 
   Renacci, and Mr. Tiberi) introduced the following bill; which was 
            referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure that 
 eligible product developers have competitive access to approved drugs 
  and licensed biological products, so as to enable eligible product 
  developers to develop and test new products, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access for Safe and Timely 
Generics Act of 2015'' or the ``FAST Generics Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Reference product license or approval holders are 
        restricting competitive access to reference products by 
        sponsors seeking to develop drugs, generic drugs, and 
        biosimilars under section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(2) and 355(j)) and 
        under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 
        U.S.C. 262(k)). These restrictions are deterring and delaying 
        development of drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars by 
        extending lawful patent-based monopolies beyond their lawful 
        patent life.
            (2) The enforcement provisions set forth in section 505-
        1(f)(8) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
        355-1(f)(8)) have not been sufficient to prevent anti-
        competitive practices that interfere with access to reference 
        products which is necessary for the timely development of 
        affordable drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars.
            (3) There is not a regulatory structure in place that is 
        sufficient to deter or remedy the anti-competitive harm that 
        results when--
                    (A) access to reference products is restricted to 
                sponsors developing drugs, generic drugs, or 
                biosimilars in accordance with section 505(b)(2) or 
                505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
                U.S.C. 355(b)(2) or 355(j)), and section 351(k) of the 
                Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), 
                respectively; or
                    (B) license holders impede the prompt negotiation 
                and development of a single, shared system of elements 
                to assure safe use and supporting agreements under 
                section 505-1(i)(1)(B) of such Act (21 U.S.C. 355-
                1(i)(1)(B)), on commercially reasonable terms.
            (4) Requiring license holders to comply with requirements 
        for competitive access to their products, and for the 
        negotiation and development of single, shared systems of 
        elements to assure safe use under section 505-1(i)(1)(B) of the 
        Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-
        1(i)(1)(B)), and subjecting license holders to liability for 
        failing to do so, will not impose obligations on the courts 
        that they cannot adequately and reasonably adjudicate.

SEC. 3. COMPETITIVE ACCESS TO COVERED PRODUCTS FOR DEVELOPMENT 
              PURPOSES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

        mitigation strategy under section 505-1.
            ``(5) REMS product.--The term `REMS product' means a

    ``(b) Competitive Access to Covered Products as a Condition on 
Approval or Licensing.--As a condition of approval or licensure, or 
continuation or renewal of approval or licensure, of a covered product 
under section 505 of this Act or section 351 of the Public Health 
Service Act, respectively, the Secretary shall require that the covered 
product's license holder not construe or apply any condition or 
restriction relating to the sale, resale, or distribution of the 
covered product, including any condition or restriction adopted, 
imposed, or enforced as an aspect of a risk evaluation and mitigation

license holder to an eligible product developer with an applicable 
individual covered product authorization obtained pursuant to 
subsection (e) for development and testing purposes.
    ``(d) Single, Shared System of Elements To Assure Safe Use.--Where

505(j) referencing a REMS product whose REMS includes elements to 
assure safe use--

            ``(1) Competitive access to products not subject to rems 
        impacting product distribution.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, a license holder that receives a request from 
        an eligible product developer or its agent for sufficient 
        supplies of a covered product (that is not subject to a REMS 
        impacting product distribution) to conduct testing necessary to 
        support an application under section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) or 
        under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (or 
        otherwise meet the requirements for approval of such an 
        application) shall provide to the eligible product developer or 
        its agent the quantity requested within 30 days of receipt of 
        the request at a nondiscriminatory, commercially reasonable, 
        market-based price for which such covered product has been 
        previously sold by the license holder to third parties in the 
        open market.

        impacting product distribution: individual covered product 
        authorization.--Any eligible product developer may seek an 
        authorization to obtain an individual covered product subject 
        to a REMS impacting product distribution for development and 
        testing purposes by making a written request to the Secretary. 
        Within 120 days of receiving such a request, the Secretary 
        shall, by written notice, issue such authorization for purposes 
        of--

                human clinical trials, if the eligible product

                Secretary determines necessary; or
                    ``(B) development and testing that involves human

                        includes protections that will provide an 
                        assurance of safety comparable to the assurance 
                        of safety provided by any distribution 
                        restrictions governing the approval or

                Public Health Service Act, or otherwise meet the 
                requirements for approval of such application, if the 
                eligible product developer has obtained an applicable 
                authorization under paragraph (2).

        authorization under paragraph (2) to obtain the specific 
        covered product. Within 30 days of receiving such a request, 
        the wholesaler or specialty distributor shall provide the 
        requested quantity of the covered product at a non-
        discriminatory, commercially reasonable, market-based price for 
        which such covered product has been previously sold by the 
        license holder to third parties in the open market.
            ``(C) Disclosure of information by wholesalers and 
        specialty distributors.--In the event that a request is made to

        prohibit, limit, or otherwise suspend a transfer of a covered 
        product to an eligible product developer if the Secretary 
        determines that the transfer of such product to the eligible 
        product developer would present an imminent hazard to the 
        public health. In such cases, the Secretary shall specify the 
        basis for the determination, including the specific information 
        available to the Secretary which served as the basis for such 
        determination, and confirm such determination in writing.
    ``(f) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) Remedies.--An eligible product developer that is 
        aggrieved by a violation of subsection (b), (c), (d), (e)(1) or

        court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief and 
        treble damages (including costs and interest of the kind 
        described in section 4(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 
        15(a))).
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--
                    ``(A) Preservation of antitrust laws.--Nothing in 
                this Act, or the amendments made by this Act, shall be 
                construed to modify, supersede, or impair the operation 
                of the antitrust laws.
                    ``(B) Definition.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
                the term `antitrust laws' shall have the meaning given 
                such term in subsection (a) of the 1st section of the 
                Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12), except that such term shall 
                include section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act 
                (15 U.S.C. 45) to the extent that such subsection 
                applies to unfair methods of competition.
    ``(g) Limitation of Liability.--The holder of an approved 
application or license for a covered product shall not be liable for 
any claim arising out of an eligible product developer's failure to 
follow adequate safeguards to assure safe use of the covered product

section.''.
    (b) Waiver of Single, Shared System Requirement.--Section 505-
1(i)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355-
1(i)(1)(B)) is amended--
            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``or'' at the end;
            (2) in clause (ii), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting ``; or''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(iii) the applicant for an abbreviated 
                        new drug application certifies that it 
                        attempted in good faith to create or negotiate 
                        entry into a single, shared system, but was 
                        unable to finalize commercially reasonable 
                        terms with the holder of the listed drug within 
                        120 days, and such certification includes a 
                        description of the efforts made by the

    (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made by this 
section shall take effect upon enactment, and shall apply to all 
approved applications or licenses for a covered product (as defined in 
section 505-2(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as added 
by this section) regardless of whether those applications or licenses 
were approved before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act.
