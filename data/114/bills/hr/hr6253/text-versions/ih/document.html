                                 A BILL


 
     To establish an advisory commission to examine licensing and 
 certification challenges confronting members of the Armed Forces and 
 their spouses upon post-service entry into the civilian workforce and 
to make recommendations to Congress for the development of a new class 
 of uniform veteran's certifications for selected occupations that can 
          be accepted by States and United States territories.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Collaborating for 
Economic Reintegration of Troops Act'' or the ``CERT Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) One of the greatest challenges facing transitioning 
        members of the Armed Forces and their spouses is finding 
        civilian employment.
            (2) Veterans report that employment is the top challenge 
        upon separation or retirement from the Armed Forces, with as 
        many as 80 percent of members leaving the Armed Forces without 
        civilian employment in hand and one in four reporting being 
        underemployed and earning below-poverty wages.
            (3) Military training correlates to approximately 962 
        civilian professions, yet even with their military education 
        and experience, veterans must duplicate their training to meet 
        various State specific certification guidelines.
            (4) Veteran transition can be aided by establishing a 
        commission to examine licensing and certification challenges 
        confronting members of the Armed Forces upon post-service entry 
        into the civilian workforce.
            (5) This commission will identify where there are gaps 
        between military training and civilian credentials' training 
        requirements and can identify opportunities for military 
        training to be reformed to address such gaps and for transition 
        to be improved by increased recognition of military training as 
        equivalent through a ``Blue Star certification''.
            (6) The Blue Star certification initiative would set 
        sufficient standards for entry into certain licensed 
        professions. States could adopt Blue Star certifications as 
        equivalent to entry into certain licensed professions. The 
        Armed Forces, in their training process, would ensure members 
        reach Blue Star proficiency so that upon leaving service they 
        could swiftly transition to civilian employment.
            (7) Operation Certification would allow for members of the 
        Armed Forces to directly and immediately apply their training 
        and experience to the private sector. States that adopt the 
        Blue Star credential will attract and retain talented and civic 
        minded veterans. Furthermore, this would modernize military 
        training within Blue Star occupational specialties to ensure 
        that members are well trained and prepared to meet any 
        challenge upon separation.
