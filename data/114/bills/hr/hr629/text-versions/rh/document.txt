    (a) In General.--Paragraph (7) of section 1374(d) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:
            ``(7) Recognition period.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `recognition period' 
                means the 5-year period beginning with the 1st day of 
                the 1st taxable year for which the corporation was an S

                an asset and reports the income from the sale using the 
                installment method under section 453, the treatment of 
                all payments received shall be governed by the 
                provisions of this paragraph applicable to the taxable 
                year in which such sale was made.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014.
