_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
      To provide grants for high-quality prekindergarten programs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pre-K for USA Act.''

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States ranks 25th in early learning 
        enrollment with fewer than 3 out of 10 four-year-olds enrolled 
        in high-quality prekindergarten programs.
            (2) Studies show that children with access to high-quality 
        prekindergarten programs are less likely to repeat a grade or 
        drop out of high school, and more likely to succeed in their 
        careers.
            (3) Every public dollar spent on high-quality 
        prekindergarten programs returns $7 through a reduced need for 
        spending on other services such as remedial education, grade 
        repetition, and special education.
            (4) Children who attended prekindergarten are less likely 
        to develop drug problems, commit a felony, and go to prison, 
        and are half as likely to be arrested.
            (5) Children who attended prekindergarten usually have 
        higher grade point averages and are more likely to attend a 
        four-year college.
            (6) About 40 percent of school districts do not offer 
        prekindergarten programs.
            (7) Over half of school districts that have pre-
        kindergarten programs offer only part-day programs.
            (8) Texas missed out on up to $118.48 million in Federal 
        funding to expand prekindergarten programs.
            (9) Reports showed that in 2011 the Texas legislature cut 
        approximately $5.4 billion in education funding and eliminated 
        the $200 million in grants it offered to schools to expand 
        prekindergarten programs from half-day to full-day.
            (10) In response to the State of Texas' education funding 
        cuts, certain local governments took it upon themselves to fund 
        full-day prekindergarten programs.
            (11) For these reasons, certain localities, including local 
        governments and local educational agencies would benefit from 
        direct application prekindergarten Federal program funding.

SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education, in consultation with
