                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to pursue with other countries 
 the goal of the mutual elimination of government-backed export credit 
agencies, and to provide for the abolishment of the Export-Import Bank 
 of the United States if doing so would not put the United States at a 
                       competitive disadvantage.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Entering Negotiations to Dissolve 
Outdated Financial Agencies Nationalizing Export Related Activities'' 
or the ``END OF AN ERA Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Approximately 80 to 90 percent of world trade relies on 
        trade finance, and the approximate value of the global market 
        for trade finance is $10,000,000,000,000 per year.
            (2) In 2012, export credit agencies in Germany and France 
        extended roughly two-and-a-half times as much export 
        financing--measured as a share of their GDPs--as was extended 
        by the Export-Import Bank of the United States; export credit 
        agencies in China and India provided almost 3 times, and in 
        Korea provided 10 times, as much export financing as was 
        provided by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
            (3) It is estimated that there are as many as 85 export 
        credit agencies globally.
            (4) In a true free market economy, private sector financing 
        options would negate the need for an export credit agency such 
        as the Export-Import Bank of the United States.
            (5) Unilateral abolishment of the Export-Import Bank of the 
        United States would place United States manufacturing at a 
        global competitive disadvantage.
            (6) The United States historically has led efforts to 
        impose international disciplines on government-backed export 
        credit activity.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO SEEK NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE 
              MUTUAL ELIMINATION OF GOVERNMENT-BACKED EXPORT CREDIT 
              AGENCIES; ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall seek to enter into negotiations 
with other countries for the mutual elimination of government-backed 
export credit agencies.
    (b) Progress Reports.--The Secretary shall submit to the Committee 
on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate (in this Act 
referred to as the ``relevant Committees'') annual reports, in writing, 
of--
            (1) progress made in arranging negotiations described in 
        subsection (a); and
            (2) progress made in any such negotiations, including 
        whether eliminating the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
        (in this Act referred to as the ``Bank'') at the time of the 
        report would put the United States at a competitive 
        disadvantage.

SEC. 4. CERTIFICATION THAT ELIMINATING THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE 
              UNITED STATES WILL NOT PUT THE UNITED STATES AT A 
              COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE.

    On a determination by the Secretary that the Bank can be eliminated 
in a way that would not put the United States at a competitive 
disadvantage, considering job losses and a decrease in economic 
activity, the Secretary shall submit to the relevant Committees a 
certification of the determination.

SEC. 5. REDUCTIONS OF AUTHORITIES BEFORE ABOLISHMENT.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law:
            (1) Termination of authority to accept applications for 
        assistance.--The Bank may not accept an application for a loan, 
        insurance, or a guarantee, or to participate in an extension of 
        credit by another entity, after the date the Secretary provides 
        the certification described in section 4.
            (2) Termination of authority to renew or enter into a 
        contract for the provision of assistance by the bank.--The Bank 
        may not renew or enter into a contract which would obligate the 
        Bank to provide a loan, insurance, or a guarantee, or 
        participate in an extension of credit by another entity, after 
        the date the Secretary provides the certification described in 
        section 4.
    (b) Rule of Interpretation.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to extend the expiration date of any authority provided by 
section 7 of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945.

SEC. 6. ABOLISHMENT OF THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) In General.--Effective on the abolishment date:
            (1) Abolishment.--The Bank is abolished.
            (2) Transfer of functions.--All functions that, immediately 
        before the abolishment date are authorized to be performed by

        office of the Bank, are transferred to the Secretary.
    (b) Abolishment Date Defined.--In this Act, the term ``abolishment 
date'' means 180 days after the date the Secretary provides the 
certification described in section 4.

        the Bank in accordance with this Act; and

        Secretary under section 6(a)(2).
    (b) Termination of Functions.--All functions that are transferred 
to the Secretary under section 6(a)(2) shall terminate on the date all 
obligations of the Bank, and all obligations of others to the Bank, in 
effect immediately before the abolishment date have been satisfied, as 
determined by the Secretary.
    (c) Report to the Congress.--When the Secretary makes the 
determination described in subsection (b) of this section, the 
Secretary shall report the determination to the Committees referred to 
in section 3(b).

SEC. 8. DUTIES OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall be responsible for the 
implementation of this Act, including--
            (1) the administration and dissolution of all functions 
        transferred to the Secretary under section 6(a)(2);
