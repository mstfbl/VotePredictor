                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage 
 under the Medicare program of an initial comprehensive care plan for 
  Medicare beneficiaries newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and 
               related dementias, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Outcomes, Planning, and 
Education (HOPE) for Alzheimer's Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As many as half of the estimated 5,100,000 American 
        seniors with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias have never 
        received a diagnosis.
            (2) An early and documented diagnosis and access to care 
        planning services leads to better outcomes for individuals with 
        Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and their caregivers.
            (3) Building upon the existing Medicare benefit of a 
        diagnostic evaluation to add comprehensive care planning 
        services would help ensure that beneficiaries and their 
        families receive critical information about the disease and 
        available care options, which leads to better outcomes.
            (4) An accurate, timely, and documented diagnosis allows 
        for better management of other known chronic conditions and 
        more efficient utilization of medical resources, including 
        reducing complications and the number of costly emergency room 
        visits and hospitalizations.
            (5) A formal and documented diagnosis and care planning 
        services allow individuals and their caregivers to have access 
        to available medical and non-medical treatments, build a care 
        team, participate in support services, and enroll in clinical 
        trials.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide better care and 
outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias by building upon existing Medicare coverage of a 
diagnostic evaluation for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias to 
add coverage of initial comprehensive care planning services for 
Medicare beneficiaries who are first diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 
or related dementias on or after the date of the enactment of this Act 
and whose medical records contain the documented diagnosis of the 
disease.
