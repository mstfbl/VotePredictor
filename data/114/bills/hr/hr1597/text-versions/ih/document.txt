SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DESIRED TENETS OF THE DEFENSE 
              ACQUISITION SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives held a series of hearings in 2013, 2014, and 
        2015 gathering testimony from key acquisition leaders and 
        experts. It is clear that the acquisition reform efforts of the 
        last 50 years continue to founder because they fail to address 
        the motivational and environmental factors in which they must 
        be implemented. The acquisition system, though frustrating to 
        all, is in one sense in equilibrium. The acquisition system 
        provides enough benefits to proponents and opponents to 
        continue, with only minor changes, despite its shortcomings.
            (2) The Department of Defense still has too many defense 
        acquisitions and services chasing too few dollars. 
        Consequently, there remains a vast difference between the 
        budgeting plans of the Department and the reality of the cost 
        of its systems or the services it acquires. To keep programs 
        alive, the Department develops and Congress accepts fragile 
        acquisition strategies that downplay technical issues and 
        assume only successful outcomes from high-risk efforts. As a 
        result, the Department often ends up with too few weapons, with 
        performance that falls short, that are difficult and costly to 
        maintain, delivered late at too high a cost. We have limited 
        insight into the services acquired or what services need to be 
        acquired in the future. Furthermore, the conventional 
        acquisition process is not agile enough for today's demands. 
        Finally, the Department of Defense continues to struggle with 
        financial management and auditability, affecting its ability to 
        control costs, ensure basic accountability, anticipate future 
        costs and claims on the budget, and measure performance.
            (3) Too often today, all stakeholders in the Department of 
        Defense, Congress, and industry, accept that--
                    (A) for the acquisition process, success is defined 
                as maximizing technical performance or protecting 
                organizational interests, without regard to funding 
                disruptions and delivery delays of needed capability or 
                services to the warfighter; and
                    (B) the acquisition process is--
                            (i) reactive, meaning issues are addressed 
                        late and at great cost only after problems are 
                        realized;
                            (ii) plodding, meaning the bureaucratic 
                        processes are sclerotic and cumbersome;
                            (iii) opaque, meaning that limiting 
                        information is necessary to protect programs; 
                        and
                            (iv) traditional, meaning that customary 
                        approaches and suppliers are preferred over 
                        perceived risk of new or unique concepts and 
                        vendors.
            (4) Today, the United States is at a cross-roads, and if 
        changes to the acquisition system are not made soon, the trend 
        of fewer and more costly systems and services that fall short 
        of the needs of the Armed Forces will continue. Congress, the 
        Department of Defense, contractors, and the American people all 
        have a stake in making positive changes. Each plays a role in 
        contributing to the current system. Each gains benefits from 
        that system, but each is frustrated by it as well.
            (5) The acquisition improvement effort of the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives proposes a 
        different approach from previous efforts by seeking to improve 
        the environment (i.e., statutes, regulations, processes, and 
        culture) driving acquisition decisions in the Department of 
        Defense, industry, and Congress. The Committee has solicited 
        input from industry and the Department of Defense, as well as 
        others in Congress, and will continue to do so. The Committee 
        recognizes that there are no ``silver bullets'' that can 
        immediately fix the current acquisition system in a holistic 
        and long-standing manner. Therefore, the reform effort will be 
        an ongoing and iterative process that will result in 
        legislation not only this year, but will be embedded in the 
        Committee's annual and regular work.
    (b) Sense of Congress on the Tenets of an Improved Acquisition 
System.--It is the sense of Congress that all stakeholders in the 
acquisition system--the Department of Defense, Congress, and industry--
should be governed by the following tenets:
            (1) Success.--Success in the acquisition system means the 
        timely delivering of affordable and effective military 
        equipment and services.
            (2) Proactive.--The acquisition system should be proactive, 
        meaning--
                    (A) the system should recognize that development 
                and acquisition problems can occur; and
                    (B) officials at all levels should be empowered to 
                solve problems and reduce risks by surfacing issues 
                early and honestly and taking action to resolve them.
            (3) Agile.--The acquisition system should be agile, meaning 
        that needed program adjustments should be proposed and 
        adjudicated quickly.
            (4) Transparent.--The acquisition system should be 
        transparent, meaning that--
                    (A) all decisionmakers should be given useful, 
                relevant, credible, and reliable information when 
                making commitments;
                    (B) Government and industry communication should be 
                clear and open; and
                    (C) the Department of Defense should produce 
                auditable financial management statements.
            (5) Innovative.--The acquisition system should be 
        innovative, meaning that barriers should be removed that 
        preclude companies from undertaking defense business or 
        officials from proposing new approaches.

        TITLE II--WEAPON SYSTEMS ACQUISITION AND RELATED MATTERS

SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DESIRED CHARACTERISTICS FOR THE 
              WEAPON SYSTEMS ACQUISITION SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Current situation.--Despite significant and repeated 
        attempts at acquisition reform, the Department of Defense still 
        experiences case after case of expensive weapon system 
        acquisition failures. The Department of Defense has a track 
        record of too many cancellations, schedule slippages, cost 
        over-runs, and failures to deliver timely solutions to the 
        requirements of the Armed Forces. This situation is 
        unacceptable. For example, according to the Final Report of the 
        2010 Army Acquisition Review, between 1996 and 2010, the Army 
        expended approximately $1 billion to $3 billion annually on two 
        dozen programs that were eventually cancelled. No military 
        service and no type of weapon acquisition has been immune.
            (2) Problems in all phases of acquisitions.--
                    (A) Despite detailed weapon acquisition processes 
                and procedures, there is only limited discipline in 
                starting programs. Many programs begin without a solid 
                foundation. They have too many requirements deemed 
                ``critical'', which are driven by too many 
                organizations and individuals. Approved requirements 
                are often set with only a limited understanding of the 
                technical feasibility of achieving them. The resulting 
                compromises of good program management and engineering 
                judgment that allow the programs to proceed are the 
                ``spackle'' of the acquisition system that covers up 
                the risks and enables the system to operate.
                    (B) As these weapon systems proceed into 
                engineering and manufacturing development, they often 
                encounter development problems leading to cost growth, 
                schedule delay, and performance reductions. Industry 
                and Government officials frequently respond by taking 
                additional development risks to resolve basic 
                performance issues by reducing the time to analyze and 
                assess development results, overlapping key development 
                efforts, and reducing testing. The Department of 
                Defense and Congress disrupt the planned funding of 
                stable programs to find resources for troubled programs 
                or to fund across-the-board spending cuts. Funding 
                instability is the inevitable price that programs pay 
                for survival because funding disruptions actually keep 
                more programs alive.
                    (C) Finally, these weapons are often rushed into 
                production only to encounter production problems, and 
                are fielded with many unknowns or deficiencies leading 
                to significantly reduced quantities and force structure 
                reductions. The warfighter faces the challenge of 
                operating weapons with poor reliability, high 
                maintenance demands, reduced performance, and many 
                capability shortfalls.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--It is the sense of Congress that, in 
        accordance with the tenets described in section 3, to improve 
        weapon system acquisitions, the Department of Defense, 
        Congress, and industry should develop an acquisition system 
        characterized by highly disciplined program initiation coupled 
        with agile program execution and balanced oversight, as 
        described in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).
            (2) Highly disciplined program initiation.--An acquisition 
        system characterized by highly disciplined program initiation 
        means that programs do not begin engineering development until 
        firm requirements are matched to a flexible acquisition 
        strategy structured to develop militarily useful capability 
        that can be delivered in a relevant period of time with 
        available technologies, funding, and management capacity. Such 
        a highly disciplined program initiation includes--
                    (A) a workforce with smart requirements setters and 
                expert buyers, with the knowledge, skills, and 
                experience to successfully plan for and execute highly 
                complex acquisitions;
                    (B) requirements that are well-defined, technically 
                feasible, and affordable;
                    (C) acquisition strategies that are designed to 
                minimize time to market of militarily useful 
                capability, with the program concerned being structured 
                so that--
                            (i) lower-risk, technically mature 
                        capabilities are matched to delivering 
                        capability to the warfighter in the near term, 
                        while remaining requirements are aligned and 
                        resources are programmed to support integration 
                        into later increments to meet the requirements 
                        of the Armed Forces;
                            (ii) capabilities are approved for an 
                        increment only when their developmental risks 
                        have been appropriately reduced; and
                            (iii) increments are planned to complete 
                        engineering and manufacturing development in a 
                        reasonable period of time;
                    (D) a science and technology development enterprise 
                that is responsive to the acquisition process before 
                engineering and manufacturing development begins, and 
                sufficiently resourced to reduce risks and enable 
                programs to make smart decisions without losing 
                critical funds; and
                    (E) redtape reduction in order to free up program 
                and Department officials to focus on their mission of 
                defining an executable program and understanding and 
                addressing risks.
            (3) Agile program execution.--An acquisition system 
        characterized by agile program execution means a system in 
        which acquisition speed and flexibility to make trade-offs are 
        balanced with the need to achieve desired technical 
        performance. Such agile program execution includes--
                    (A) program managers and program officials who are 
                expert buyers and negotiators who anticipate problems, 
                negotiate solutions, and are empowered to manage;
                    (B) a preference for fixed price development, with 
                program initiation laying the foundation in which fixed 
                price contracting is the appropriate contract type for 
                product development;
                    (C) program managers who avoid increasing program 
                risk by resisting the addition of new requirements or 
                the reduction of developmental activities;
                    (D) empowering program managers and senior 
                decisionmakers to make decisions easily in order to 
                move forward with capabilities that mature quickly, 
                cancel those that encounter greater difficulties than 
                expected, and trade-off or reduce requirements to 
                maintain cost and schedule;
                    (E) enabling program managers to focus on 
                overcoming execution challenges and delivering success 
                rather than concentrating on compliance with reporting, 
                certifications, and other redtape; and
                    (F) senior decisionmakers who have knowledge of 
                demonstrated performance as programs proceed through 
                development, with robust developmental testing 
                occurring before committing to production for 
                operational use as a basis for decisionmaking.
            (4) Balanced oversight.--An acquisition system 
        characterized by balanced oversight means that the focus is on 
        ensuring discipline initiating programs and that appropriate 
        adjustments are made during development, so that programs have 
        the best chance to succeed. Such balanced oversight includes--
                    (A) involvement by decisionmakers early to ensure 
                that an understanding of trade-offs, risks, and needs 
                are considered, resourced, and validated, and that 
                agreement is reached between the executive and 
                legislative branches;
                    (B) acceptance by decisionmakers that complex 
                weapon system developments are inherently risky and 
                require expertise and flexibility to manage 
                effectively;
                    (C) conscious decisions by decisionmakers regarding 
                where to accept risk, while ensuring that risk 
                mitigation plans are resourced (with time, funding, 
                alternatives, and competent government and contractor 
                officials);
                    (D) measuring and monitoring by decisionmakers of 
                the right factors, such as technology maturation 
                progress and systems engineering during risk reduction, 
                development cost growth during engineering and 
                manufacturing development, and reliability growth 
                during system demonstration;
                    (E) work by Congress and the Department of Defense, 
                once a program has begun, to resolve issues by 
                considering trade-offs among cost, schedule, and 
                performance necessary to best support the warfighter; 
                and
                    (F) congressional understanding of risks and 
                efforts to mitigate such risks even if they are through 
                non-traditional means or other technological advances.
