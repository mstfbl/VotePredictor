  To provide a path to end homelessness in the United States, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ending Homelessness Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) although the United States has experienced a reduction 
        in veteran homelessness after a surge of new Federal funding 
        targeted to homeless veterans starting in fiscal year 2008, 
        major progress towards the national goals for ending 
        homelessness in our Nation has virtually stalled in the absence 
        of increased funding;
            (2) according to the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development's 2015 point-in-time count, there were 564,708 
        people experiencing homelessness in the United States on any 
        given night, including 83,170 chronically homeless individuals;
            (3) between 2014 and 2015, homelessness among major city 
        Continuum of Care programs, which account for 48 percent of all 
        homeless people in the U.S., increased by 3 percent;
            (4) homelessness in many major cities has reached crisis 
        proportions and some cities have declared that homelessness has 
        reached a state of emergency; and
            (5) the Federal Government must renew its commitment to the 
        national goals to end homelessness.

SEC. 3. EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDING.

    Title IV of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
11360 et seq) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 491 (42 U.S.C. 11408; relating 
        to rural housing stability grant program) as section 441;
            (2) by redesignating section 592 (42 U.S.C. 11408a; 
        relating to use of FMHA inventory for transitional housing for 
        homeless persons and for turnkey housing) as section 442; and
