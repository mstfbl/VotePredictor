                                 A BILL


 
To prevent the abuse of opiates, to improve response and treatment for 
  the abuse of opiates and related overdoses, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stem the Tide of Overdose Prevalence 
from Opiate Drugs Act of 2016'' or as the ``STOP OD Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The increase in fentanyl-related unintentional overdose 
        fatalities presents another life-threatening scenario for its 
        victims and threatens first-responders.
            (2) The U.S. Sentencing Commission--
                    (A) ought to consider the presence of fentanyl in 
                connection to the illicit distribution of an illicit 
                substance, as a cutting agent; and
                    (B) if fentanyl is present as a cutting agent or in 
                its pure form, may consider such presence as an 
                aggravating factor at sentencing.
            (3) Better identification and reporting practices by 
        medical examiners and coroners to identify fentanyl in an 
        overdose mortality will help the States and the Federal 
        Government to allocate resources more accurately. Those 
        findings ought to be confidential but for any aggregate data 
        released by the appropriate government agency.
            (4) Congress encourages States to expand training 
        opportunities to first responders to administer naloxone.
            (5) Eliminating the civil liability of first responders 
        administering naloxone would save lives and protect our 
        emergency personnel.

SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--For each of fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the

        naloxone in the course of their duty to counteract opiate 
        overdoses.
