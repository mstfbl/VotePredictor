    ``(f) Regulation-Specific Frameworks.--
            ``(1) In general.--Beginning 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this subsection, when an agency publishes a final 
        major rule in the Federal Register, the agency shall publish a 
        report on the benefits and costs of the final rule on entities 
        whose conduct is regulated by the rule in the Federal Register 
        biannually thereafter while the rule remains in effect. The 
        report shall--
                    ``(A) assess the impacts, including any costs, of 
                the major rule on regulated entities;
                    ``(B) include a determination about how the actual 
                benefits and costs of the major rule has varied from 
                those anticipated at the time the major rule was 
                issued;
                    ``(C) assess the effectiveness and benefits of the 
                major rule in producing the regulatory objectives of 
                the major rule; and
                    ``(D) be reviewed by the Administrator when 
                required under Executive order.
            ``(2) Report to congress.--The agency shall provide a 
        report to Congress not later than 90 days after the agency 
        makes any determination under paragraph (1)(C) that the cost to 
        regulated entities has exceeded the anticipated cost at the 
        time the final rule was issued. Agencies shall assess in their 
        report--
                    ``(A) whether the major rule is accomplishing its 
                regulatory objective; and
                    ``(B) whether the major rule has been rendered 
                unnecessary, taking into consideration--
                            ``(i) changes in the subject area affected 
                        by the major rule;
                            ``(ii) whether the major rule overlaps, 
                        duplicates, or conflicts with other rules or, 
                        to the extent feasible, State and local 
                        government regulations; and
                            ``(iii) other alternatives to the major 
                        rule or modification of the major rule could 
                        achieve better results while imposing a smaller 
                        burden on society or at a lower cost, taking 
                        into consideration any cost already incurred.
            ``(3) Reopening of public docket.--Upon delivery of the 
        report required in paragraph (2) the agency shall--
                    ``(A) reopen the public docket for 60 days to 
                receive additional comments; and
                    ``(B) consider modifications or alternatives that 
                reduce costs and increase benefits to regulated 
                entities or individuals.
            ``(4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
        be construed to affect any other provision of law that requires 
        an agency to conduct retrospective reviews of rules issued by 
        the agency.''.
