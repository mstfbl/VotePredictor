                agency to implement positive, preventative approaches 
                to exclusionary discipline actions that promote a 
                positive school climate for all students and improve 
                engagement for disconnected youth, juvenile offenders, 
                and other students, while minimizing students' removal 
                from instruction and, if students are removed, upon 
                students' return to the instructional program, 
                maximizing students' opportunities to make up education 
                lost during the period of removal from instruction;

                college and career ready by promoting student 
                engagement, and preventing dropout;

                facility, or any other residential placement within the 
                juvenile or adult criminal justice system for such 
                offense, the period of expulsion shall run concurrently
