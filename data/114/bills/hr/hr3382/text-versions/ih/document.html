SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    Section 2 of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (Public Law 106-506; 
114 Stat. 2351) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) Lake Tahoe--
                    ``(A) is one of the largest, deepest, and clearest 
                fresh-water lakes in the world;
                    ``(B) has a distinctive cobalt blue color, a 
                biologically diverse alpine setting, and remarkable 
                water clarity; and
                    ``(C) is recognized as a natural resource of 
                special significance, so that even world-traveler Mark 
                Twain called Lake Tahoe the `fairest picture the whole 
                earth affords'.
            ``(2) In addition to being a scenic and ecological 
        treasure, the Lake Tahoe Basin is one of the outstanding 
        recreational resources of the United States, which--
                    ``(A) offers skiing, water sports, biking, camping, 
                and hiking to millions of visitors each year; and
                    ``(B) contributes significantly to the economies of 
                California, Nevada, and the United States.
            ``(3) The economy in the Lake Tahoe Basin is dependent on 
        the natural beauty and recreation opportunities of Lake Tahoe 
        and the surrounding area.
            ``(4) Forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin suffer from over a 
        century of fire damage, periodic drought, and mismanagement, 
        which have resulted in--
                    ``(A) high tree density and mortality;
                    ``(B) the loss of biological diversity; and
                    ``(C) a large quantity of combustible forest fuels, 
                which significantly increases the threat of 
                catastrophic fire and insect infestation.
            ``(5) The establishment of several aquatic and terrestrial 
        invasive species (including perennial pepperweed, milfoil, and 
        Asian clam) threatens the ecosystem of the Lake Tahoe Basin, 
        and the likelihood exists for the introduction and 
        establishment of other invasive species (such as yellow 
        starthistle, New Zealand mud snail, Zebra mussel, and quagga 
        mussel).
            ``(6) 75 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe Basin is 
        administered by the Federal Government, which makes it a 
        Federal responsibility to significantly contribute to the 
        restoration of the ecological health of the Lake Tahoe Basin.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            ``(1) To identify ways and pursue options to expand the 
        environmental threshold carrying capacity of the Lake Tahoe 
        Basin.
            ``(2) To enable the Chief of the Forest Service, the 
        Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and 
        the Administrator, in cooperation with the Planning Agency and 
        the States of California and Nevada, to fund, plan, and 
        implement significant forest management and invasive species 
        control activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin.
            ``(3) To ensure that Federal, State, local, regional, 
        tribal, and private entities continue to work together to 
        manage lands and forests in the Lake Tahoe Basin.
            ``(4) To support local governments in the Lake Tahoe Basin 
        in efforts related fire risk reduction and forest management 
        activities.
            ``(5) To prioritize public recreational access to public 
        lands in the Lake Tahoe Basin.
            ``(6) To ensure that management of Federal land and forests 
        in the Lake Tahoe Basin is conducted with the understanding 
        that--
                    ``(A) public forests are renewable assets that 
                should be managed, rather than neglected, and that 
                excess timber should be harvested to generate 
                continuing revenue for care of the public's land, in 
                accordance with a good neighbor policy; and
                    ``(B) the Federal Government will defer to local 
                communities whenever possible with regard to land 
                acquisition and land regulations or restrictions.''.

subsections:
    ``(c) Forest Management Activities.--
            ``(1) Coordination.--For the purpose of increasing 
        efficiencies and maximizing the compatibility of management 
        practices across public property boundaries, in conducting 
        forest management activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin Management 
        Unit, the Secretary shall coordinate, as appropriate, with--

        Secretary shall conduct the activities in a manner that--
                    ``(A) except as provided in paragraph (3), promotes 
                multiple management benefits, including--
                            ``(i) reducing forest fuels;

        from the management activity. The Secretary shall make each 
        cost-benefit determination made under this paragraph publicly 
        available.

                conducted, in accordance with this Act, for the forest 
                management activity.
