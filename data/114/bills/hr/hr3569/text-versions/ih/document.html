 To require the Attorney General to establish a ``Good Neighbor'' code 
   of conduct for federally licensed firearms dealers, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Good Neighbor Gun Dealer Act''.

SEC. 2. GOOD NEIGHBOR CODE OF CONDUCT FOR GUN DEALERS.

    (a) Establishment.--The Attorney General shall establish a 
voluntary code of conduct for licensed dealers (which shall be known as 
the ``Good Neighbor Code of Conduct'') that shall urge licensed 
dealers, at a minimum, to--
            (1) take such steps as the Attorney General specifies in 
        the code of conduct to--
                    (A) prevent the dealer from selling a firearm to a 
                straw purchaser, gun trafficker, criminal, or other 
                individual prohibited by law from purchasing a firearm; 
                and
                    (B) maintain a well-trained, responsible, law-
                abiding workforce;
            (2) implement a safety plan to detect and deter firearm 
        theft from the licensed dealer;
            (3) cooperate fully with all law enforcement 
        investigations, and notify law enforcement of suspected straw 
        purchasers of firearms; and
            (4) ensure that a background check is completed before the 
        sale of any firearm.
    (b) Publication.--Within 6 months after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Attorney General shall cause to be published on the 
website of the Department of Justice the code of conduct established 
under subsection (a).

SEC. 3. GOOD NEIGHBOR CERTIFICATION FOR GUN DEALERS.

    (a) Creation.--The Attorney General shall create a ``Good 
Neighbor'' certification for licensed dealers who agree to abide by the 
code of conduct established under section 2.
    (b) Report to the Congress.--Within 6 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall report to the 
Congress on the process for awarding the certification created under 
subsection (a).
    (c) Revocation.--The Attorney General, in the sole discretion of 
the Attorney General, may revoke a certification granted under this 
section, for failure to abide by the code of conduct established under 
section 2.
    (d) Publication.--The Attorney General shall cause to be published 
on the website of the Department of Justice a full list of licensed 
dealers to whom a Good Neighbor certification has been granted under 
this section, and shall provide that list to the Congress annually.

SEC. 4. DISCLOSURE OF FIREARM TRACE DATA.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General 
may disclose firearms trace data to the public, to the extent that 
doing so will not undermine an investigation or, in the judgement of 
the Attorney General, otherwise compromise the efforts of law 
enforcement or public safety.

SEC. 5. STRATEGIC PLAN.

    Within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
Senate a strategic plan detailing the efforts to be made by the 
Attorney General to--
            (1) improve the accuracy, reliability and comprehensiveness 
        of firearms trace data;
            (2) enhance the identification of licensed dealers who have 
        transferred firearms that have been disproportionately used in 
        the commission of crime; and
            (3) increase enforcement against violations of Federal law 
        by licensed dealers.

SEC. 6. DEFINITION OF LICENSED DEALER.

    In this Act, the term ``licensed dealer'' has the meaning given in 
section 921(a)(11) of title 18, United States Code.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
