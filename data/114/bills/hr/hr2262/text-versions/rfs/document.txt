SEC. 102. INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH COMPETITIVENESS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide for 
updating the methodology used to calculate the maximum probable loss 
from claims under section 50914 of title 51, United States Code, with a 
validated risk profile approach to provide reasonable maximum probable 
loss values associated with potential third party losses from 
commercially licensed launches. An appropriately updated methodology 
will help ensure that the Federal Government is not exposed to greater 
financial risks than intended and that launch companies are not 
required to purchase more insurance coverage than necessary.
    (b) Maximum Probable Loss Plan.--Not later than 180 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall 
provide to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a plan to update the methodology used to 
calculate maximum probable loss from claims under section 50914 of 
title 51, United States Code, through the use of a validated risk 
profile approach. Such plan shall include, at a minimum--
            (1) an evaluation of the reasonableness of the current 
        single casualty estimate and, if needed, the steps the 
        Secretary will take to update such estimate;
            (2) an evaluation, in consultation with the Administrator 
        of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
        heads of other relevant executive agencies, of the 
        reasonableness of the dollar value of the insurance requirement 
        required by the Secretary for launch providers to cover damage 
        to Government property resulting from a commercially licensed 
        space launch activity, and recommendations as to a reasonable 
        calculation if, as determined by the Secretary, the current 
        statutory threshold is insufficient;
            (3) a schedule of when updates to the methodology and 
        calculations for the totality of the Maximum Probable Loss will 
        be implemented, and a detailed explanation of any changes to 
        the current calculation; and
            (4) consideration of the impact of the cost of its 
        implementation on the licensing process, both in terms of the 
        cost to industry of collecting and providing the requisite data 
        and cost to the Government of analyzing the data.
    (c) Independent Assessment.--Not later than 270 days after 
transmittal of the plan under subsection (b), the Comptroller General 
shall provide to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate an assessment of--
            (1) the conclusions and analysis provided by the Secretary 
        of Transportation in the plan required under subsection (b);
            (2) the implementation schedule proposed by the Secretary 
        in such plan;
            (3) the suitability of the plan for implementation; and
            (4) any further actions needed to implement the plan or 
        otherwise accomplish the purpose of this section.
    (d) Launch Liability Extension.--Section 50915(f) of title 51, 
United States Code, is amended by striking ``December 31, 2016'' and 
inserting ``December 31, 2025''.

        debris requirements under treaties and other international 
        agreements to which the United States is a signatory, and other 
        nonbinding international arrangements in which the United 
        States participates, and the manner in which the Federal 
        Government complies with those requirements.
            (4) An assessment of existing Federal Government assets 
        used to conduct space traffic management and space situational 
        awareness.
            (5) An assessment of the risk associated with smallsats as 
        well as any necessary Government coordination for their launch 
        and utilization.
            (6) An assessment of existing private sector information 
        sharing activities associated with space situational awareness 
        and space traffic management.
            (7) Recommendations related to the framework for the 
        protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public and 
        economic vitality of the space industry.

enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall provide to the Committee 
on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate 
the report required in subsection (b).
    (d) Department of Defense Authorities.--Congress recognizes the 
vital and unique role played by the Department of Defense in protecting 
national security assets in space. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to amend authorities granted to the Department of Defense to 
safeguard the national security.

SEC. 110. STATE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH FACILITIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that State 
involvement, development, ownership, and operation of launch facilities 
can help enable growth of the Nation's commercial suborbital and 
orbital space endeavors and support both commercial and Government 
space programs. It is further the sense of Congress that State launch 
facilities and the people and property within the affected launch areas 
of those State facilities are subject to risks if the commercial launch 
vehicle fails or experiences an anomaly. To ensure the success of the 
commercial launch industry and the safety of the people and property in 
the affected launch areas, it is the further sense of Congress that 
States and State launch facilities should seek to take proper measures 
to secure their investments and the safety of third parties from 
potential damages that could be suffered from commercial launch 
activities.
    (b) Report Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the 
Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a report on the potential inclusion of all 
government property, including State and municipal property, in the 
existing indemnification regime established under section 50914 of 
title 51, United States Code.

SEC. 111. SPACE SUPPORT VEHICLES STUDY.

    Not less than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, a report on the 
use of space support vehicle services in the commercial space industry. 
This report shall include--
            (1) the extent to which launch providers rely on such 
        services as part of their business models;
            (2) the statutory, regulatory, and market barriers to the 
        use of such services; and
            (3) recommendations for legislative or regulatory action 
        that may be needed to ensure reduced barriers to the use of 
        such services if such use is a requirement of the industry.

SEC. 112. STREAMLINE COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH ACTIVITIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
eliminating duplicative requirements and approvals for commercial 
launch and reentry operations will promote and encourage the 
development of the commercial space sector.
    (b) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the Secretary 
of Transportation, in overseeing and coordinating commercial launch and 
reentry operations, should--
            (1) promote commercial space launches and reentries by the 
        private sector;
            (2) facilitate Government, State, and private sector 
        involvement in enhancing U.S. launch sites and facilities;
            (3) protect public health and safety, safety of property, 
        national security interests, and foreign policy interests of 
        the United States; and
            (4) consult with the head of another executive agency, 
        including the Secretary of Defense or the Administrator of the

                        satisfaction of a requirement of another 
                        agency; and
                            (ii) resolve any inconsistencies and remove 
                        any outmoded or duplicative requirements or 
                        approvals of the Federal Government relevant to
