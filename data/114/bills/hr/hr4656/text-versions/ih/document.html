close or consolidate any postal facility (as that term is defined in 
section 404(f)(5) of title 39, United States Code, as added by

    (b) Process for Closing and Consolidating Processing Facilities.--
Section 404 of title 39, United States Code, is amended by adding at

the facility;
    ``(B) an analysis of the effect of the closure or consolidation on

        dominant products;
            ``(ii) affected community, including any disproportionate 
        impact on a State, region, or locality;
            ``(iii) travel times and distances for affected customers 
        to access postal services;

which the facility is located that may have a unique effect, including 
remoteness, broadband internet availability, and weather-related 
obstacles to using alternative postal facilities; and
    ``(E) any other factor the Postal Service determines necessary.
    ``(3) The Postmaster General shall publish--

        the public.
    ``(4) If the Postal Service makes a determination to close or 
consolidate a postal facility after completing the requirements of

        Congress and the Postal Regulatory Commission;
            ``(B) provide adequate public notice of the intention to

        notification (in multiple languages where necessary), within 30 
        days after the date notice is provided under subparagraph (A), 
        to each person in the zip code served by such postal facility;
            ``(C) during the period of 120 days beginning on the date 
        that is 30 days after the date notice is provided under 
        subparagraph (A), ensure that interested persons have an 
        opportunity to submit public comments;
            ``(D) prior to the period described in subparagraph (C),

        conduct at least 3 public meetings located within the area 
        affected by the closing or consolidation that provides an 
        opportunity for public comments to be submitted verbally or in 
        writing.

        consolidate the facility; and
            ``(B) a justification statement that includes--

                under paragraph (4);
                    ``(ii) the considerations made by the Postal 
                Service under such paragraph; and

        Service's response and notice, as described in such paragraphs; 
        and
            ``(ii) approve or disapprove of the closure or 
        consolidation.
    ``(B) If the Commission disapproves the closure or consolidation,
