    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall 
promulgate regulations with respect to video visitation service, and 
amend its regulations with respect to inmate calling service (as 
necessary), to ensure that all charges, practices, classifications, and

inmate calling service are just and reasonable.
    (b) Requirements for Regulations.--The regulations promulgated 
under subsection (a) shall include the following:
            (1) Caps on the rates (and any related fees or charges) 
        that a provider of a covered service may charge for such 
        service.
            (2) A prohibition against a provider of a covered service 
        charging a flat rate for a call, regardless of the duration of 
        the call.
            (3) A prohibition against a provider of a covered service 
        requiring a correctional facility to restrict in-person 
        visitation as a condition of providing such service in such 
        facility.
            (4) A requirement that a provider of a covered service 
        certify annually to the Commission that such provider is in 
        compliance with the prohibition under paragraph (3). If such 
        provider is subject to the annual reporting and certification 
        requirement of section 64.6060 of title 47, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, the certification required under this paragraph 
        shall be included as part of the certification required by such 
        section.
            (5) A prohibition against a provider of a covered service 
        offering or entering into an agreement to provide a covered 
        service as part of a bundle of services that includes any 
        service that is not a communications service.
            (6) Requirements for the offering or entering into an 
        agreement to provide a covered service as part of a bundle of 
        services that ensure that correctional facilities are able to 
        review each service separately during the request for proposals 
        process.
            (7) With respect to video visitation service, quality 
        standards that are the best commercially available for 
        effective human communication by video. In developing such 
        standards, the Commission shall seek comments that review the 
        academic literature regarding the appropriate thresholds for 
        effective human communication by video.
    (c) Applicability.--The regulations promulgated under subsection 
(a) shall apply to interstate service, intrastate service, and 
international service. In promulgating such regulations, the Commission 
may provide for different requirements for interstate service, 
intrastate service, and international service.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Call.--The term ``call'' means a voice or video call 
        using a covered service. Such term includes any other session 
        of use that is similar to a telephone call.
            (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal 
        Communications Commission.
            (3) Covered service.--The term ``covered service'' means an 
        inmate calling service or a video visitation service.
            (4) Video visitation service.--The term ``video visitation 
        service'' means a service that allows inmates to make video 
        calls to individuals outside the correctional facility where 
        the inmate is being held, regardless of the technology used to 
        deliver the service. A video visitation service may be 
        classified as an inmate calling service, as the Commission 
        considers appropriate.
            (5) Additional definitions from regulations.--The terms 
        ``correctional facility'', ``inmate'', and ``inmate calling 
        service'' have the meanings given such terms in section 64.6000 
        of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.
