SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) As established in the Proclamation of a State of 
        Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, 
        2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions.
            (2) Extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State 
        since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist 
        into the future.
            (3) The water supplies of the State are at record-low 
        levels, as indicated by the fact that all major Central Valley 
        Project reservoir levels were at 20-35 percent of capacity as 
        of September 25, 2014.
            (4) The lack of precipitation has been a significant 
        contributing factor to the 6,091 fires experienced in the State 
        as of September 15, 2014, and which covered nearly 400,000 
        acres.
            (5) According to a study released by the University of 
        California, Davis in July 2014, the drought has led to the 
        fallowing of 428,000 acres of farmland, loss of $810 million in 
        crop revenue, loss of $203 million in dairy and other livestock 
        value, and increased groundwater pumping costs by $454 million. 
        The statewide economic costs are estimated to be $2.2 billion, 
        with over 17,000 seasonal and part-time agricultural jobs lost.
            (6) CVPIA Level II water deliveries to refuges have also 
        been reduced by 25 percent in the north of Delta region, and by 
        35 percent in the south of Delta region.
            (7) Only one-sixth of the usual acres of rice fields are 
        being flooded this fall, which leads to a significant decline 
        in habitat for migratory birds and an increased risk of disease 
        at the remaining wetlands due to overcrowding of such birds.
            (8) The drought of 2013 through 2014 constitutes a serious 
        emergency that poses immediate and severe risks to human life 
        and safety and to the environment throughout the State.
            (9) The serious emergency described in paragraph (4) 
        requires--
                    (A) immediate and credible action that respects the 
                complexity of the water system of the State and the 
                importance of the water system to the entire State; and
                    (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against 
                one another, which history shows only leads to costly 
                litigation that benefits no one and prevents any real 
                solutions.
            (10) Data on the difference between water demand and 
        reliable water supplies for various regions of California south 
        of the Delta, including the San Joaquin Valley, indicate there 
        is a significant annual gap between reliable water supplies to 
        meet agricultural, municipal and industrial, groundwater, and 
        refuges water needs within the Delta Division, San Luis Unit 
        and Friant Division of the Central Valley Project and the State 
        Water Project south of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta 
        and the demands of those areas. This gap varies depending on 
        the methodology of the analysis performed, but can be 
        represented in the following ways:
                    (A) For Central Valley Project South-of-Delta water 
                service contractors, if it is assumed that a water 
                supply deficit is the difference in the amount of water 
                available for allocation versus the maximum contract 
                quantity, then the water supply deficits that have 
                developed from 1992 to 2014 as a result of legislative 
                and regulatory changes besides natural variations in 
                hydrology during this timeframe range between 720,000 
                and 1,100,000 acre-feet.
                    (B) For Central Valley Project and State Water 
                Project water service contractors south of the Delta 
                and north of the Tehachapi mountain range, if it is 
                assumed that a water supply deficit is the difference 
                between reliable water supplies, including maximum 
                water contract deliveries, safe yield of groundwater, 
                safe yield of local and surface supplies and long-term 
                contracted water transfers, and water demands, 
                including water demands from agriculture, municipal and 
                industrial and refuge contractors, then the water 
                supply deficit ranges between approximately 2,500,000 
                to 2,700,000 acre-feet.
            (11) Data of pumping activities at the Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project delta pumps identifies that, on 
        average from Water Year 2009 to Water Year 2014, take of Delta 
        smelt is 80 percent less than allowable take levels under the 
        biological opinion issued December 15, 2008.
            (12) Data of field sampling activities of the Interagency 
        Ecological Program located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
        Estuary identifies that, on average from 2005 to 2013, the 
        program ``takes'' 3,500 delta smelt during annual surveys with 
        an authorized ``take'' level of 33,480 delta smelt annually--
        according to the biological opinion issued December 9, 1997.
            (13) In 2015, better information exists than was known in 
        2008 concerning conditions and operations that may or may not 
        lead to high salvage events that jeopardize the fish 
        populations, and what alternative management actions can be 
        taken to avoid jeopardy.
            (14) Alternative management strategies, removing non-native 
        species, enhancing habitat, monitoring fish movement and 
        location in real-time, and improving water quality in the Delta 
        can contribute significantly to protecting and recovering these 
        endangered fish species, and at potentially lower costs to 
        water supplies.
            (15) Resolution of fundamental policy questions concerning 
        the extent to which application of the Endangered Species Act 
        of 1973 affects the operation of the Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project is the responsibility of Congress.

    (a) Review and Modification.--Not later than October 1, 2016, and 
at least every five years thereafter, the Director, in cooperation with 
other Federal, State, and local agencies, shall use the best scientific 
and commercial data available to complete a review and, modify the 
method used to calculate the incidental take levels for adult and 
larval/juvenile Delta smelt in the smelt biological opinion that takes 
into account all life stages, among other considerations--
            (1) salvage information collected since at least 1993;

        factors affecting Delta smelt salvage.
    (b) Modified Incidental Take Level.--Unless the Director determines 
in writing that one or more of the requirements described in paragraphs 
(1) through (4) are not appropriate, the modified incidental take level 
described in subsection (a) shall--
            (1) be normalized for the abundance of prespawning adult 
        Delta smelt using the Fall Midwater Trawl Index or other index;
            (2) be based on a simulation of the salvage that would have 
        occurred from 1993 through 2012 if OMR flow has been consistent 
        with the smelt biological opinions;
            (3) base the simulation on a correlation between annual 
        salvage rates and historic water clarity and OMR flow during 
        the adult salvage period; and
            (4) set the incidental take level as the 80 percent upper 
        prediction interval derived from simulated salvage rates since 
        at least 1993.

SEC. 103. FACTORING INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND UPDATED SCIENCE 
              INTO DELTA SMELT MANAGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Director shall use the best scientific and 
commercial data available to implement, continuously evaluate, and 
refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable and prudent alternative 
described in the smelt biological opinion, and any successor opinions 
or court order. The Secretary shall make all significant decisions 
under the smelt biological opinion, or any successor opinions that 
affect Central Valley Project and State Water Project operations, in 
writing, and shall document the significant facts upon which such 
decisions are made, consistent with section 706 of title 5, United 
States Code.
    (b) Increased Monitoring To Inform Real-Time Operations.--The 
Secretary shall conduct additional surveys, on an annual basis at the 
appropriate time of the year based on environmental conditions, in 
collaboration with other Delta science interests.
            (1) In implementing this section, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) use the most accurate survey methods available 
                for the detection of Delta smelt to determine the 
                extent that adult Delta smelt are distributed in 
                relation to certain levels of turbidity, or other 
                environmental factors that may influence salvage rate; 
                and
                    (B) use results from appropriate survey methods for 
                the detection of Delta smelt to determine how the 
                Central Valley Project and State Water Project may be 
                operated more efficiently to minimize salvage while 
                maximizing export pumping rates without causing a 
                significant negative impact on the long-term survival 
                of the Delta smelt.
            (2) During the period beginning on December 1, 2015, and 
        ending March 31, 2016, and in each successive December through 
        March period, if suspended sediment loads enter the Delta from 
        the Sacramento River and the suspended sediment loads appear 
        likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old River north of the 
        export pumps from values below 12 Nephelometric Turbidity Units 
        (NTU) to values above 12 NTU, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate 
                survey methods at locations including, but not limited 
                to, the vicinity of Station 902 to determine the extent 
                that adult Delta smelt are moving with turbidity toward 
                the export pumps; and
                    (B) use results from the monitoring surveys 
                referenced in paragraph (A) to determine how increased 
                trawling can inform daily real-time Central Valley 
                Project and State Water Project operations to minimize 
                salvage while maximizing export pumping rates without 
                causing a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt.
    (c) Periodic Review of Monitoring.--Within 12 months of the date of 
enactment of this title, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) evaluate whether the monitoring program under 
        subsection (b), combined with other monitoring programs for the 
        Delta, is providing sufficient data to inform Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project operations to minimize salvage 
        while maximizing export pumping rates without causing a 
        significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the 
        Delta smelt; and
            (2) determine whether the monitoring efforts should be 
        changed in the short or long term to provide more useful data.
    (d) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--
            (1) In general.--No later than January 1, 2016, and at 
        least every five years thereafter, the Secretary, in 
        collaboration with the California Department of Fish and 
        Wildlife, the California Department of Water Resources, public 
        water agencies, and other interested entities, shall implement 
        new targeted sampling and monitoring specifically designed to 
        understand Delta smelt abundance, distribution, and the types 
        of habitat occupied by Delta smelt during all life stages.
            (2) Sampling.--The Delta smelt distribution study shall, at 
        a minimum--
                    (A) include recording water quality and tidal data;
                    (B) be designed to understand Delta smelt 
                abundance, distribution, habitat use, and movement 
                throughout the Delta, Suisun Marsh, and other areas 
                occupied by the Delta smelt during all seasons;
                    (C) consider areas not routinely sampled by 
                existing monitoring programs, including wetland 
                channels, near-shore water, depths below 35 feet, and 
                shallow water; and
                    (D) use survey methods, including sampling gear, 
                best suited to collect the most accurate data for the 
                type of sampling or monitoring.
    (e) Scientifically Supported Implementation of OMR Flow 
Requirements.--In implementing the provisions of the smelt biological 
opinion, or any successor biological opinion or court order, pertaining 
to management of reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) consider the relevant provisions of the biological 
        opinion or any successor biological opinion;
            (2) to maximize Central Valley project and State Water 
        Project water supplies, manage export pumping rates to achieve 
        a reverse OMR flow rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second unless 
        information developed by the Secretary under paragraphs (3) and 
        (4) leads the Secretary to reasonably conclude that a less 
        negative OMR flow rate is necessary to avoid a negative impact 
        on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt. If information 
        available to the Secretary indicates that a reverse OMR flow 
        rate more negative than -5,000 cubic feet per second can be 
        established without an imminent negative impact on the long-
        term survival of the Delta smelt, the Secretary shall manage 
        export pumping rates to achieve that more negative OMR flow 
        rate;
            (3) document in writing any significant facts about real-
        time conditions relevant to the determinations of OMR reverse 
        flow rates, including--
                    (A) whether targeted real-time fish monitoring in 
                the Old River pursuant to this section, including 
                monitoring in the vicinity of Station 902, indicates 
                that a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt is imminent; and
                    (B) whether near-term forecasts with available 
                salvage models show under prevailing conditions that 
                OMR flow of -5,000 cubic feet per second or higher will 
                cause a significant negative impact on the long-term 
                survival of the Delta smelt;
            (4) show in writing that any determination to manage OMR 
        reverse flow at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet per 
        second is necessary to avoid a significant negative impact on 
        the long-term survival of the Delta smelt, including an 
        explanation of the data examined and the connection between 
        those data and the choice made, after considering--
                    (A) the distribution of Delta smelt throughout the 
                Delta;
                    (B) the potential effects of documented, quantified 
                entrainment on subsequent Delta smelt abundance;
                    (C) the water temperature;
                    (D) other significant factors relevant to the 
                determination; and
                    (E) whether any alternative measures could have a 
                substantially lesser water supply impact; and
            (5) for any subsequent biological opinion, make the showing 
        required in paragraph (4) for any determination to manage OMR 
        reverse flow at rates less negative than the most negative 
        limit in the biological opinion if the most negative limit in 
        the biological opinion is more negative than -5,000 cubic feet 
        per second.
    (f) Memorandum of Understanding.--No later than December 1, 2015, 
the Commissioner and the Director will execute a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) to ensure that the smelt biological opinion is 
implemented in a manner that maximizes water supply while complying 
with applicable laws and regulations. If that MOU alters any procedures 
set out in the biological opinion, there will be no need to reinitiate 
consultation if those changes will not have a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival on listed species and the 
implementation of the MOU would not be a major change to implementation 
of the biological opinion. Any change to procedures that does not 
create a significant negative impact on the long-term survival to 
listed species will not alter application of the take permitted by the 
incidental take statement in the biological opinion under section 
7(o)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
    (g) Calculation of Reverse Flow in OMR.--Within 90 days of the 
enactment of this title, the Secretary is directed, in consultation 
with the California Department of Water Resources to revise the method 
used to calculate reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers for 
implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the smelt 
biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, and any 
succeeding biological opinions, for the purpose of increasing Central 
Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies. The method of 
calculating reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers shall be reevaluated 
not less than every five years thereafter to achieve maximum export 
pumping rates within limits established by the smelt biological 
opinion, the salmonid biological opinion, and any succeeding biological 
opinions.

SEC. 202. PROCESS FOR ENSURING SALMONID MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO NEW 
              SCIENCE.

    (a) General Directive.--The reasonable and prudent alternative 
described in the salmonid biological opinion allows for and anticipates 
adjustments in Central Valley Project and State Water Project operation 
parameters to reflect the best scientific and commercial data currently 
available, and authorizes efforts to test and evaluate improvements in 
operations that will meet applicable regulatory requirements and 
maximize Central Valley Project and State Water Project water supplies 
and reliability. Implementation of the reasonable and prudent 
alternative described in the salmonid biological opinion shall be 
adjusted accordingly as new scientific and commercial data are 
developed. The Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator shall fully 
utilize these authorities as described below.
    (b) Annual Reviews of Certain Central Valley Project and State 
Water Project Operations.--No later than December 31, 2016, and at 
least annually thereafter:
            (1) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant 
        Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments to the 
        initiation of Action IV.2.3 as set forth in the Biological 
        Opinion and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of 
        the Central Valley Project and State Water Project, Endangered 
        Species Act Section 7 Consultation, issued by the National 
        Marine Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, pertaining to 
        negative OMR flows, subject to paragraph (5).
            (2) The Commissioner, with the assistance of the Assistant 
        Administrator, shall examine and identify adjustments in the 
        timing, triggers or other operational details relating to the 
        implementation of pumping restrictions in Action IV.2.1 
        pertaining to the inflow to export ratio, subject to paragraph 
        (5).
            (3) Pursuant to the consultation and assessments carried 
        out under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the 
        Commissioner and the Assistant Administrator shall jointly make 
        recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior and to the 
        Secretary on adjustments to project operations that, in the 
        exercise of the adaptive management provisions of the salmonid 
        biological opinion, will reduce water supply impacts of the 
        salmonid biological opinion on the Central Valley Project and 
        the California State Water Project and are consistent with the 
        requirements of applicable law and as further described in 
        subsection (c).
            (4) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Interior shall 
        direct the Commissioner and Assistant Administrator to 
        implement recommended adjustments to Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project operations for which the conditions under 
        subsection (c) are met.
            (5) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall 
        review and identify adjustments to Central Valley Project and 
        State Water Project operations with water supply restrictions 
        in any successor biological opinion to the salmonid biological 
        opinion, applying the provisions of this section to those water 
        supply restrictions where there are references to Actions 
        IV.2.1 and IV.2.3.
    (c) Implementation of Operational Adjustments.--After reviewing the 
recommendations under subsection (b), the Secretary of the Interior and 
the Secretary shall direct the Commissioner and the Assistant 
Administrator to implement those operational adjustments, or any 
combination, for which, in aggregate--
            (1) the net effect on listed species is equivalent to those 
        of the underlying project operational parameters in the 
        salmonid biological opinion, taking into account both--
                    (A) efforts to minimize the adverse effects of the 
                adjustment to project operations; and
                    (B) whatever additional actions or measures may be 
                implemented in conjunction with the adjustments to 
                operations to offset the adverse effects to listed 
                species, consistent with (d), that are in excess of the 
                adverse effects of the underlying operational 
                parameters, if any; and
            (2) the effects of the adjustment can be reasonably 
        expected to fall within the incidental take authorizations.
    (d) Evaluation of Offsetting Measures.--When examining and 
identifying opportunities to offset the potential adverse effect of 
adjustments to operations under subsection (c)(1)(B), the Commissioner 
and the Assistant Administrator shall take into account the potential 
species survival improvements that are likely to result from other 
measures which, if implemented in conjunction with such adjustments, 
would offset adverse effects, if any, of the adjustments. When 
evaluating offsetting measures, the Commissioner and the Assistant 
Administrator shall consider the type, timing and nature of the adverse 
effects, if any, to specific species and ensure that the measures 
likely provide equivalent overall benefits to the listed species in the 
aggregate, as long as the change will not cause a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.
    (e) Framework for Examining Opportunities To Minimize or Offset the 
Potential Adverse Effect of Adjustments to Operations.--Not later than 
December 31, 2015, and every five years thereafter, the Assistant 
Administrator shall, in collaboration with the Director of the 
California Department of Fish and Wildlife, based on the best 
scientific and commercial data available and for each listed salmonid 
species, issue estimates of the increase in through-Delta survival the 
Secretary expects to be achieved--
            (1) through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
        specified by Action IV.2.3 as compared to limiting OMR flow to 
        a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second within the time 
        period Action IV.2.3 is applicable, based on a given rate of 
        San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and holding other 
        relevant factors constant;
            (2) through San Joaquin River inflow to export restrictions 
        on export pumping rates specified within Action IV.2.1 as 
        compared to the restrictions in the April/May period imposed by 
        the State Water Resources Control Board decision D-1641, based 
        on a given rate of San Joaquin River inflow to the Delta and 
        holding other relevant factors constant;
            (3) through physical habitat restoration improvements;
            (4) through predation control programs;
            (5) through the installation of temporary barriers, the 
        management of Cross Channel Gates operations, and other 
        projects affecting flow in the Delta;
            (6) through salvaging fish that have been entrained near 
        the entrance to Clifton Court Forebay;
            (7) through any other management measures that may provide 
        equivalent or better protections for listed species while 
        maximizing export pumping rates without causing a significant 
        negative impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid 
        species; and
            (8) through development and implementation of conservation 
        hatchery programs for salmon and steelhead to aid in the 
        recovery of listed salmon and steelhead species.
    (f) Survival Estimates.--
            (1) To the maximum extent practicable, the Assistant 
        Administrator shall make quantitative estimates of survival 
        such as a range of percentage increases in through-Delta 
        survival that could result from the management measures, and if 
        the scientific information is lacking for quantitative 
        estimates, shall do so on qualitative terms based upon the best 
        available science.
            (2) If the Assistant Administrator provides qualitative 
        survival estimates for a species resulting from one or more 
        management measures, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent 
        feasible, rank the management measures described in subsection 
        (e) in terms of their most likely expected contribution to 
        increased through-Delta survival relative to the other 
        measures.
            (3) If at the time the Assistant Administrator conducts the 
        reviews under subsection (b), the Secretary has not issued an 
        estimate of increased through-Delta survival from different 
        management measures pursuant to subsection (e), the Secretary 
        shall compare the protections to the species from different 
        management measures based on the best scientific and commercial 
        data available at the time.
    (g) Comparison of Adverse Consequences for Alternative Management 
Measures of Equivalent Protection for a Species.--
            (1) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection 
        (c)--
                    (A) the alternative management measure or 
                combination of alternative management measures 
                identified in paragraph (2) shall be known as the 
                ``equivalent alternative measure'';
                    (B) the existing measure or measures identified in 
                subparagraphs (2) (A), (B), (C), or (D) shall be known 
                as the ``equivalent existing measure''; and
                    (C) an ``equivalent increase in through-Delta 
                survival rates for listed salmonid species'' shall mean 
                an increase in through-Delta survival rates that is 
                equivalent when considering the change in through-Delta 
                survival rates for the listed salmonid species in the 
                aggregate, and not the same change for each individual 
                species, as long as the change in survival rates will 
                not cause a significant negative impact on the long-
                term survival of a listed salmonid species.
            (2) As part of the reviews of project operations pursuant 
        to subsection (b), the Assistant Administrator shall determine 
        whether any alternative management measures or combination of 
        alternative management measures listed in subsection (e) (3) 
        through (8) would provide an increase in through-Delta survival 
        rates for listed salmonid species that is equivalent to the 
        increase in through-Delta survival rates for listed salmonid 
        species from the following:
                    (A) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
                specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to limiting OMR 
                flow to a fixed rate of -5,000 cubic feet per second 
                within the time period Action IV.2.3 is applicable.
                    (B) Through restrictions on export pumping rates as 
                specified by Action IV.2.3, as compared to a 
                modification of Action IV.2.3 that would provide 
                additional water supplies, other than that described in 
                subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export 
                restrictions on export pumping rates specified within 
                Action IV.2.1, as compared to the restrictions in the 
                April/May period imposed by the State Water Resources 
                Control Board decision D-1641.
                    (D) Through San Joaquin River inflow to export 
                restrictions on export pumping rates specified within 
                Action IV.2.1, as compared to a modification of Action 
                IV.2.1 that would reduce water supply impacts of the 
                salmonid biological opinion on the Central Valley 
                Project and the California State Water Project, other 
                than that described in subparagraph (C).
            (3) If the Assistant Administrator identifies an equivalent 
        alternative measure pursuant to paragraph (2), the Assistant 
        Administrator shall determine whether--
                    (A) it is technically feasible and within Federal 
                jurisdiction to implement the equivalent alternative 
                measure;
                    (B) the State of California, or subdivision 
                thereof, or local agency with jurisdiction has 
                certified in writing within 10 calendar days to the 
                Assistant Administrator that it has the authority and 
                capability to implement the pertinent equivalent 
                alternative measure; or
                    (C) the adverse consequences of doing so are less 
                than the adverse consequences of the equivalent 
                existing measure, including a concise evaluation of the 
                adverse consequences to other affected interests.
            (4) If the Assistant Administrator makes the determinations 
        in subparagraph (3)(A) or (3)(B), the Commissioner shall adjust 
        project operations to implement the equivalent alternative 
        measure in place of the equivalent existing measure in order to 
        increase export rates of pumping to the greatest extent 
        possible while maintaining a net combined effect of equivalent 
        through-Delta survival rates for the listed salmonid species.
    (h) Tracking Adverse Effects Beyond the Range of Effects Accounted 
for in the Salmonid Biological Opinion and Coordinated Operation With 
the Delta Smelt Biological Opinion.--
            (1) Among the adjustments to the project operations 
        considered through the adaptive management process under this 
        section, the Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner 
        shall--
                    (A) evaluate the effects on listed salmonid species 
                and water supply of the potential adjustment to 
                operational criteria described in subparagraph (B); and
                    (B) consider requiring that before some or all of 
                the provisions of Actions IV.2.1. or IV.2.3 are imposed 
                in any specific instance, the Assistant Administrator 
                show that the implementation of these provisions in 
                that specific instance is necessary to avoid a 
                significant negative impact on the long-term survival 
                of a listed salmonid species.
            (2) The Assistant Administrator, the Director, and the 
        Commissioner, in coordination with State officials as 
        appropriate, shall establish operational criteria to coordinate 
        management of OMR flows under the smelt and salmonid biological 
        opinions, in order to take advantage of opportunities to 
        provide additional water supplies from the coordinated 
        implementation of the biological opinions.
            (3) The Assistant Administrator and the Commissioner shall 
        document the effects of any adaptive management decisions 
        related to the coordinated operation of the smelt and salmonid 
        biological opinions that prioritizes the maintenance of one 
        species at the expense of the other.
    (i) Real-Time Monitoring and Management.--Notwithstanding the 
calendar based triggers described in the salmonid biological opinion 
Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA), the Assistant Administrator 
and the Commissioner shall not limit OMR reverse flow to -5,000 cubic 
feet per second unless current monitoring data indicate that this OMR 
flow limitation is reasonably required to avoid a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival of a listed salmonid species.
    (j) Evaluation and Implementation of Management Measures.--If the 
quantitative estimates of through-Delta survival established by the 
Secretary for the adjustments in subsection (b)(2) exceed the through-
Delta survival established for the RPAs, the Secretary shall evaluate 
and implement the management measures in subsection (b)(2) as a 
prerequisite to implementing the RPAs contained in the Salmonid 
Biological Opinion.
    (k) Accordance With Other Law.--Consistent with section 706 of 
title 5, United States Code, decisions of the Assistant Administrator 
and the Commissioner described in subsections (b) through (j) shall be 
made in writing, on the basis of best scientific and commercial data 
currently available, and shall include an explanation of the data 
examined at the connection between those data and the decisions made.

SEC. 203. NON-FEDERAL PROGRAM TO PROTECT NATIVE ANADROMOUS FISH IN THE 
              STANISLAUS RIVER.

    (a) Establishment of Nonnative Predator Fish Removal Program.--The 
Secretary and the districts, in consultation with the Director, shall 
jointly develop and conduct a nonnative predator fish removal program 
to remove nonnative striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, 
black bass, and other nonnative predator fish species from the 
Stanislaus River. The program shall--
            (1) be scientifically based;
            (2) include methods to quantify the number and size of 
        predator fish removed each year, the impact of such removal on 
        the overall abundance of predator fish, and the impact of such 
        removal on the populations of juvenile anadromous fish found in 
        the Stanislaus River by, among other things, evaluating the 
        number of juvenile anadromous fish that migrate past the rotary 
        screw trap located at Caswell;
            (3) among other methods, use wire fyke trapping, portable 
        resistance board weirs, and boat electrofishing; and
            (4) be implemented as quickly as possible following the 
        issuance of all necessary scientific research.
    (b) Management.--The management of the program shall be the joint 
responsibility of the Secretary and the districts. Such parties shall 
work collaboratively to ensure the performance of the program, and 
shall discuss and agree upon, among other things, changes in the 
structure, management, personnel, techniques, strategy, data 
collection, reporting, and conduct of the program.
    (c) Conduct.--
            (1) In general.--By agreement between the Secretary and the 
        districts, the program may be conducted by their own personnel, 
        qualified private contractors hired by the districts, personnel 
        of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service, or a combination thereof.
            (2) Participation by the national marine fisheries 
        service.--If the districts elect to conduct the program using 
        their own personnel or qualified private contractors hired by 
        them in accordance with paragraph (1), the Secretary may assign 
        an employee of, on loan to, or otherwise assigned to the 
        National Marine Fisheries Service, to be present for all 
        activities performed in the field. Such presence shall ensure 
        compliance with the agreed-upon elements specified in 
        subsection (b). The districts shall pay the cost of such 
        participation in accordance with subsection (d).
            (3) Timing of election.--The districts shall notify the 
        Secretary of their election on or before October 15 of each

SEC. 303. OPERATION OF CROSS-CHANNEL GATES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the 
Interior shall jointly--
            (1) authorize and implement activities to ensure that the 
        Delta Cross Channel Gates remain open to the maximum extent 
        practicable using findings from the United States Geological 
        Survey on diurnal behavior of juvenile salmonids, timed to 
        maximize the peak flood tide period and provide water supply 
        and water quality benefits for the duration of the drought 
        emergency declaration of the State, and for the period of time 
        such that in any year that the Sacramento Valley index is 6.5 
        or lower, or at the request of the State of California, and 
        until two succeeding years following either of those events 
        have been completed where the final Sacramento Valley Index is 
        7.8 or greater, consistent with operational criteria and 
        monitoring criteria set forth into the Order Approving a 
        Temporary Urgency Change in License and Permit Terms in 
        Response to Drought Conditions of the California State Water

    (b) Recommendations.--After assessing the information collected 
under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall recommend 
revisions to the operation of the Delta Cross-Channel Gates, to the 
Central Valley Project, and to the State Water Project, including, if 
appropriate, any reasonable and prudent alternative contained in the 
biological opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service on 
June 4, 2009, that are likely to produce water supply benefits without 
causing a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the 
listed fish species within the Delta or on water quality.

SEC. 304. FLEXIBILITY FOR EXPORT/INFLOW RATIO.

    For the period of time such that in any year that the Sacramento 
Valley index is 6.5 or lower, or at the request of the State of 
California, and until two succeeding years following either of those 
events have been completed where the final Sacramento Valley Index is 
7.8 or greater, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation shall 
continue to vary the averaging period of the Delta Export/Inflow ratio 
pursuant to the California State Water Resources Control Board decision 
D1641--
            (1) to operate to a 35-percent Export/Inflow ratio with a 
        3-day averaging period on the rising limb of a Delta inflow 
        hydrograph; and

        limb of the Delta inflow hydrograph.

SEC. 305. EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS.

    (a) NEPA Compliance.--To minimize the time spent carrying out 
environmental reviews and to deliver water quickly that is needed to 
address emergency drought conditions in the State during the duration 
of an emergency drought declaration, the Secretaries shall, in carrying 
out this Act, consult with the Council on Environmental Quality in 
accordance with section 1506.11 of title 40, Code of Federal 
Regulations (including successor regulations), to develop alternative 
arrangements to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) during the emergency.
    (b) Determinations.--For the purposes of this section, a Secretary 
may deem a project to be in compliance with all necessary environmental 
regulations and reviews if the Secretary determines that the immediate 
implementation of the project is necessary to address--
            (1) human health and safety; or
            (2) a specific and imminent loss of agriculture production 
        upon which an identifiable region depends for 25 percent or 
        more of its tax revenue used to support public services 
        including schools, fire or police services, city or county 
        health facilities, unemployment services or other associated 
        social services.

        Resources and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 
        implement offsite upstream projects in the Delta and upstream 
        of the Sacramento River and San Joaquin basins that offset the 
        effects on species listed as threatened or endangered under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) due to 
        activities carried out pursuant this Act, as determined by the 
        Secretaries;
            (2) manage reverse flow in the Old and Middle Rivers at 
        -6,100 cubic feet per second if real-time monitoring indicates 
        that flows of -6,100 cubic feet per second or more negative can 
        be established for specific periods without causing a 
        significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the 
        Delta smelt, or if real-time monitoring does not support flows 
        of -6,100 cubic feet per second than manage OMR flows at -5,000 
        cubic feet per second subject to section 103(e) (3) and (4); 
        and
            (3) use all available scientific tools to identify any 
        changes to real-time operations of the Bureau of Reclamation, 
        State, and local water projects that could result in the 
        availability of additional water supplies.

SEC. 307. TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR FIRST FEW STORMS OF THE 
              WATER YEAR.

    (a) In General.--Consistent with avoiding a significant negative 
impact on the long-term survival in the short term upon listed fish 
species beyond the range of those authorized under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 and other environmental protections under 
subsection (e), the Secretaries shall authorize the Central Valley 
Project and the State Water Project, combined, to operate at levels 
that result in negative OMR flows at -7,500 cubic feet per second 
(based on United States Geological Survey gauges on Old and Middle 
Rivers) daily average for 56 cumulative days after October 1 as 
described in subsection (c).
    (b) Days of Temporary Operational Flexibility.--The temporary 
operational flexibility described in subsection (a) shall be authorized 
on days that the California Department of Water Resources determines 
the daily average river flow of the Sacramento River is at, or above, 
17,000 cubic feet per second as measured at the Sacramento River at 
Freeport gauge maintained by the United States Geologic Survey.
    (c) Compliance With Endangered Species Act Authorizations.--In 
carrying out this section, the Secretaries may continue to impose any 
requirements under the smelt and salmonid biological opinions during 
any period of temporary operational flexibility as they determine are 
reasonably necessary to avoid an additional significant negative 
impacts on the long-term survival of a listed fish species beyond the 
range of those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
provided that the requirements imposed do not reduce water supplies 
available for the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.
    (d) Other Environmental Protections.--
            (1) State law.--The Secretaries' actions under this section 
        shall be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements 
        under State law.
            (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of 
        sediment out of the Delta in each water year, and provided that 
        such determination is based upon objective evidence, OMR flow 
        may be managed at rates less negative than -5,000 cubic feet 
        per second for a minimum duration to avoid movement of adult 
        Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) to areas in the southern 
        Delta that would be likely to increase entrainment at Central 
        Valley Project and State Water Project pumping plants.
            (3) Applicability of opinion.--This section shall not 
        affect the application of the salmonid biological opinion from 
        April 1 to May 31, unless the Secretary of Commerce finds that 
        some or all of such applicable requirements may be adjusted 
        during this time period to provide emergency water supply 
        relief without resulting in additional adverse effects beyond 
        those authorized under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In 
        addition to any other actions to benefit water supply, the 
        Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce shall 
        consider allowing through-Delta water transfers to occur during 
        this period if they can be accomplished consistent with section 
        3405(a)(1)(H) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. 
        Water transfers solely or exclusively through the State Water 
        Project are not required to be consistent with section 
        3405(a)(1)(H) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.
            (4) Monitoring.--During operations under this section, the 
        Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with the Fish and 
        Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, and 
        California Department of Fish and Wildlife, shall undertake a 
        monitoring program and other data gathering to ensure 
        incidental take levels are not exceeded, and to identify 
        potential negative impacts and actions, if any, necessary to 
        mitigate impacts of the temporary operational flexibility to 
        species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
        U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).
    (e) Technical Adjustments to Target Period.--If, before temporary 
operational flexibility has been implemented on 56 cumulative days, the 
Secretaries operate the Central Valley Project and the State Water 
Project combined at levels that result in OMR flows less negative than 
-7,500 cubic feet per second during days of temporary operational 
flexibility as defined in subsection (c), the duration of such 
operation shall not be counted toward the 56 cumulative days specified 
in subsection (a).
    (f) Emergency Consultation; Effect on Running Averages.--
            (1) If necessary to implement the provisions of this 
        section, the Commissioner is authorized to take any action 
        necessary to implement this section for up to 56 cumulative 
        days. If during the 56 cumulative days the Commissioner 
        determines that actions necessary to implement this section 
        will exceed 56 days, the Commissioner shall use the emergency 
        consultation procedures under the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 and its implementing regulation at section 402.05 of title 
        50, Code of Federal Regulations, to temporarily adjust the 
        operating criteria under the biological opinions--
                    (A) solely for extending beyond the 56 cumulative 
                days for additional days of temporary operational 
                flexibility--
                            (i) no more than necessary to achieve the 
                        purposes of this section consistent with the 
                        environmental protections in subsections (d) 
                        and (e); and
                            (ii) including, as appropriate, adjustments 
                        to ensure that the actual flow rates during the 
                        periods of temporary operational flexibility do 
                        not count toward the 5-day and 14-day running 
                        averages of tidally filtered daily OMR flow 
                        requirements under the biological opinions, or
                    (B) for other adjustments to operating criteria or 
                to take other urgent actions to address water supply 
                shortages for the least amount of time or volume of 
                diversion necessary as determined by the Commissioner.
            (2) Following the conclusion of the 56 cumulative days of 
        temporary operational flexibility, or the extended number of 
        days covered by the emergency consultation procedures, the 
        Commissioner shall not reinitiate consultation on these 
        adjusted operations, and no mitigation shall be required, if 
        the effects on listed fish species of these operations under 
        this section remain within the range of those authorized under 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). If 
        the Commissioner reinitiates consultation, no mitigation 
        measures shall be required.
    (g) Level of Detail Required for Analysis.--In articulating the 
determinations required under this section, the Secretaries shall fully 
satisfy the requirements herein but shall not be expected to provide a 
greater level of supporting detail for the analysis than feasible to 
provide within the short timeframe permitted for timely decisionmaking 
in response to changing conditions in the Delta.

                                the ability of the agency to meet any 
                                requirements under Federal, State, or 
                                local law;

                                project, requires additional analysis 
                                for the agency to make a decision on 
                                the project application; or

                review and Bureau of Reclamation project delivery 
                activities at the earliest practicable time to avoid 
                delays and duplication of effort later in the process, 
                prevent potential conflicts, and ensure that planning 
                and project development decisions reflect environmental

        memoranda of agreement with the project sponsor, Indian tribes, 
        State and local governments, and other appropriate entities to 
        carry out the early coordination activities, including 
        providing technical assistance in identifying potential impacts 
        and mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.

        authority that a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, 
        Indian tribe, or project sponsor has with respect to carrying

        The manner of conversion under this paragraph shall be as 
        follows:
                    (A) Water service contracts that were entered into 
                under section 9(e) of the Act of August 4, 1939 (53 
                Stat. 1196), to be converted under this section shall

            (2) Prepayment.--Except for those repayment contracts under 
        which the contractor has previously negotiated for prepayment, 
        all repayment contracts under section 9(d) of that Act (53 
        Stat. 1195) in effect on the date of enactment of this Act at 
        the request of the contractor, and all contracts converted 
        pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) shall--
                    (A) provide for the repayment, either in lump sum 
                or by accelerated prepayment, of the remaining 
                construction costs identified in water project specific 
                irrigation rate repayment schedules, as adjusted to 
                reflect payment not reflected in such schedule, and 
                properly assignable for ultimate return by the 
                contractor, or if made in approximately equal 
                installments, no later than 3 years after the effective

                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days following receipt of request of the 
                contractor;
                    (B) require that construction costs or other

                capital costs to the contractors exercising contract 
                conversation under this subsection of less than 
                $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 or greater, 
                such cost shall be repaid as provided by applicable 
                reclamation law;

                available to aid in repayment of construction costs 
                allocated to irrigation under the contract; and

                project specific municipal and industrial rate 
                repayment schedules, as adjusted to reflect payments 
                not reflected in such schedule, and properly assignable 
                for ultimate return by the contractor. An estimate of 
                the remaining construction costs, as adjusted, shall be 
                provided by the Secretary to the contractor no later 
                than 90 days after receipt of request of contractor.

                properly assignable to such contractor, shall be repaid 
                in not more than 5 years after notification of the 
                allocation if such amount is a result of a collective 
                annual allocation of capital costs to the contractors 
                exercising contract conversation under this subsection 
                of less than $5,000,000. If such amount is $5,000,000 
                or greater, such cost shall be repaid as provided by

        paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall--
                    (A) not be adjusted on the basis of the type of

                association;
                    (B) conform to any other agreements, such as

                relationships of the water users' association and their 
                landowners as provided under State law.
    (b) Accounting.--The amounts paid pursuant to subsection (a) shall 
be subject to adjustment following a final cost allocation by the 
Secretary of the Interior. In the event that the final cost allocation
