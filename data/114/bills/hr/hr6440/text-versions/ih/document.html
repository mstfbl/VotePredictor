SEC. 2. RESTITUTION IN THE CASE OF TRAFFICKING IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY 
              CONVICTIONS.

    (a) Restitution in the Case of Trafficking in Child Pornography 
Convictions.--Section 2259(b) of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``The order'' and inserting 
                ``Except as provided in paragraph (2), the order''; and
                    (B) by striking ``as determined by the court 
                pursuant to paragraph (2)'' after ``of the victim's 
                losses'';
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:
            ``(2) Restitution for trafficking in child pornography 
        convictions.--In the case of a conviction for trafficking in 
        child pornography, the order of restitution under this section 
        shall direct the defendant to pay the victim (through the 
        appropriate court mechanism) an amount of restitution 
        determined by the court as follows:
                    ``(A) Full amount of victim's losses determined.--
                The court shall first determine the full amount of the 
                victim's losses that were incurred or reasonably 
                projected to be incurred by the victim as a result of 
                the trafficking in child pornography on or after the 
                date of the conduct constituting the offense.
                    ``(B) Termination of payment.--A victim's total 
                aggregate recovery pursuant to this section shall not 
                exceed the full amount of the victim's proven losses. 
                After the victim has received restitution in the full 
                amount of the victim's losses as measured by the 
                greatest amount of such losses found, in any case 
                involving that victim that has resulted in a final 
                restitution under this section, the liability of each 
                defendant who is or has been ordered to pay restitution 
                for such losses to that victim shall be terminated. The 
                court may direct the victim to provide information 
                concerning the amount of restitution the victim has 
                been paid in other cases for the same losses.'';
            (3) by striking paragraph (3); and
            (4) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3).

        following:

        case'' and inserting ``under this chapter. In the case'';
            (4) by inserting after ``or any other person appointed as 
        suitable by the court,'' the following: ``may assume the crime 
        victim's rights under this section,''; and
            (5) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Trafficking in child pornography.--For purposes of 
        this section and section 2259A, the term `trafficking in child 
        pornography' means conduct proscribed by section 2251(d), 
        section 2252, paragraphs (1) though (5) of section 2252A(a), 
        section 2252A(g) (in cases in which the series of felony 
        violations exclusively involves violations of section 2251(d), 
        2252, 2252A(a)(1)-(5), or 2260(b)), or section 2260(b).
            ``(3) Child pornography production.--For purposes of this

        series of felony violations involves at least one violation of 
        such subsections), or section 2260(a).
            ``(4) Full amount of the victim's losses.--For purposes of 
        this section, the term `full amount of the victim's losses' 
        includes any costs incurred, or reasonably projected to be 
        incurred in the future, by the victim, as a proximate result of 
        the offense of conviction or, in the case of a trafficking in 
        child pornography conviction, as a proximate result of all 
        trafficking in child pornography offenses involving the same 
        victim, including--
                    ``(A) medical services relating to physical, 
                psychiatric, or psychological care;
                    ``(B) physical and occupational therapy or 
                rehabilitation;

                victim.''.
    (c) Fixed Compensation.--Section 2259 of title 18, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) Choice To Receive Fixed Compensation.--
            ``(1) Fixed compensation made available at victim's 
        election.--
                    ``(A) Election to receive compensation.--A victim 
                of trafficking in child pornography may opt to receive 
                fixed compensation from the Child Pornography Victims' 
                Fund. The court must first make a finding that the 
                claimant is a victim of trafficking in child 
                pornography. Upon such a finding and a determination by 
                the victim to receive fixed compensation, the court 
                shall order payment in accordance with subparagraph (B) 
                to the victim from the Child Pornography Victims' Fund.
                    ``(B) Amount of compensation.--The amount of 
                compensation payable is equal to--
                            ``(i) for calendar year 1st effective year, 
                        $35,000; and

                        $35,000 multiplied by the ratio (not less than 
                        1) of--
                                    ``(I) the Consumer Price Index for 
                                all Urban Consumer (CPI-U, as published 
                                by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 
                                the Department of Labor) for the 
                                calendar year preceding such calendar 
                                year, to

                                2 years prior to effective year.
            ``(2) Limitations on fixed compensation.--A victim may only 
        obtain fixed compensation once. Obtaining fixed compensation 
        shall not bar or limit the victim from receiving restitution 
        against any defendant for any offenses other than trafficking 
        in child pornography. A victim who receives fixed compensation 
        from the Child Pornography Victims' Fund may subsequently seek 
        restitution under this section in trafficking in child 
        pornography cases. However, when determining the amount of 
        restitution, the court shall deduct the amount the victim 
        received in fixed compensation from the full amount of the 
        victim's losses and shall exclude losses incurred prior to the 
        payment of fixed compensation.
            ``(3) Acceptance of restitution to make victim ineligible 
        for fixed compensation.--A victim who has collected payment of 
        restitution pursuant to this section in an amount greater than 
        the amount provided for under paragraph (1)(B) in a trafficking 
        in child pornography case shall be ineligible to receive fixed 
        compensation.
            ``(4) Attorney's fees.--
                    ``(A) In general.--An attorney may not charge, 
                receive, or collect, and the court may not approve, any 
                payment of fees and costs that in the aggregate exceeds 
                25 percent of any payment made under this section.
                    ``(B) Penalty.--Any attorney who violates paragraph 
                (1) shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for 
                not more than 1 year, or both.''.
    (d) Clerical Amendment.--Section 1593(b)(3) of title 18, United 
States Code, is amended by striking ``section 2259(b)(3)'' and 
inserting ``section 2259(c)(4)''.

        or entitle a defendant to reduce the amount of any other 
        penalty by the amount of the assessment. Any money received 
        from a defendant shall be disbursed so that each of the 
        following obligations is paid in full in the following 
        sequence:
                    ``(A) A special assessment under section 3013.

the payments ordered under section 2259(d), the Fund shall make such 
payments as it can satisfy in full with the available funds. In 
determining the order in which such payments shall be made, the Fund 
shall make payments based on the date they were ordered, with the 
earliest-ordered payments made first. Sums shall be eligible to be 
disbursed from the Fund beginning on the date that is 6 months after
