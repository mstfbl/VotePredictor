Secretary, in consultation with the Under Secretary for Management, 
shall establish Departmentwide policies to integrate all phases of the 
investment life cycle and help the Department identify, validate, and 
prioritize standards for common Component requirements for major 
acquisition program requirements in order to increase opportunities for 
effectiveness and efficiencies. The policies shall also include 
strategic alternatives for developing and facilitating a Department 
Component-driven requirements process that includes oversight of a 
development test and evaluation capability; identification of priority 
gaps and overlaps in Department capability needs; and provision of 
feasible technical alternatives, including innovative commercially 
available alternatives, to meet capability needs.
    ``(b) Mechanisms To Carry Out Requirement.--The Under Secretary for 
Management shall coordinate the actions necessary to carry out 
subsection (a), using such mechanisms as considered necessary by the 
Secretary to help the Department reduce unnecessary duplication and 
inefficiency for all Department investments, including major 
acquisition programs.
    ``(c) Coordination.--In coordinating the actions necessary to carry 
out subsection (a), the Deputy Secretary shall consult with the Under 
Secretary for Management, Component Acquisition Executives, and any 
other Department officials, including the Under Secretary for Science

Under Secretary for Management, are as follows:

        decision events of the investments or programs.
            ``(2) To ensure the requirements and scope of a major 
        investment or acquisition program are stable, measurable, 
        achievable, at an acceptable risk level, and match the 
        resources planned to be available.

        solicitation for a new contract, coordinate with other 
        Department entities as appropriate to prevent unnecessary

                common mission requirements and crosscutting 
                opportunities among Components to harmonize investments 
                and requirements and prevent overlap and unnecessary

                practices for strategic sourcing.
            ``(4) To ensure program managers of major investments and 
        acquisition programs conduct analyses, giving particular 
        attention to factors such as cost, schedule, risk, performance,
