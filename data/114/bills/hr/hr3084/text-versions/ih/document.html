                                 A BILL


 
  To improve the integrity and safety of Thoroughbred horseracing by 
requiring a uniform anti-doping program to be developed and enforced by 
     an independent Thoroughbred Horseracing Anti-Doping Authority.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Thoroughbred Horseracing Integrity 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress enacted the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 
        (15 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) to regulate interstate commerce with 
        respect to pari-mutuel wagering on Thoroughbred horseracing in 
        order to protect and further the Thoroughbred horseracing 
        industry of the United States. This Act does not modify or 
        eliminate any of the consents, approvals, or agreements 
        required by the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 or impair or 
        restrict the operation and enforcement of State law or 
        regulation of Thoroughbred horseracing with respect to matters 
        unrelated to anti-doping or for violations of State or Federal 
        criminal law.
            (2) The horseracing industry contributes approximately 
        $25,000,000,000 to the United States economy annually and 
        generates nearly 380,000 domestic jobs. Approximately 50 
        percent of the 317,000 starts by Thoroughbred horses in 2014 
        were made by horses that competed in more than one State.
            (3) Uniform adoption of national anti-doping standards for 
        Thoroughbred horseracing in the United States will promote 
        interstate commerce, encourage fair competition and a level 
        playing field, assure full and fair disclosure of information 
        to purchasers of breeding stock and to the wagering public, 
        will improve the marketplace for domestic and international 
        sales of the American Thoroughbred, will provide a platform for 
        consistency with all major international Thoroughbred 
        horseracing standards, address growing domestic concerns over 
        disparities with international rules, and provide for the 
        safety and welfare of horses and jockeys.
            (4) The use of therapeutic medications in Thoroughbred 
        horseracing in the United States must place the health and 
        welfare of the horse at the highest level of priority while 
        achieving consistency with the uses permitted in major 
        international Thoroughbred horseracing jurisdictions, including 
        the use of race-day medication. Because the various States have 
        been unable to adopt a national uniform anti-doping program, 
        national uniform regulations with respect to the use of, and 
        testing for, drugs capable of affecting the results of a 
        Thoroughbred horse race and therapeutic medications used in 
        Thoroughbred horseracing, such rules, procedures and 
        enforcement policies should be implemented, consistent with 
        internationally accepted best practices, by an independent 
        anti-doping organization authorized by an Act of Congress.
            (5) For human sports, Congress has demonstrated its 
        commitment to fair competition through legislation, oversight, 
        funding, and by its execution of an international treaty, the 
        UNESCO International Convention Against Doping in Sport. By 
        ratifying the UNESCO Convention, the United States agreed to 
        adopt appropriate measures consistent with the principles of 
        the World Anti-Doping Code and to take appropriate action, 
        including legislation, regulation, policies or administrative 
        practices to implement that commitment.
            (6) In the context of Olympic sports, Congress has 
        recognized the United States Anti-Doping Agency as an 
        independent anti-doping organization possessing high-level 
        expertise and credibility in the development and administration 
        of an anti-doping program.
            (7) Congress supports the establishment of an independent 
        anti-doping organization to ensure the wagering public's 
        confidence in the fairness of Thoroughbred horseracing and to 
        strengthen and harmonize anti-doping rules and sanctions for 
        Thoroughbred horseracing in order to ensure fair and 
        transparent Thoroughbred horseraces and to deter the commission 
        of anti-doping rule violations.

the public, shall establish uniform rules imposing sanctions against 
covered persons and/or covered horses for anti-doping rule violations. 
The sanctioning rules shall take into account the unique aspects of 
Thoroughbred horseracing, and shall be designed to ensure fair and 
transparent Thoroughbred horseraces and deter the commission of anti-
doping rule violations. The rules shall impose sanctions up to and 
including a lifetime ban from horseracing and shall include 
opportunities for anti-doping rule violators to reduce the otherwise 
applicable sanctions generally comparable to those opportunities 
afforded by the United States Anti-Doping Agency's Protocol for Olympic 
Movement Testing.

            (3) Thoroughbred horseracing matters unrelated to anti-
        doping as addressed in this Act; or
            (4) the use of medication in human participants in covered 
        races.

SEC. 9. STATE DELEGATION; DUTY OF COOPERATION.

            (1) The Authority may enter into agreements with one or 
        more State racing commissions to implement within their 
        respective jurisdictions any of the components of the 
        Thoroughbred horseracing anti-doping program established by the 
        Authority if the Authority determines, in its sole discretion, 
        that a particular State racing commission will be able to 
        implement a component of the Thoroughbred horseracing anti-
        doping program in accordance with the standards and 
        requirements established by the Authority. Any such agreement 
        shall remain in effect as long as the Authority, in its sole 
        discretion, determines the applicable racing commission to be 
        implementing the components of the medication regulation 
        program covered by the agreement in compliance with the 
        standards and requirements established by the Authority.
            (2) Where conduct by any person subject to the Thoroughbred 
        horseracing anti-doping program may involve both an anti-doping 
        rule violation and violation of State or Federal law, this Act 
        imposes a duty to cooperate and share information between the 
        Authority and State and Federal law enforcement authorities.

SEC. 10. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.

    The Authority shall not have the power to impose criminal sanctions 
and shall not be considered nor construed to be an agent of, or an 
actor on behalf of, the United States Government or any State.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The Thoroughbred horseracing anti-doping program established by 
this Act shall take effect on January 1, 2017. The Authority and State 
regulatory authorities shall work cooperatively to develop transition 
rules with respect to doping conduct, sanctions, and investigations 
arising prior to the effective date of the Thoroughbred horseracing 
anti-doping program established in accordance with in this Act.

SEC. 12. FUNDING.

    Nothing in this Act requires the United States Government to 
provide funding for or to guarantee the debts of the Authority. The 
funds necessary for the establishment and administration of the 
Thoroughbred horseracing anti-doping program shall be paid entirely by 
the Thoroughbred horseracing industry in accordance with the following 
provisions:
            (1) Initial funding to establish the Authority and 
        underwrite its operations prior to the effective date shall be 
        provided by loans obtained by and donations made to the 
        Authority; the Authority is empowered to borrow money and to 
        accept private donations and contributions toward the funding 
        of its operations.
            (2) By November 1, 2016, and prior to November 1 of each 
        year thereafter, the Authority shall determine and provide to 
        each State racing commission the estimated amount required per 
        racing starter to fund the Thoroughbred horseracing anti-doping 
        program for the coming year and to liquidate any loans or 
        funding shortfall in the current year and any prior years. Such 
        amount shall be based upon the annual budget of the Authority 
        for the succeeding year, as approved by the Authority's board 
        of directors. The Authority's initial budget shall require the 
        approval of two-thirds of its board of directors and any 
        subsequent budget that exceeds the preceding year's budget by 
        more than 5 percent shall also require the approval of two-
        thirds of the Authority's board of directors.
            (3) On or before the 20th day of each calendar month, each 
        State racing commission shall remit to the Authority an amount 
        equal to the applicable fee per racing start multiplied by the 
        number of racing starts in the State in the previous month.
            (4) Each State racing commission shall determine, subject 
        to the applicable laws and regulations of the State, the method 
        by which the requisite amount shall be allocated, assessed, and 
        collected, provided that in no event shall the funds be 
        obtained by means of an increase in the takeout.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
