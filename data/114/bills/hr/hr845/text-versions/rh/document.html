                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to publish in the Federal 
 Register a strategy to significantly increase the role of volunteers 
and partners in National Forest System trail maintenance, and for other 
                               purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National Forest 
System Trails Stewardship Act''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Definitions.
Sec. 4. National forest system trails volunteer and partnership 
                            strategy.
Sec. 5. Priority trail maintenance program.
Sec. 6. Cooperative agreements.
Sec. 7. Stewardship credits for outfitters and guides.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The National Forest System features a world-class trail 
        system with over 157,000 miles of trails that provide world-
        class opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, hunting, 
        mountain bicycling, motorized vehicles, and other outdoor 
        activities.
            (2) According to the Government Accountability Office, the 
        Forest Service is only able to maintain about one-quarter of 
        National Forest System trails to the agency standard, and the 
        agency faces a trail maintenance backlog of $314,000,000, and 
        an additional backlog of $210,000,000 in annual maintenance, 
        capital improvements, and operations.
            (3) The lack of maintenance on National Forest System 
        trails threatens access to public lands, and may cause 
        increased environmental damage, threaten public safety, and 
        increase future maintenance costs.
            (4) Federal budget limitations require solutions to 
        National Forest System trail maintenance issues that make more 
        efficient use of existing resources.
            (5) Volunteers, partners, and outfitters and guides play an 
        important role in maintaining National Forest System trails, 
        and a comprehensive strategy is needed to ensure that 
        volunteers and partners are used as effectively as possible.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
Register a strategy to significantly increase the role of volunteers 
and partners in trail maintenance.
    (b) Required Elements.--The strategy required by subsection (a) 
shall--
            (1) augment and support the capabilities of Federal 
        employees to carry out or contribute to trail maintenance;
            (2) provide meaningful opportunities for volunteers and 
        partners to carry out trail maintenance in each region of the 
        Forest Service;
            (3) address the barriers to increased volunteerism and 
        partnerships in trail maintenance identified by volunteers, 
        partners, and others;
            (4) prioritize increased volunteerism and partnerships in 
        trail maintenance in those regions with the most severe trail 
        maintenance needs, and where trail maintenance backlogs are 
        jeopardizing access to National Forest lands; and
            (5) aim to increase trail maintenance by volunteers and 
        partners by 100 percent by the date that is 5 years after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Additional Requirement.--As a component of the strategy, the 
Secretary shall study opportunities to improve trail maintenance by 
addressing opportunities to use fire crews in trail maintenance 
activities in a manner that does not jeopardize firefighting 
capabilities, public safety, or resource protection. Upon a 
determination that trail maintenance would be advanced by use of fire 
crews in trail maintenance, the Secretary shall incorporate these 
proposals into the strategy, subject to such terms and conditions as 
the Secretary determines to be necessary.
    (d) Volunteer Liability.--
            (1) In general.--Section 3 of the Volunteers in the 
        National Forests Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 558c) is amended by 
        adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) For the purposes of subsections (b), (c), and (d), the term 
`volunteer' includes a person providing volunteer services to the 
Secretary who--

        under a mutual benefit agreement with the Secretary; and
            ``(2) performs such volunteer services under the 
        supervision of the cooperator as directed by the Secretary in 
        the mutual benefit agreement, including direction that 
        specifies--

                volunteers and the supervision to be provided by the 
                cooperator;
                    ``(B) the applicable project safety standards and 
                protocols to be adhered to by the volunteers and 
                enforced by the cooperator; and
                    ``(C) the on-site visits to be made by the 
                Secretary, when feasible, to verify that volunteers are 
                performing the volunteer services and the cooperator is 
                providing the supervision agreed upon.''.
            (2) Additional requirement.--Not later than 2 years after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
        adopt regulations implementing this section. These regulations

        associated with volunteers undertaking trail maintenance is 
        shared by all administrative units.
    (e) Consultation.--The Secretary shall develop the strategy in 
consultation with volunteer and partner trail maintenance 
organizations, a broad array of outdoor recreation stakeholders, and 
other relevant stakeholders.

coordination implementation plan for the strategy which clearly defines 
roles and responsibilities for the administrative unit and district

assistance, and support for volunteers and partners to improve trail 
maintenance.

                    (C) the miles of National Forest System trails 
                maintained by volunteers and partners, and the
