SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings Relating to the Depreciation System of Federal 
Business Taxation.--Congress finds the depreciation system--
            (1) is rife with outdated asset classifications, inaccurate 
        depreciation schedules, targeted credits and deductions, and 
        targeted expensing provisions;
            (2) rewards some business activities over others;
            (3) reduces savings and investment in the United States by 
        increasing the rate of return that is required for investments 
        to be viable; and
            (4) creates complexity for both the Internal Revenue 
        Service and businesses.
    (b) Findings Relating to the Deduction of Business Interest.--
Congress finds that the business interest deduction--
            (1) encourages businesses to finance their operations with 
        debt;
            (2) results in negative effective tax rates for some 
        investments; and
            (3) heightens bankruptcy risk during periods of economic 
        distress.
    (c) Findings Relating to the Expensing of Investment.--Congress 
finds that allowing businesses to expense their investments--
            (1) will make more investment opportunities profitable for 
        businesses to undertake;
            (2) will promote investment in the United States;
            (3) will limit the Government's ability to reward specific 
        business activities through the tax code; and
            (4) will simplify business taxation.

SEC. 3. MAXIMUM TAX RATE FOR NET BUSINESS INCOME.

    (a) Individual Net Business Income.--
            (1) Maximum rate of 25 percent.--Paragraph (1) of section

                            (ii) by striking ``the adjusted net capital 
                        gain'' in clause (ii)(II) and inserting ``the 
                        sum of the adjusted net capital gain and the 
                        net business income''; and
                    (B) in subparagraph (E)(i) by striking 
                ``unrecaptured section 1250 gain'' and inserting ``25-
                percent rate gain''.
            (2) 25-percent rate gain.--Subsection (h) of section 1 is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(12) 25-percent rate gain.--For purposes of this 
        subsection--
                    ``(A) unrecaptured section 1250 gain, plus

``SEC. 1422. CONTRIBUTIONS TO A BUSINESS ENTITY.

    ``(a) By Business Entity.--
            ``(1) Cash.--If a business entity contributes cash to a 
        business entity of which it is or becomes a partial or full 
        owner, the amount contributed is not a deductible amount to the 
        contributor or a taxable receipt to the recipient.
            ``(2) Property or services.--If a business entity 
        contributes property or services to a business entity of which 
        it is or becomes a partial or full owner, the transaction will 
        not result in taxable receipts to the contributor or a 
        deduction for a business purchase for the recipient and will 
        not constitute a sale resulting in taxable receipts to the 
        contributor.
    ``(b) By Individual.--
            ``(1) Cash.--If an individual contributes cash to a 
        business entity, the amount contributed is not a deductible 
        amount to the contributor and the cash received by the business 
        entity is not a taxable receipt.
            ``(2) New property.--If an individual contributes to a 
        business entity property that the individual purchased for the 
        business entity but which was not used by any person after its 
        purchase, the property shall be considered purchased by such 
        business entity from the person from which the individual 
        purchased the property and the transaction will not result in a 
        deductible amount to the contributor.
            ``(3) Personal use property.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If an individual contributes 
                personal use property to a business entity in which the 
                individual has an ownership interest or for which the 
                individual receives an ownership interest, the business 
                entity shall not be permitted to deduct the value of 
                the property received as a business expense. The 
                business entity will have a tax basis in the 
                contributed property equal to the contributor's basis.
                    ``(B) Personal use property.--The term `personal 
                use property' means any property used by an individual 
                at any time other than in a business activity.

        business entity in which the individual has an ownership 
        interest or receives an ownership interest, the business entity 
        shall not be permitted to deduct the value of the services 
        received (or the value of the equity interest provided to the 
        services provider).

``SEC. 1422A. DISTRIBUTIONS OF PROPERTY.

    ``(a) Distributions Other Than to Controlling Business.--If a 
business entity distributes all or a portion of its assets to its 
owners (other than a controlling business entity), the business entity 
will be treated as if it sold the assets to its owners at fair market 
value. The fair market value will be determined by the distributing 
business entity and those determinations, unless unreasonable, will be 
binding on the recipients.
    ``(b) Distributions to a Controlling Business.--If a business 
entity distributes all or a portion of its assets to a controlling 
business entity, the controlling business entity will assume the 
distributing entity's tax attributes with respect to the assets and 
neither entity will have taxable receipts or a deduction as a result of 
the transaction.
    ``(c) Distribution of Personal Use Property.--If personal use 
property is distributed to the individual who contributed the personal 
use property to a business entity, the fair market value of the 
property for purposes of subsection (a) shall equal the basis of the 
property plus any enhancement in value of the property attributable to 
business purchases with respect to the property.
    ``(d) Controlling Business Entity.--A business entity is a 
`controlling business entity' with respect to another business entity 
if it, or any person to which it is related, owns directly or 
indirectly more than 50 percent of the profits or capital interest in 
the other business entity. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a 
person is related to a business entity if such person owns directly or 
indirectly more than 50 percent of the profits or capital interest in 
the business entity.
    ``(e) Application of This Section.--This section applies to both 
liquidating and nonliquidating distributions.

``SEC. 1422B. ASSET ACQUISITIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--If a business entity transfers some or all of 
its assets, the consideration received for such assets shall be 
allocated among the assets transferred in the same manner as was 
required by section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the 
transferee and transferor agree in writing on the allocation of any 
consideration, or as to the fair market value of any of the assets, 
such agreement shall be binding on both the transferor and transferee 
unless the Secretary determines that such allocation (or fair market 
value) is not appropriate.
    ``(b) Tax Consequences.--The tax consequences of an asset 
acquisition shall be determined in accordance with the rules of this 
chapter and shall be dependent upon allocations made under subsection 
(a). In general, consideration allocable to savings assets, such as 
stock in another business entity, would not be included in taxable 
receipts of the transferor and would not be a business purchase of the 
purchaser, but consideration allocable to the sale of tangible property 
and intangible property (other than savings assets) will constitute 
taxable receipts of the seller and a business purchase of the 
purchaser.
    ``(c) Election To Treat Asset Acquisition as a Stock Acquisition.--
In the case of the sale of substantially all of the assets of a 
business entity or substantially all of the assets of a line of 
business or a separately standing business of a business entity, the 
transferee and transferor can jointly elect to treat the acquisition as 
if it were an acquisition of the stock of a business entity holding the 
assets so transferred. In such case, the rules of section 1422C shall 
apply.
    ``(d) Authority To Require Allocation Agreement and Notice to the 
Secretary.--If the Secretary determines that certain types of asset 
acquisitions have significant possibilities of tax avoidance, the 
Secretary may require--
            ``(1) parties to such types of acquisitions to enter into 
        agreements allocating consideration,
            ``(2) parties to acquisitions involving certain kinds of 
        assets to enter into agreements allocating part of the 
        consideration to those assets, or
            ``(3) parties to certain acquisitions to report information 
        to the Secretary.
    ``(e) Asset Acquisition Rules Do Not Apply if Consideration 
Includes Equity in Purchaser.--
            ``(1) In general.--If a business entity issues its own 
        equity or equity in a subsidiary or other controlled entity as 
        part of the consideration for the transfer of assets to it, the 
        transaction shall be treated as a business purchase and not as 
        an asset acquisition, and the taxpayer shall not be entitled to 
        a loss carryover for any unused deduction attributable to the 
        equity portion of such transfer.
            ``(2) Equity.--For purposes of this subsection, equity 
        means--
                    ``(A) stock, in the case of a corporation,
                    ``(B) partnership or similar interest, in the case 
                of a partnership or limited liability company, and
                    ``(C) an ownership interest or interest in profits 
                in the case of any other business entity.

``SEC. 1422C. MERGERS, STOCK ACQUISITIONS, AND SPIN-OFFS, SPLIT-OFFS, 
              ETC.

    ``(a) Mergers.--A merger of one business entity into another or two 
businesses entities into a third business entity or any other similar 
transaction shall have no direct consequences under the business cash 
flow tax. The surviving entity shall assume the tax attributes of the 
merged business entities, including any loss carryovers and credit 
carryovers.
    ``(b) Stock Acquisition.--The acquisition of all or substantially 
all of the ownership interest in one business entity either for cash or 
in exchange for ownership in the acquiring entity or an entity 
controlled by the acquired entity shall have no direct consequences 
under the business cash flow tax.
    ``(c) Spin-Offs, Split-Offs, Etc.--A spin-off, split-off or split-
up of a business entity shall have no direct tax consequences under 
this chapter.
