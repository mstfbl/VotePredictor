SEC. 2. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT REVIEW OF CERTAIN FOREIGN FIGHTERS.

    (a) Review.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, shall initiate a review of known instances since 2011 in 
which a person has traveled or attempted to travel to a conflict zone 
in Iraq or Syria from the United States to join or provide material 
support or resources to a terrorist organization. Such review shall--
            (1) include relevant unclassified and classified 
        information held by the United States Government related to 
        each instance;
            (2) ascertain which factors, including operational issues, 
        security vulnerabilities, systemic challenges, or other issues 
        that may have undermined efforts to prevent the travel of such 
        persons to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the United 
        States, including the timely identification of suspects, 
        information sharing, intervention, and interdiction; and
            (3) identify lessons learned and areas for improvement to 
        prevent additional travel by such persons to a conflict zone in 
        Iraq or Syria, or other terrorist safe havens abroad, to join 
        or provide material support or resources to a terrorist 
        organization.
    (b) Information Sharing.--If necessary, the President shall direct 
the heads of relevant Federal agencies to provide the appropriate 
information necessary for the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
complete the review required under subsection (a).
    (c) Submission to Congress.--Not later than 120 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, 
consistent with the protection of classified information, submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees the results of the review required 
under subsection (a), which may include information on travel routes of 
greatest concern.
