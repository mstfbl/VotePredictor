 To promote trade and commercial enhancement between the United States 
                  and Israel, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel Trade and 
Commercial Enhancement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Israel is America's dependable, democratic ally in the 
        Middle East--an area of paramount strategic importance to the 
        United States.
            (2) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement formed 
        the modern foundation of the bilateral commercial relationship 
        between the two countries and was the first such agreement 
        signed by the United States with a foreign country.
            (3) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement has been 
        instrumental in expanding commerce and the strategic 
        relationship between the United States and Israel.
            (4) More than $45 billion in goods and services is traded 
        annually between the two countries in addition to roughly $10 
        billion in United States foreign direct investment in Israel.
            (5) The United States continues to look for and find new 
        opportunities to enhance cooperation with Israel, including 
        through the enactment of the United States-Israel Enhanced 
        Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) and the 
        United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public 
        Law 113-296).
            (6) It has been the policy of the United States Government 
        to combat all elements of the Arab League Boycott of Israel 
        by--
                    (A) public statements of Administration officials;
                    (B) enactment of relevant sections of the Export 
                Administration Act of 1979 (as continued in effect 
                pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
                Act), including sections to ensure foreign persons 
                comply with applicable reporting requirements relating 
                to the boycott;
                    (C) enactment of the 1976 Tax Reform Act (Public 
                Law 94-455) that denies certain tax benefits to 
                entities abiding by the boycott;
                    (D) ensuring through free trade agreements with 
                Bahrain and Oman that such countries no longer 
                participate in the boycott; and
                    (E) ensuring as a condition of membership in the 
                World Trade Organization that Saudi Arabia no longer 
                enforces the secondary or tertiary elements of the 
                boycott.

SEC. 3. STATEMENTS OF POLICY.

    Congress--
            (1) supports the strengthening of United States-Israel 
        economic cooperation and recognizes the tremendous strategic, 
        economic, and technological value of cooperation with Israel;
            (2) recognizes the benefit of cooperation with Israel to 
        United States companies, including by improving American 
        competitiveness in global markets;
            (3) recognizes the importance of trade and commercial 
        relations to the pursuit and sustainability of peace, and 
        supports efforts to bring together the United States, Israel, 
        the Palestinian territories, and others in enhanced commerce;
            (4) opposes politically motivated actions that penalize or 
        otherwise limit commercial relations specifically with Israel 
        such as boycotts, divestment or sanctions;
            (5) notes that the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of 
        Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-governmental 
        bodies, international organizations, and other such entities is 
        contrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
        principle of non-discrimination;
            (6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated 
        actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations 
        specifically with Israel such as boycotts, divestment from, or 
        sanctions against Israel as a topic of discussion at the U.S.-
        Israel Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) and other areas 
        to support the strengthening of the United States-Israel 
        commercial relationship and combat any commercial 
        discrimination against Israel;
            (7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or 
        prosecutions by governments or international organizations of 
        United States persons on the sole basis of such persons doing 
        business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-
        controlled territories; and
            (8) supports American States examining a company's 
        promotion or compliance with unsanctioned boycotts, divestment 
        from, or sanctions against Israel as part of its consideration 
        in awarding grants and contracts and supports the divestment of 
        State assets from companies that support or promote actions to 
        boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel.

SEC. 4. PRINCIPAL TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Commercial Partnerships.--Among the principal trade negotiating 
objectives of the United States for proposed trade agreements with

        commercial activity solely between the United States and 
        Israel.
            (2) To discourage politically motivated actions to boycott, 
        divest from, or sanction Israel and to seek the elimination of 
        politically motivated non-tariff barriers on Israeli goods, 
        services, or other commerce imposed on the State of Israel.
            (3) To seek the elimination of state-sponsored unsanctioned 
        foreign boycotts against Israel or compliance with the Arab 
        League Boycott of Israel by prospective trading partners.
    (b) Effective Date.--This section takes effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act and applies with respect to negotiations 
commenced before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act.

        United States persons operating or doing business in Israel, 
        with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-controlled territories.
            (2) A description of specific steps being taken by the 
        United States to encourage foreign countries and international 
        organizations to cease creating such barriers and to dismantle 
        measures already in place and an assessment of the 
        effectiveness of such steps.
            (3) A description of specific steps being taken by the 
        United States to prevent investigations or prosecutions by 
        governments or international organizations of United States 
        persons on the sole basis of such persons doing business with 
        Israel, with Israeli entities, or in Israeli-controlled 
        territories.
            (4) Decisions by foreign persons, including corporate

                divesting themselves of an ownership interest in the 
                issuer, or placing sanctions on the issuer because of 
                the issuer's relationship with Israel, entities owned 
                or controlled by the government of Israel, or entities 
                operating in Israel or Israeli-controlled territory.
