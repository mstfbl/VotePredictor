                the district in which the individual attempted to 
                acquire a firearm for a declaratory judgment on the 
                eligibility of the individual to receive and possess a 
                firearm.
                    ``(B) Expedited hearing.--The court shall hold a

                    ``(D) Remedies.--If the government does not so 
                prove the ineligibility, the court shall order the

                records of the national instant criminal background 
                check system with respect to the individual within 5 
                business days, and shall award the individual the costs 
                of bringing the action and a reasonable attorney's

SEC. 3. ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE CONGRESS ON DISPOSITION OF CHALLENGES TO 
              ACCURACY OF RECORDS OF THE NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL 
              BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM.

    The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall submit 
annually to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a 
written report that specifies--
            (1) the total number of challenges to the accuracy of the 
        records of the National Instant Criminal Background Check 
        System (in this section referred to as the ``NICS system'') 
        established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence 
        Prevention Act that were received by the NICS system during the 
        year covered by the report;
            (2) the total number of the challenges that were processed 
        to final disposition by the NICS system;
            (3) the total number of the challenges with respect to 
        which the initial determination of the NICS system was 
        reversed, and with respect to those challenges, the total 
        number in which each reason for the initial determination was 
        made;
            (4) the total number of the challenges with respect to 
        which the initial determination of the NICS system was not 
        reversed, and with respect to those challenges, the total 
        number in which each reason for not doing so was made; and
            (5) the average length of time needed to complete the 
        processing of the challenges referred to in paragraph (2).

SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the right of the people to keep and bear arms is a 
        fundamental component of self-government and the preservation 
        of individual liberty;
            (2) deprivation of the constitutional right to bear arms 
        requires due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments 
        to the Constitution of the United States; and
            (3) ignoring appeals of determinations made by the National 
        Instant Criminal Background Check System violates due process.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
