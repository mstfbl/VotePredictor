U.S.C. 611(d)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(d) Data Exchange Standards for Improved Interoperability.--
            ``(1) Designation.--The Secretary shall, in consultation 
        with an interagency work group established by the Office of 
        Management and Budget and considering State government 
        perspectives, by rule, designate data exchange standards to 
        govern, under this part--
                    ``(A) necessary categories of information that 
                State agencies operating programs under State plans 
                approved under this part are required under applicable 
                Federal law to electronically exchange with another 
                State agency; and
                    ``(B) Federal reporting and data exchange required 
                under applicable Federal law.
            ``(2) Requirements.--The data exchange standards required 
        by paragraph (1) shall, to the extent practicable--
                    ``(A) incorporate a widely accepted, non-
                proprietary, searchable, computer-readable format, such 
                as the eXtensible Markup Language;

                maintained by intergovernmental partnerships, such as 
                the National Information Exchange Model;

                accounting principles;
                    ``(E) be implemented in a manner that is cost-
                effective and improves program efficiency and 
                effectiveness; and

                necessary.

        shall be construed to require a change to existing data 
        exchange standards found to be effective and efficient.''.

after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services shall issue a proposed rule that--
            (1) identifies federally required data exchanges, include 
        specification and timing of exchanges to be standardized, and 
        address the factors used in determining whether and when to 
        standardize data exchanges; and
            (2) specifies State implementation options and describes 
        future milestones.
