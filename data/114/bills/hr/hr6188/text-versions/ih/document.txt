                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a grant program for 
                    early childhood STEM activities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Early STEM Achievement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Numerous studies have highlighted the long-term 
        academic benefits of high-quality early childhood education and 
        care. The Learning Policy Institute, for example, reported in 
        2015 that North Carolina students who participated in early 
        childhood programs received higher scores on third-grade 
        standardized math assessments than their peers who did not 
        participate. Similarly, Michigan children who attended early 
        learning programs had better kindergarten readiness and better 
        reading and math proficiency relative to their peers who did 
        not have access to such programs.
            (2) Studies have also shown lower high school dropout rates 
        among children who participate in early childhood education 
        programs relative to their peers who did not, showing that the 
        positive results of quality early education programs continue 
        for many years.
            (3) Beyond academic benefits, researchers have shown 
        positive economic impacts of early childhood programs. In 2015, 
        a National Bureau of Economic Research study reported that each 
        dollar invested in early childhood returns approximately seven 
        dollars, in terms of workforce development. The Federal Reserve 
        has also called for increased access to early childhood 
        education, pointing to the potential for future economic 
        development.
            (4) There has been a growing need for STEM workers that is 
        projected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated 
        in 2012 that STEM occupations will grow at a faster rate than 
        other professions, noting also that the median annual salary 
        for STEM workers is higher than for other professions.
            (5) Beginning STEM education as early as possible is key to 
        future success in these fields, both in school and potentially 
        in the workforce. To that end, businesses in the STEM fields 
        like National Grid have sought through corporate citizenship 
        programs to connect with and inspire young learners.
            (6) Studies have shown that simple, age-appropriate 
        activities, like building a tower of blocks or spinning a 
        mobile in a crib, can help encourage STEM learning. As a White 
        House blog post on the importance of early STEM noted, 
        ``Research indicates that as early as infancy, young children 
        start developing and testing hypotheses for how the world 
        around them works.''.
            (7) A 2014 study from the University of California-Berkeley 
        Center for the Study of Child Care Employment found that many 
        early childhood practitioners feel poorly equipped to teach 
        early STEM skills, making professional development and training 
        opportunities critical.

SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.
