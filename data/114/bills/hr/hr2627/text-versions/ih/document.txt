                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to expand the 
                     use of salad bars in schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Salad Bars in Schools Expansion 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States, one-third of all school-aged 
        children are overweight or obese and very few eat the daily 
        amount of fruits and vegetables recommended by national health 
        authorities.
            (2) On average, more than 30 million children participate 
        in the National School Lunch Program daily, with more than 70 
        percent qualifying for free or reduced-price meals based on 
        family household income.
            (3) Improving the healthfulness of school meals, including 
        serving more fruits and vegetables, will improve children's 
        eating habits and their health. The Dietary Guidelines for 
        Americans recommends that children ``make half their plate 
        fruits and vegetables'' at each meal.
            (4) Research indicates that school salad bars are an 
        effective strategy to increase children's consumption of a wide 
        variety of fruits and vegetables.
            (5) Salad bars are one of the easiest ways for school food 
        authorities to meet the new school lunch nutrition standards 
        that require serving a fruit and a vegetable every day, a 
        colorful variety of vegetables every week, and that students 
        select at least one-half cup of a fruit or a vegetable at 
        lunch.
            (6) Salad bars are effective in elementary, middle, and 
        high school, they empower students to try new fruits and 
        vegetables and are a tangible example of a school's commitment 
        to wellness and healthier school meals.

SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF SALAD BARS.

    Section 18 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 
U.S.C. 1769) is amended by adding at the end the following:
