To amend title 18, United States Code, to give nationwide effect to the 
 least restrictive State laws regarding the carrying of firearms that 
    are concealed, or are partially or fully visible to the public.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Firearm Rights Equally Enforced 
Act'' or the ``FREE Act''.

SEC. 2. NATIONWIDE EFFECT GIVEN TO LEAST RESTRICTIVE STATE LAWS 
              REGARDING THE CARRYING OF FIREARMS THAT ARE CONCEALED, OR 
              ARE PARTIALLY OR FULLY VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 926C the following:
``Sec. 926D. Nationwide effect given to least restrictive State laws 
              regarding the carrying of firearms that are concealed, or 
              are partially or fully visible to the public
    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the law of any 
State or any political subdivision of a State, an individual who is not 
prohibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm and to whom a State 
has issued a license or permit to carry a concealed firearm, or to 
carry a firearm that is partially or fully visible to the public, may 
do so in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce in any other 
State, subject to subsection (b).
    ``(b) Limitations.--
            ``(1) General rule.--A person may exercise the right 
        granted by subsection (a) subject to any limitation imposed by 
        the State that issued the license or permit, except as provided 
        in paragraph (2) or (3).
            ``(2) Authority to impose lesser restrictive limitations.--
        A State may impose a lesser restrictive limitation on the 
        exercise of the right granted by subsection (a) than any 
        imposed by the State referred to in paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Special rule relating to fees.--In addition to the 
        authority provided by paragraph (2), a State may condition the 
        exercise of the right granted by subsection (a) on the payment 
        of a fee, the level of which may be greater than the level of 
        the fee (if any) imposed by the State referred to in paragraph 
        (1) as a condition of issuing the license or permit, but any 
        such fee may not be set at a level that unduly burdens the 
        exercise of the right.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for such chapter is 
amended by inserting after the item relating to section 926C the 
following:

``926D. Nationwide effect given to least restrictive State laws 
                            regarding the carrying of firearms that are 
                            concealed, or are partially or fully 
                            visible to the public.''.
