SEC. 2. PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO CELLULAR NETWORK RESILIENCY.

    (a) Roaming Agreements.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall commence a proceeding on

which shall allow for mobile service at reasonable rates during times 
of emergency during which there is a mobile service outage lasting 
longer than 24 hours.
    (b) Emergency Communications.--Not later than 90 days after the

emergency to or from 911 services.
    (c) Directory.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall create a master 
        point of contact directory to provide for effective 
        communication between public safety answering points and 
        telecommunications service providers.
            (2) Confidentiality.--The directory established under this 
        subsection shall be available to telecommunications service 
        providers and public safety answering points on a confidential 
        basis.
            (3) Exemption from paperwork reduction act requirements.--
        In establishing this directory, the Commission shall be 
        exempted from chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code 
        (commonly known as the Paperwork Reduction Act).
    (d) Study on Network Resiliency.--Not later than 18 months after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to 
Congress, and make publically available on the Commission's website, a

        public safety answering points in times of emergency on a 
        confidential basis; and
            (2)(A) making telecommunications service provider-owned 
        WiFi access points, and other communications technologies 
        operating on unlicensed spectrum, available to the general 
        public for access to 911 services, without requiring any login 
        credentials, during times of emergency when mobile service is 
        unavailable; and
            (B) whether non-telecommunications service provider-owned 
        WiFi access points can provide public access to 911 services 
        during times of emergency.
