            (1) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the 
        following new subparagraph:
                    ``(A) Initial inspection.--

                        before any assistance payment is made to 
                        determine whether the dwelling unit meets the 
                        housing quality standards under subparagraph

                        assistance payments may be made for the unit 
                        notwithstanding subparagraph (C) if failure to

            (1) Adjustments to operating formula.--If the Secretary of 
        Housing and Urban Development determines that the application

        material and disproportionate reduction in the rental income of 
        certain public housing agencies during the first year in which 
        such subsections are implemented, the Secretary may make 
        appropriate adjustments in the formula income for such year of 
        those agencies experiencing such a reduction.
            (2) HUD reports on revenue and cost impact.--In each of the 
        first two years after the first year in which subsections (a) 
        through (e) are implemented, the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development shall submit a report to Congress identifying and 
        calculating the impact of changes made by such subsections and 
        section 104 of this Act on the revenues and costs of operating 
        public housing units, the voucher program for rental assistance 
        under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, and 
        the program under such section 8 for project-based rental 
        assistance. If such report identifies a material reduction in 
        the net income of public housing agencies nationwide or a 
        material increase in the costs of funding the voucher program 
        or the project-based assistance program, the Secretary shall 
        include in such report recommendations for legislative changes 
        to reduce or eliminate such a reduction.
    (h) Effective Date.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall issue notice or regulations to implement this section and this 
section shall take effect after such issuance, except that this section 
may only take effect upon the commencement of a calendar year.

        Notwithstanding any other law, regulation, or guideline of the 
        Secretary, including chapter 2.4 of the Condominium Project 
        Approval and Processing Guide of the FHA, the Secretary shall 
        streamline the project certification requirements that are 
        applicable to the insurance under this section for mortgages 
        for condominium projects so that recertifications are 
        substantially less burdensome than certifications. The 
        Secretary shall consider lengthening the time between 
        certifications for approved properties, and allowing updating 
        of information rather than resubmission.
            ``(2) Commercial space requirements.--Notwithstanding any 
        other law, regulation, or guideline of the Secretary, including 
        chapter 2.1.3 of the Condominium Project Approval and 
        Processing Guide of the FHA, in providing for exceptions to the 
        requirement for the insurance of a mortgage on a condominium 
        property under this section regarding the percentage of the 
        floor space of a condominium property that may be used for 
        nonresidential or commercial purposes, the Secretary shall 
        provide that--
                    ``(A) any request for such an exception and the 
                determination of the disposition of such request may be 
                made, at the option of the requester, under the direct 
                endorsement lender review and approval process or under 
                the HUD review and approval process through the 
                applicable field office of the Department; and
                    ``(B) in determining whether to allow such an 
                exception for a condominium property, factors relating 
                to the economy for the locality in which such project 
                is located or specific to project, including the total 
                number of family units in the project, shall be 
                considered.

        regulation, or guideline of the Secretary, including chapter 
        1.8.8 of the Condominium Project Approval and Processing Guide 
        of the FHA and section 203.41 of the Secretary's regulations 
        (24 C.F.R. 203.41), existing standards of the Federal Housing 
        Finance Agency relating to encumbrances under private transfer 
        fee covenants shall apply to the insurance of mortgages by the 
        Secretary under this section to the same extent and in the same 
        manner that such standards apply to the purchasing, investing 
        in, and otherwise dealing in mortgages by the Federal National 
        Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
        Corporation.
            ``(4) Owner-occupancy requirement.--
                    ``(A) Reduction to 35 percent.--Except as provided 
                in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and 
                notwithstanding any other law, regulation, or guideline 
                of the Secretary, in order for a condominium project to 
                be acceptable to the Secretary for insurance under this 
                section, at least 35 percent of all family units 
                (including units not covered by FHA-insured mortgages) 
                must be occupied by the owners as a principal residence 
                or a secondary residence (as such terms are defined by 
                the Secretary), or must have been sold to owners who 
                intend to meet such occupancy requirement.
                    ``(B) Other considerations.--The Secretary may 
                increase the percentage applicable pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A) to a condominium project on a project-
                by-project basis, and in determining such percentage 
                for a project shall consider factors relating to the 
                economy for the locality in which such project is 
                located or specific to project, including the total 
                number of family units in the project.''.
