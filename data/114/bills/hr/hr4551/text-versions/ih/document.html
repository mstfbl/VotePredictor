        areas in which such individuals reside, the goods and services 
        purchased by such individuals, and the prices typically by such 
        individuals for those goods and services; and
            (3) is not based on any other consumer price index 
        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

        benefit payable under this title, effective for adjustments 
        under this subsection to the primary insurance amount on which 
        such benefit is based (or to any such benefit under section 227 
        or 228), the applicable Consumer Price Index shall be deemed to 
        be the Consumer Price Index for Older Americans and such 
        primary insurance amount shall be deemed adjusted under this 
        subsection using such Index''; and
            (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``and by section 9001''

        our Promise to Seniors Act,''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments in Applicable Former Law.--Section 
215(i)(1)(C) of such Act, as in effect in December 1978 and applied in 
certain cases under the provisions of such Act in effect after December

with respect to any monthly insurance benefit payable under this title, 
effective for adjustments under this subsection to the primary 
insurance amount on which such benefit is based (or to any such benefit

the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following:
    ``(6) Any provision of law (other than in this title) which 
provides for adjustment of an amount based on a change in benefit 
amounts resulting from a determination made under this subsection shall 
be applied and administered without regard to the amendments made by 
section 3 of the Keeping our Promise to Seniors Act.''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) shall 
apply to determinations made with respect to cost-of-living computation 
quarters beginning after the date that is 1 year after the date of the
