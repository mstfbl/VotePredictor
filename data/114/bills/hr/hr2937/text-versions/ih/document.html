Sec. 8. Report on use and ownership of confiscated property.
Sec. 9. Termination.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In his December 17, 2014, announcement to pursue the 
        normalization of relations with Cuba, President Barack Obama 
        stated, ``I believe that more resources should be able to reach 
        the Cuban people. So we're significantly increasing the amount 
        of money that can be sent to Cuba, and removing limits on 
        remittances that support humanitarian projects, the Cuban 
        people, and the emerging Cuban private sector.''.
            (2) In his January 14, 2011, comments on the easing of 
        travel sanctions, President Barack Obama also stated, ``These 
        measures will increase people-to-people contact; support civil 
        society in Cuba; enhance the free flow of information to, from, 
        and among the Cuban people; and help promote their independence 
        from Cuban authorities.''.
            (3) Article 18 of the 1976 Constitution of Cuba reads, 
        ``The State directs and controls foreign commerce.''.
            (4) The largest company in Cuba is the Grupo Gaesa (Grupo 
        de Administracion Empresarial S.A.), founded by General Raul 
        Castro Ruz in the 1990s, controlled and operated by the Cuban 
        military, which oversees all investments, and run by General 
        Raul Castro's son-in-law, General Luis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-
        Callejas.
            (5) On June 3, 2015, the United States House of 
        Representatives voted overwhelmingly in support of a provision 
        prohibiting exports to the Cuban military and security services 
        in the Fiscal Year 2016 Commerce, Justice, and Science 
        Appropriations bill (H.R. 2578), with a recorded vote of 153 to 
        273 in opposition to House Amendment 308 to strike that 
        provision.
            (6) The Cuban military, through its tourism conglomerates, 
        is currently operating resort facilities in properties 
        confiscated from United States citizens.
            (7) In 2003, a United States grand jury indicted General 
        Ruben Martinez Puente, head of the Cuban Air Force, and two 
        Cuban Air Force pilots, Col. Lorenzo Alberto Perez-Perez and 
        Francisco Perez-Perez, on four counts of murder, two counts of 
        destruction of aircraft, and one count of conspiracy to kill 
        United States nationals for their roles in the February 24, 
        1996, attack by Cuban military jets over international waters 
        on two United States civilian Cessna planes operated by the 
        Brothers To The Rescue humanitarian organization.
            (8) The 2003 United States indictment against Cuban 
        military officials is the only outstanding indictment against 
        senior military officials from a country designated by the 
        United States as a ``state sponsor of terrorism'' for the 
        murder of United States nationals.
            (9) In a December 17, 2014, article in Politico, United 
        States Representative James McGovern (D-MA) stated that General 
        Raul Castro admitted to giving the order to shoot down the 
        United States civilian planes that resulted in the murder of 
        those United States nationals in 1996. ``I gave the order. I'm 
        the one responsible.'', Castro told McGovern.
            (10) One of the Cuban spies exchanged in the December 17, 
        2014, deal by President Obama with the Cuban regime was Gerardo 
        Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence for murder 
        conspiracy in the deaths of three United States citizens, 
        Armando Alejandre, Jr., Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and 
        permanent resident of the United States, Pablo Morales.
            (11) According to a July 16, 2013, article in The New York 
        Times, the Cuban military played a central role in the 2013 
        trafficking incident that involved more than 240 metric tons of 
        heavy weapons, including fully fueled MiG fighter jets, 
        missiles, and air defense systems, to North Korea.
            (12) A United Nations panel of experts found that the 
        trafficking incident described in paragraph (11) violated 
        United Nations Security Council sanctions and was the largest 
        weapons cache ever intercepted being transported to or from 
        North Korea. The Cuban military refused to cooperate with 
        United Nations investigators.
            (13) According to a March 5, 2015, article in The 
        Washington Times, in February 2015, the Colombian authorities 
        intercepted a Chinese-flagged vessel carrying a clandestine 
        shipment of war materiel destined for the Cuban military, via 
        one of its shadow companies, TecnoImport S.A. The shipment, 
        disguised as grain products, included 99 rockets, 3,000 cannon 
        shells, 100 tons of military-grade dynamite and 2,600,000 
        detonators.
            (14) According to a March 25, 2014, article in The New York 
        Times and an April 15, 2014, Financial Times article, the Cuban 
        military has provided military intelligence, weapons training, 
        strategic planning, and security logistics to the military and 
        security forces of Venezuela, which has contributed to the 
        subversion of democratic institutions and violent suppression 
        of peaceful protests in Venezuela.
            (15) The Cuba 2013 Human Rights Report prepared by the 
        Department of State states that ``the military maintained 
        effective control over the security forces, which committed 
        human rights abuses against civil rights activists and other 
        citizens alike.''.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to support the efforts of the people of Cuba to promote 
        the establishment of basic freedoms in Cuba, including a 
        democratic political system in which the military and other 
        security forces are under the control of democratically elected 
        civilian leaders;
            (2) to ensure that legal travel and trade with Cuba by 
        citizens and residents of the United States does not serve to 
        enrich or empower the military or other security forces of Cuba 
        run by the Castro family;
            (3) to support the emergence of a government in Cuba that 
        does not oppress the people of Cuba and does not use its 
        military or other security forces to persecute, intimidate, 
        arrest, imprison, or assassinate dissidents;
            (4) to bring to justice in the United States the officials 
        of Cuba involved in the February 24, 1996, attack of two United 
        States civilian Cessna aircraft by Cuban military jets over 
        international waters; and
            (5) to counter the efforts of Cuba, through military and 
        other assistance, to promote repression elsewhere in the 
        Western Hemisphere, especially in Venezuela.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THE MINISTRY OF THE
