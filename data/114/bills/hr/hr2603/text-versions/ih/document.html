        circumstances, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(4).

        panel shall complete a review of the record of the liability 
        action and shall make a finding under this subsection.
            (2) Finding described.--A finding under this subsection 
        shall include the following:
                    (A) A determination of whether there are any 
                applicable clinical practice guidelines to the health 
                care liability action that substantively pertains to 
                the injury suffered by the claimant.
                    (B) Whether the applicable eligible professional 
                has alleged adherence to any such guideline.
                    (C) Whether the applicable eligible professional 
                adhered to any such guideline.
                    (D) Whether there is a reasonable probability 
                that--
                            (i) the applicable eligible professional 
                        violated the applicable clinical practice 
                        guideline;
                            (ii) that violation proximately caused the 
                        claimant's alleged injury; and
                            (iii) the claimant suffered damages as a 
                        result of the injury.
            (3) Use at trial.--The finding under this subsection may be 
        received into evidence by the court. If the independent medical 
        review panel made any finding under paragraph (2)(D) that there 
        was no reasonable probability of the matters described in 
        clauses (i) through (iii), the court may issue a summary 
        judgment in favor of the applicable eligible professional 
        unless the claimant is able to show otherwise by clear and 
        convincing evidence. If the panel made a finding under 
        subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (2) that there was 
        an applicable clinical practice guideline that the defendant 
        adhered to, the court shall issue summary judgment in favor of 
        the applicable eligible professional unless the claimant is 
        able to show otherwise by clear and convincing evidence. Any 
        preliminary finding that the defendant applicable eligible 
        professional did not breach the standard of care as set forth 
        under the prescribed medical practice guidelines or that the 
        defendant applicable eligible professional's nonadherence to 
        the applicable standard was neither the cause in fact nor the 
        proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury or that the plaintiff 
        did not incur any damages as a result shall be given deference 
        by the court and shall entitle the defendant applicable 
        eligible professional to summary judgment unless the plaintiff 
        is able to show by clear and convincing evidence that the 
        independent medical review panel was in error and that there is 
        a genuine issue as to a material fact in the case.
