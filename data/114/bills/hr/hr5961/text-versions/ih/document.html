                                 A BILL


 
To provide for relief of victims of genocide, crimes against humanity, 
 and war crimes in Iraq and Syria, for accountability for perpetrators 
                of these crimes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and 
Accountability Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 17, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry 
        stated, ``in my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide 
        against groups in areas under its control, including Yezidis, 
        Christians, and Shia Muslims. Daesh is genocidal by self-
        proclamation, by ideology, and by actions--in what it says, 
        what it believes, and what it does. Daesh is also responsible 
        for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing directed at 
        these same groups and in some cases also against Sunni Muslims, 
        Kurds, and other minorities . . . the full facts must be 
        brought to light by an independent investigation and through 
        formal legal determination made by a competent court or 
        tribunal . . . the United States will strongly support efforts 
        to collect, document, preserve, and analyze the evidence of 
        atrocities, and we will do all we can to see that the 
        perpetrators are held accountable . . . the best response to 
        genocide is a reaffirmation of the fundamental right to survive 
        of every group targeted for destruction. What Daesh wants to 
        erase, we must preserve.''.
            (2) Secretary of State Kerry stated in the ``Atrocities 
        Prevention Report'', transmitted to Congress on March 17, 2016, 
        ``We assess that violent extremists have committed mass 
        atrocities in the Middle East and that Yezidis, Christians, and 
        Shia Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority 
        groups are among the victims. It is important that the 
        international community collectively support the victims of all 
        Da'esh atrocities. We continue to work on responding to the 
        situation on the ground and we continue to investigate and 
        assess all relevant information as it becomes available . . . 
        The United States supports accountability efforts for those 
        responsible for atrocities, human rights violations and abuses 
        and violations of international humanitarian law. The United 
        States strongly supports a comprehensive approach towards 
        transitional justice, including accountability for atrocities, 
        compensation and rehabilitation for victims, and steps towards 
        national reconciliation . . . The Department of State has a 
        longstanding commitment to providing support for the urgent 
        humanitarian needs of conflict-affected populations in Iraq, 
        Syria, and across the world, including but not limited to 
        members of ethnic and religious minorities.''.
            (3) The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on 
        the Syrian Arab Republic stated in its February 3, 2016, 
        report, ``Detainees held by the Government were beaten to 
        death, or died as a result of injuries sustained due to 
        torture. Others perished as a consequence of inhuman living 
        conditions. The Government has committed the crimes against 
        humanity of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of 
        sexual violence, torture, imprisonment, enforced disappearance 
        and other inhuman acts. Based on the same conduct, war crimes 
        have also been committed . . . Jabhat Al-Nusra has set up 
        detention facilities in Idlib where deaths in detention were 
        documented. The terrorist group also conducted mass executions 
        of captured Government soldiers. Both Jabhat Al-Nusra and some 
        anti-Government armed groups have committed the war crimes of 
        murder, cruel treatment, and torture. ISIS subjected detainees 
        to serious abuses, including torture and summary executions. 
        Detainees were frequently executed after unauthorised courts 
        issued a death sentence. ISIS has committed the crimes against 
        humanity of murder and torture, and war crimes.''.
            (4) The International Criminal Investigative Training 
        Assistance Program and the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
        Development Assistance and Training of the Department of 
        Justice have provided technical assistance to governmental 
        judicial and law enforcement entities in Iraq, including with 
        funding support from the Department of State.
            (5) The Chaldean Catholic Archdiocese of Erbil (Iraq) is an 
        example of an entity that has not received funding from any 
        government and has been providing assistance to internally 
        displaced families of Yezidis, Muslims, and Christians, 
        including food, resettlement from tents to permanent housing, 
        and rent for Yezidis, medical care and education for Yezidis 
        and Muslims through clinics, schools, and a university that are 
        open to all, and some form of these types of assistance to all 
        of the estimated 10,500 internally displaced Christian families 
        in the greater Erbil region.
            (6) In fiscal year 2015, the United States Government 
        admitted to the United States through the U.S. Refugee 
        Admissions Program persons from Priority Two groups of special 
        humanitarian concern, as designated by Congress, including--
                    (A) Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian 
                Catholics, and Ukrainian Orthodox, from the former 
                Soviet Union;
                    (B) Iraqis at-risk because they were or are 
                employed in Iraq by the United States Government, a 
                media or nongovernmental organization headquartered in 
                the United States, or an organization or entity that 
                received funding from the United States Government, or 
                are related to someone who is or was so employed;
                    (C) religious minorities in Iran; or
                    (D) members of other groups as designated by the 
                United States Government, including former political 
                prisoners, active members of persecuted religious 
                minorities, human rights activists, and forced labor 
                conscripts in Cuba, minors in Honduras, El Salvador, 
                and Guatemala, ethnic minorities from Burma in 
                Malaysia, Bhutanese in Nepal, and Congolese in Rwanda.
            (7) Through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the United 
        States Government--
                    (A) admitted 12,676 Iraqi refugees in fiscal year 
                2015, including at least 2,113 Christians, 213 Yezidis,
