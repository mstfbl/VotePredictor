        coverage' means, with respect to any employee, coverage under 
        any group health plan made available to the employee by an 
        employer which is excludable from the employee's gross income 
        under section 106, or would be so excludable if it were 
        employer-provided coverage (within the meaning of such section 
        106).
            ``(2) Exceptions.--The term `applicable employer-sponsored 
        coverage' shall not include--
                    ``(A) any coverage (whether through insurance or 
                otherwise) described in section 9832(c)(1) (other than 
                subparagraph (G) thereof) or for long-term care, or
                    ``(B) any coverage under a separate policy, 
                certificate, or contract of insurance which provides 
                benefits substantially all of which are for treatment

                is not allowable.
            ``(3) Coverage includes employee paid portion.--Coverage 
        shall be treated as applicable employer-sponsored coverage 
        without regard to whether the employer or employee pays for the 
        coverage.
            ``(4) Self-employed individual.--In the case of an 
        individual who is an employee within the meaning of section 
        401(c)(1), coverage under any group health plan providing 
        health insurance coverage shall be treated as applicable 
        employer-sponsored coverage if a deduction is allowable under 
        section 162(l) with respect to all or any portion of the cost 
        of the coverage.
            ``(5) Governmental plans included.--Applicable employer-
        sponsored coverage shall include coverage under any group 
        health plan established and maintained primarily for its 
        civilian employees by the Government of the United States, by 
        the government of any State or political subdivision thereof, 
        or by any agency or instrumentality of any such government.
            ``(6) Employee.--The term `employee' includes any former

        individual.''.
