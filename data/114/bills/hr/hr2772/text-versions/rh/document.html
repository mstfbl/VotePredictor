appropriated under titles III through VI of this Act may be made 
available to provide assistance for a foreign country under a new 
bilateral agreement governing the terms and conditions under which such

                is providing substantial reimbursement of such taxes; 
                or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United

                that United States assistance is not subject to 
                taxation.
            (2) The Secretary of State shall consult with the

        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United 
        States and such government that describes, among other things,

        States assistance provided under that agreement;
            (2) the term ``taxes and taxation'' shall include value

extended for an additional fiscal year if the Secretary of State or the 
USAID Administrator, as appropriate, determines and reports promptly to 
the Committees on Appropriations that the termination of assistance to 
a country or a significant change in circumstances makes it unlikely 
that such designated funds can be obligated during the original period 
of availability: Provided, That such designated funds that continue to 
be available for an additional fiscal year shall be obligated only for 
the purpose of such designation.
    (c) Ceilings and specifically designated funding levels contained
