        2023'' after ``after 1979'';
            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (E);

    ``(D)(i) In the case of an individual who initially becomes 
eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who dies 
(before becoming eligible for such benefits), in any calendar year 
after 2022, the primary insurance amount of the individual shall 
(except as provided in clause (vii)) be equal to the sum of the amounts 
determined under clause (ii) with respect to all of the individual's 
benefit computation years (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(B)).
    ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the amount determined 
under this clause with respect to a benefit computation year of an 
individual shall be equal to the quotient derived by dividing--
            ``(I) the product of the individual's covered earnings 
        ratio determined under clause (iii) for such benefit 
        computation year and the sum of--
                    ``(aa) 95 percent of the wages and self-employment 
                income of such individual credited for such computation 
                year (as adjusted under subsection (b)(3)) to the 
                extent that such wages and self-employment income do

                item by clause (iv),
                    ``(bb) 27.5 percent of such wages and self-
                employment income to the extent that such wages and 
                self-employment income exceed the amount established 
                for purposes of item (aa) but do not exceed the amount 
                established for purposes of this item by clause (iv),
                    ``(cc) 5 percent of such wages and self-employment 
                income to the extent that such wages and self-
                employment income exceed the amount established for 
                purposes of item (bb) but do not exceed the amount 
                established for purposes of this item by clause (iv),

        computation years (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(B)),
rounded, if not a multiple of $0.10, to the next lower multiple of 
$0.10, and thereafter increased as provided in subsection (i).
    ``(iii) An individual's covered earnings ratio for a benefit 
computation year is the ratio of--
            ``(I) the total (after adjustment under subsection (b)(3)) 
        of his wages paid in and self-employment income credited to 
        such benefit computation year (determined without regard to 
        clause (v)), to

        such benefit computation year (as determined under clause (v)).
    ``(iv) The amount established for purposes of items (aa), (bb), and 
(cc) of clause (ii)(I) shall be, respectively--
            ``(I) 25 percent of the national average wage index (as 
        defined in section 209(k)(1)) for the second calendar year 
        preceding the calendar year for which the determination is 
        made,

        so defined) for such calendar year, and
            ``(III) 125 percent of the national average wage index (as 
        so defined) for such calendar year.
    ``(v)(I) For purposes of determining an individual's primary 
insurance amount pursuant to clause (i), the total (after adjustment 
under subsection (b)(3)) of the individual's wages paid in and self-
employment income credited to a benefit computation year after 1977 
shall be determined by treating all recorded noncovered earnings (as 
defined in subclause (II)(aa)) derived by the individual from 
noncovered service performed in such benefit computation year as 
`wages' (as defined in section 209 for purposes of this title), which 
shall be treated as included in the individual's adjusted total covered 
earnings (as defined in subclause (II)(bb)) for such benefit 
computation year together with amounts consisting of `wages' (as so 
defined without regard to this subparagraph) paid in such benefit 
computation year and self-employment income (as defined in section 
211(b)) credited to such benefit computation year.
    ``(II) For purposes of this subparagraph--
            ``(aa) the term `recorded noncovered earnings' means 
        earnings derived from noncovered service (other than noncovered 
        service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in 
        section 210(m))) for which satisfactory evidence is determined 
        by the Commissioner to be available in the records of the 
        Commissioner, and
            ``(bb) the term `adjusted total covered earnings' means, in 
        connection with an individual for a benefit computation year, 
        the sum of the wages paid to the individual in such benefit 
        computation year (as adjusted under subsection (b)(3)) plus the 
        self-employment income derived by the individual credited to 
        such benefit computation year (as adjusted under subsection 
        (b)(3)).
    ``(III) The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide by 
regulation or other public guidance for methods for determining whether 
satisfactory evidence is available in the records of the Commissioner 
for earnings for noncovered service (other than noncovered service as a 
member of a uniformed service (as defined in section 210(m))) to be 
treated as recorded noncovered earnings. Such methods shall provide for 
reliance on earnings information which is provided to the Commissioner 
by employers and which, as determined by the Commissioner, constitute a 
reasonable basis for treatment of earnings for noncovered service as 
recorded noncovered earnings. In making determinations under this 
clause, the Commissioner shall also take into account any documentary 
or other evidence of earnings derived from noncovered service by an 
individual which is provided by the individual to the Commissioner and 
which the Commissioner considers appropriate as a reasonable basis for 
treatment of such earnings as recorded noncovered earnings.
    ``(vi) In the case of any individual whose primary insurance amount 
would be computed under this subparagraph who first becomes entitled 
after 1985 to a monthly periodic payment made by a foreign employer or 
foreign country that is based in whole or in part upon noncovered 
service, the primary insurance amount of such individual shall be 
determined under section 215 as such section was in effect on the day 
before the enactment of the Social Security Reform Act of 2016 for 
months beginning with the first month of the individual's initial 
entitlement to such monthly periodic payment.
    ``(vii) In the case of an individual who initially becomes eligible 
for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who dies (before 
becoming eligible for such benefits), in any year during the 9-year 
period beginning with 2023, the primary insurance amount of the 
individual shall be equal to the sum of--
            ``(I) the applicable percentage (specified for such year in 
        the table set forth in clause (viii)) of the individual's 
        primary insurance amount, as determined under this subparagraph 
        (other than this clause and clause (viii)) with the application 
        of clauses (i) through (vi) of this subparagraph, plus
            ``(II) a percentage, equal to the excess of 100 percent 
        over the applicable percentage, of the individual's primary 
        insurance amount, as determined under this paragraph (other 
        than this clause and clause (viii)) with the application of the 
        preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph (as if such preceding 
        subparagraphs applied for the individual and clauses (i) 
        through (vi) of this subparagraph did not apply),
rounded to the nearest $1, except that any amount so established which 
is a multiple of $0.50 but not of $1, shall be rounded to the next
