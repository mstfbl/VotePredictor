        taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments)'';
            (2) by inserting at the end the following new paragraphs:
            ``(3) Upfront premium charge for financing alterations, 
        repairs, improvements, or conversions.--In addition to the

        loan, advance of credit, or purchase in connection with 
        insurance granted under subparagraph (A)(i) or subparagraph (B) 
        of subsection (b)(1), the Secretary may, at the time of the 
        making of the loan, advance of credit, or purchase, charge a 
        single premium payment in an amount not to exceed 2.75 percent 
        of the amount of the original insured principal obligation. 
        Such premium charge shall be payable in advance by the 
        financial institution in such manner as may be prescribed by 
        the Secretary.
            ``(4) Increase in premium charge limitations for financing

        Secretary may increase the limitations on premium payments to 
        percentages greater than those set forth in paragraphs (1) and 
        (3), but only if necessary, and not in excess of the minimum 
        increase necessary (as determined based upon risk to the 
        Federal Government under existing underwriting requirements) to 
        maintain a negative credit subsidy for insurance of loans, 
        advances of credit, or purchases under subparagraph (A)(i) or
