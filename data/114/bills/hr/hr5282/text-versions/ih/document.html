SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) General findings.--
                    (A) Consumer reporting agencies (``CRAs'') are 
                companies that collect, compile, and provide 
                information about consumers in the form of consumer 
                reports, commonly referred to as credit reports for 
                certain permissible statutory purposes. Data 
                furnishers, such as creditors, lenders, and debt 
                collection agencies, voluntarily submit information to 
                CRAs such as the total amount for each loan or credit 
                limit for each credit card and the consumer's payment 
                history on these products. These reports may also 
                include information about companies that have asked to 
                see a consumer's credit report, addresses, current and 
                previous employers, and certain public records. The 
                largest CRAs in this country are referred to as 
                nationwide CRAs, which currently include Equifax, 
                TransUnion, and Experian.
                    (B) In a December 2012 paper, ``Key Dimensions and 
                Processes in the U.S. Credit Reporting System: A review 
                for how the nation's largest credit bureaus manage 
                consumer data'', the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
                Protection (``CFPB'' or the ``Bureau'') noted that the 
                three nationwide CRAs maintain credit files on 
                approximately 200 million adults and receive 
                information from about 10,000 furnishers. On a monthly 
                basis, these furnishers provide information on over 1.3 
                billion consumer credit accounts or other tradelines.
                    (C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing credit 
                information to each of the nationwide CRAs account for 
                more than half of all accounts reflected in consumers' 
                credit files.
                    (D) Consumer reports play an increasingly important 
                role in the lives of American consumers as most 
                creditors are reviewing these reports to make decisions 
                about whether to extend credit and on what terms and 
                conditions. As such, information contained in a 
                person's credit report not only can affect whether a 
                person is able to get a private education to pay for 
                college costs, secure a mortgage to buy a home, or to 
                obtain a credit card, but also can affect the 
                consumer's cost of borrowing.
                    (E) Consumer reports are also increasingly used for 
                noncredit decisions, including by landlords to 
                determine whether to rent an apartment to a prospective 
                tenant and by employers to decide whether to hire 
                potential job applicants.
                    (F) Pursuant to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting 
                Act (``FCRA''), CRAs have a statutory obligation to 
                verify independently the accuracy and completeness of 
                information included on the reports that they provide.
                    (G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to establish 
                and follow reasonable procedures, as required by 
                existing law, to establish the maximum level of 
                accuracy of information contained on consumer reports. 
                Given the repeated failures of CRAs to comply with 
                accuracy requirements on their own, legislation is 
                intended to provide them with detailed guidance 
                improving the accuracy and completeness of information 
                contained in consumer reports, including procedures, 
                policies, and practices that these CRAs should already 
                be following to ensure full compliance with their 
                existing obligations.
                    (H) The presence of inaccurate or incomplete 
                information on a person's report may result in 
                substantial financial and emotional harm. Credit 
                reporting errors can lead to the loss of new employment 
                opportunities or a denial of a promotion in an existing 
                job, the inability to obtain credit on favorable terms, 
                the inability to secure rental housing, the mental 
                distress of trying unsuccessfully to remove errors from 
                one's credit report, among other types of harm.
                    (I) Current industry practices impose an unfair 
                burden of proof on consumers when trying to fix errors 
                on their reports.
                    (J) Consumer reports containing inaccurate or 
                incomplete credit information undermine the ability of 
                creditors and lenders to effectively and accurately 
                underwrite and price credit.
                    (K) Recognizing that credit reporting affects the 
                lives of most Americans and that the consequences of 
                errors on a consumer report can be catastrophic for a 
                consumer the Bureau began accepting consumer's 
                complaints about credit reporting in October 2012.
                    (L) As of August 2015, the Bureau has handled 
                approximately 105,500 credit reporting complaints, 
                making credit reporting the third most-complained-about 
                subject matter on which the Bureau accepts consumer 
                complaints. The most common credit reporting problems 
                identified by consumers relate to incorrect information 
                contained on consumer reports (comprising a staggering 
                77 percent) and CRAs investigations (consisting of 9 
                percent). Other complaints involve the inability to 
                obtain a report or score, the improper use of reports, 
                and credit monitoring or identity protection products 
                and services.
                    (M) The Bureau indicated in its ``Monthly Complaint 
                Report Volume 2'' released in August 2015 that credit 
                reporting complaints showed the greatest month-over-
                month percentage increase (56 percent) as compared to 
                the other consumer complaints which the Bureau 
                currently tracks.
                    (N) The Bureau's summer 2015 ``Supervisory 
                Highlights'' publication found that one or more of the 
                largest CRAs failed to adequately oversee furnishers to 
                ensure they were adhering to the CRAs vetting policies 
                and to establish proper procedures to verify public 
                record information.
                    (O) A February 2014 Bureau report titled ``Credit 
                Reporting Complaint Snapshot'' found that consumers are 
                confused about the extent to which the nationwide CRAs 
                are required to provide them with validation and 
                documentation of a debt which appears on their credit 
                report.
                    (P) As evidence that the current system lacks 
                sufficient market incentives for CRAs to develop more 
                robust procedures to increase the accuracy and 
                completeness of information on credit reports, 
                litigation discovery documented by the National 
                Consumer Law Center, as part of a January 2009 report 
                entitled ``Automated Injustice: How a Mechanized 
                Dispute System Frustrates Consumers Seeking to Fix 
                Errors in Their Credit Reports'', showed that at least 
                two of the three largest CRAs use quota systems to 
                force employees to process disputes hastily and without 
                the opportunity for conducting meaningful 
                investigations. At least one nationwide CRA only 
                allowed dispute resolution staff five minutes to handle 
                a consumer's call. Furthermore, these CRAs were found 
                to award bonuses for meeting quotas and punish those 
                who didn't meet production numbers with probation.
                    (Q) Unlike most other business relationships, where 
                consumers can register their satisfaction or 
                dissatisfaction with a particular product or service by 
                taking their business elsewhere, consumers have no say 
                in whether their information is included in the CRAs 
                databases and limited legal remedies to hold the CRAs 
                accountable for inaccuracies or poor service.
                    (R) Accordingly, despite the existing statutory 
                mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable procedures to 
                assure the maximum possible accuracy of the information 
                whenever they prepare consumer reports, numerous 
                studies and the high volume of consumer complaints 
                submitted to the Bureau about incorrect information on 
                consumer reports demonstrates that these CRAs continue 
                to skirt their obligations under the law, year after 
                year.
            (2) Incorrect information on consumer reports.--
                    (A) Consumers are entitled to dispute errors on 
                their consumer reports with either the CRA or directly 
                with furnishers and request mistakes be deleted or 
                removed. Consumers who believe an investigation has not 
                correctly resolved their dispute have few options other 
                than requesting that a statement about the dispute be 
                included with their future reports.
                    (B) CRAs have a statutory obligation under the FCRA 
                to conduct a reasonable investigation by conducting a 
                substantive and searching inquiry when a consumer 
                disputes an item on their report. In doing so, CRAs 
                must conduct an independent review about the accuracy 
                of any disputed item and cannot merely rely on a 
                furnisher's rubber-stamp verification of the integrity 
                of the information they have provided to CRAs.
                    (C) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in a 
                ``Report to Congress Under Section 319 of the Fair and 
                Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003'' released in 
                December 2012 found that 26 percent of survey 
                participants identified at least one potentially 
                material error on their consumer reports, and 13 
                percent experienced a change in their credit score once 
                the error was fixed.
                    (D) Bureau examiners have identified repeated 
                deficiencies with the nationwide CRAs' information 
                collection. In the summer 2015 ``Supervisory 
                Highlights'' released in June 2015, the Bureau noted 
                continued weaknesses with CRAs' methods and processes 
                for assuring maximum possible accuracy in consumer 
                reports. Bureau examiners found, with certain 
                exceptions, no quality control policies and procedures 
                to test consumer reports for accuracy.
                    (E) In its ``Credit Reporting Complaint Snapshot'' 
                released in February 2014, the Bureau found that 
                consumers were uncertain about the depth and validity 
                of the investigations performed. Consumers also 
                expressed frustration that even though they provided 
                supporting materials that they believed demonstrated 
                the inaccuracy of the information provided by 
                furnishers, errors continued to remain on their 
                reports.
                    (F) Bureau examiners noted in the winter 2015 
                ``Supervisory Highlights'' released in March 2015 that 
                one or more nationwide CRAs failed to adequately 
                fulfill their dispute-handling obligations, including 
                by not forwarding all relevant information found in 
                letters and supporting documents supplied by consumers 
                when they submitted disputes to furnishers, failing to 
                notify consumers that they had completed their 
                investigations, and not providing consumers with the 
                results of the CRAs' reviews about their dispute 
                claims.
                    (G) Consumers' increasing frustration about the 
                difficulties of trying to fix credit reporting evidence 
                through the volume of consumer complaints errors 
                submitted to the Bureau, are also echoed in another FTC 
                study on credit report accuracy issued in January 2015. 
                In the ``Report to Congress under Section 319 for the 
                Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003'', 
                the FTC found that nearly 70 percent (84 people) of 
                participants from a previous survey that had filed 
                disputes with CRAs continued to believe that at least 
                some of the disputed information remained inaccurate at 
                the time of the follow-up survey. Despite these views, 
                50 percent (42 people) of the survey participants 
                decided to just give up trying to fix the errors, with 
                only 45 percent (38 people) of them planning to 
                continue to try to resolve their disputes.
                    (H) The increasing number of consumer complaints 
                about incorrect information to the Bureau, coupled with 
                the largest CRAs' repeated quality control weaknesses 
                found by Bureau examiners, show that the nationwide 
                CRAs have failed to establish and follow reasonable 
                procedures to assure maximum accuracy of information 
                and to conduct independent investigations of consumers' 
                dispute claims. These ongoing problems demonstrate the 
                need for legislation to--
                            (i) enhance obligations on furnishers to 
                        substantiate information and require furnishers 
                        to keep records for the same amount of time 
                        that adverse information about these accounts 
                        may appear on a person's consumer report;
                            (ii) eliminate CRAs' discretion to 
                        determine the relevancy of materials provided 
                        by consumers to support their dispute claims by 
                        instead requiring them to pass all material 
                        onto furnishers and eliminating their 
                        discretion to deem some disputes frivolous or 
                        irrelevant when a consumer resubmits a claim 
                        that they believe has been inadequately 
                        resolved;
                            (iii) enhance educational content on CRAs' 
                        websites to improve consumers' understanding of 
                        the dispute process and to make it easier for 
                        all consumers to initiate claims, including by 
                        providing these disclosures in other languages 
                        besides English; and
                            (iv) create a new consumer right to appeal 
                        reviews by CRAs and furnishers of the initial 
                        disputes.
            (3) Injunctive relief.--
                    (A) Despite the fact that the FCRA currently 
                provides implicit authority for injunctive relief, 
                consumers have been prevented from exercising this 
                right. Legislation explicitly clarifying this right is 
                intended to underscore congressional intent that 
                injunctive relief should be viewed as a remedy 
                available to consumers.
                    (B) Myriad findings by the courts, regulators, 
                consumers, and consumer advocates make clear that CRAs 
                have failed to establish adequate standards for the 
                accuracy and completeness of consumer reports, yet the 
                nationwide CRAs have demonstrated little willingness to 
                retool their policies and procedures to fix the 
                problems.
                    (C) Providing courts with explicit authority to 
                issue injunctive relief, by telling the CRAs to remedy 
                unlawful practices and procedures, would further CRAs' 
                mandate under the FCRA to assure the maximum possible 
                accuracy and completeness of credit reports.
                    (D) Absent explicit authority to issue injunctions, 
                history suggests that the nationwide CRAs are likely to 
                continue conducting business as usual; dismissing any 
                monetary settlements with individual consumers and 
                State attorneys general as the cost of doing business.
            (4) Use of credit reports for employment purposes.--
                    (A) The use of credit reports as a factor in making 
                hiring decisions has been found to be prevalent in a 
                diverse array of occupations and is not limited to 
                high-level positions.
                    (B) According to the California Labor Federation, 
                only 25 percent of employers researched the credit 
                history of job applicants in 1998. However, this 
                practice had increased to 43 percent by 2006 and to 60 
                percent by 2011.
                    (C) A study entitled, ``Do Job Applicant Credit 
                Histories Predict Job Performance Appraisal Ratings or 
                Termination Decisions?'' published in 2012 found that, 
                while credit history might conceptually measure a 
                person's level of responsibility, ability to meet 
                deadlines, dependability, or integrity, it does not, in 
                practice, actually predict an employee's performance or 
                turnover because credit reports contain many 
                inaccuracies and credit history can be contaminated by 
                events outside a person's control, such as the effects 
                of divorce, death, and accidents on a person's finances 
                and ability to meet deadlines, past youthful naivety, 
                and economic shocks. The study found that there is no 
                benefit from using credit history to predict job 
                performance or turnover.
                    (D) Despite the absence of data showing a 
                correlation between job performance and credit 
                worthiness, employers continue to use credit checks as 
                a proxy for assessing character and integrity. 
                According to a 2012 Society for Human Resource 
                Management survey, organizations indicated that they 
                used credit checks on job candidates primarily to 
                reduce or prevent theft and embezzlement and to 
                minimize legal liability for negligent hiring.
                    (E) The use of credit checks for employment 
                purposes creates a true ``catch-22'' for unemployed 
                people with impaired credit. For example, the financial 
                hardship caused by losing a job may cause some 
                unemployed individuals to make late or partial payments 
                on their bills, but their poor credit standing caused 
                by this negative information on their consumer report 
                can impede their chances of obtaining a new job to end 
                the financial distress.
                    (F) A September 2014 report by the New York City 
                Council's Committee on Civil Rights noted that, for 
                those who have been unemployed for an extended period 
                of time and whose credit has suffered as they fell 
                behind on bills, the use of credit reports in the 
                hiring process can exacerbate and perpetuate an already 
                precarious situation.
                    (G) A March 2013 Demos report titled ``Discredited: 
                How Employment Credit Checks Keep Out Qualified Workers 
                Out of a Job'' found that one in four survey 
                participants who were unemployed said that a potential 
                employer had requested to check their credit report as 
                part of a job application. Among job applicants with 
                blemished credit histories, one in seven had been 
                advised that they were not being hired because of their 
                credit history.
                    (H) While job applicants must give prior approval 
                for a current or prospective employer to pull their 
                credit reports under the FCRA, as a practical matter, 
                this authorization does not constitute an effective 
                consumer protection because an employer may reject any 
                job applicant who refuses a credit check.
                    (I) Credit reports generally do not reflect the 
                uncontrollable circumstances that may have contributed 
                to or caused a person's debts or late payments, such as 
                the loss of a job, a medical crisis, or a divorce.
                    (J) In October 2011, FICO noted that from 2008 to 
                2009, approximately 50 million people experienced a 20-
                point drop in their credit scores and about 21 million 
                saw their scores decline by more than 50 points. While 
                the Great Recession reduced many consumers' credit 
                scores due to foreclosures and other financial 
                hardships, the financial crisis had a particularly 
                harsh impact on Latinos and African-Americans, as 
                racial and ethnic minorities and communities of color 
                were frequently targeted by predatory mortgage lenders 
                who steered them into high-cost, subprime loans even 
                when these borrowers would have qualified for prime 
                credit.
                    (K) A May 2006 Brookings Institution report titled 
                ``Credit Scores, Reports, and Getting Ahead in 
                America'' found that counties with a relatively higher 
                proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the 
                United States tended to have lower credit scores as 
                compared with counties that had a lower concentration 
                of communities of color.
                    (L) Because Latino and African-American households 
                tend, on average, to have lower credit scores than 
                White households, credit checks may disproportionately 
                screen minorities out of jobs, leading to 
                discriminatory hiring practices, and further 
                exacerbating the trend where unemployment for Latino 
                and African-American communities is elevated well above 
                the rate of Whites.
                    (M) A 2012 Demos survey found that 65 percent of 
                White respondents reported having good or excellent 
                credit scores, while over half of African-American 
                households reported having fair or bad credit.
            (5) Private education loans.--
                    (A) The Bureau's October 2014 report titled 
                ``Annual Report of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman'' 
                noted many private education loan borrowers who sought 
                to negotiate a modified repayment plan when they were 
                experiencing a period of financial distress were unable 
                to get such assistance from their loan holders, often 
                resulting in them defaulting on their loans. This 
                pattern closely resembles the difficulty that a 
                significant number of mortgage loan borrowers 
                experienced when they sought to take responsible steps 
                to work with their mortgage servicer to avoid 
                foreclosure during the Great Recession.
                    (B) Although private student loan holders may allow 
                a borrower to postpone payments while enrolled in 
                school full-time, many limit this option to a certain 
                time period, usually 48 to 66 months. This limited time 
                period may not be sufficient for those who need 
                additional time to obtain their degree or who want to 
                continue their education by pursing a graduate or 
                professional degree. The Bureau found that borrowers 
                who were unable to make payments often defaulted or had 
                their accounts sent to collections before they were 
                able to graduate.
            (6) Deceptive practices at certain proprietary education 
        institutions and career education programs.--
                    (A) The for-profit college sector has come under 
                heavy State and Federal scrutiny after the closure and 
                bankruptcy of Corinthian Colleges, which was found to 
                have deceived students by steering them into high-
                interest student loans based on graduation rates and 
                employment data. Even after its closure, Corinthian 
                students remain saddled with debt, worthless degrees, 
                and few prospects for employment.
                    (B) Attending a two-year, for-profit college costs, 
                on average, four times as much as attending a community 
                college. Students at for-profit colleges represent only 
                about 11 percent of the total higher education 
                population but a startling 44 percent of all Federal 
                student loan defaults, according to the United States 
                Department of Education (``DOE'').
                    (C) As highlighted in a press release titled, 
                ``Obama Administration Announces Final Rules to Protect 
                Students from Poor-Performing Career College Programs'' 
                that was issued by the DOE on October 30, 2014, ``[t]oo 
                often, students at career colleges--including thousands 
                of veterans--are charged excessive costs, but don't get 
                the education they paid for. Instead, students in such 
                programs are provided with poor quality training, often 
                for low-wage jobs or in occupations where there are 
                simply no job opportunities. They find themselves with 
                large amounts of debt and, too often, end up in 
                default. In many cases, students are drawn into these 
                programs with confusing or misleading information.''.
            (7) Medical debt.--
                    (A) The Bureau's research on credit reporting and 
                credit scoring has found that the inclusion of medical 
                debt collection information on consumer reports has 
                unfairly reduced consumers' credit scores.
                    (B) The Bureau's review of 5 million anonymized 
                credit files from September 2011 to September 2013 
                found that credit scores may underestimate a person's 
                creditworthiness by up to 10 points for those who owe 
                medical debt, and may underestimate a person's 
                creditworthiness by up to 22 points after the medical 
                debt has been paid. For consumers with lower credit 
                scores, especially those on the brink of what is 
                considered subprime, a 10 to 22 point decrease in their 
                credit scores can have a significant impact on their 
                lives, including by affecting whether they are able to 
                qualify for credit and, if so, the terms and conditions 
                under which it is extended to them. The differences in 
                peoples' credit scores because of medical debt could 
                unfairly cost them tens of thousands of dollars on 
                large loans such as mortgages.
                    (C) The Bureau found that half of all collections 
                tradelines that appear on consumer reports are related 
                to medical bills claimed to be owed to hospitals and 
                other medical providers. These tradelines affect the 
                credit reports of nearly \1/5\ of all consumers in the 
                credit reporting system.
                    (D) The Bureau concluded that there are no 
                objective or enforceable standards that determine when 
                a debt can or should be reported as a collection 
                tradeline. Because debt buyers and collectors determine 
                whether, when, and for how long to report a collection 
                account, there is only a limited relationship between 
                the time period reported, the severity of a 
                delinquency, and when or whether a collection tradeline 
                appears on a consumer's credit report.
                    (E) Medical patients may be uncertain about what 
                they owe, to whom, when, or for what, causing some 
                consumers who ordinarily pay their bills on time to 
                delay or withhold payments on medical debts. In many 
                instances, consumers' uncertainty about medical bills 
                can result in medical debt collections appearing on 
                their consumer reports. In a December 2014 report 
                titled ``Consumer Credit Reports: A Study of Medical 
                and Non-Medical Collections'', the Bureau found that a 
                large portion of consumers with medical debts in 
                collections show no other evidence of financial 
                distress and are consumers who ordinarily pay their 
                other financial obligations on time. Unlike credit 
                cards, installment loans, utilities, or wireless or 
                cable services that have contractual account 
                disclosures describing terms and conditions of use, 
                most consumers are not told what their out-of-pocket 
                medical costs will be in advance. Consumers needing 
                urgent or emergency care rarely know, or are provided, 
                the cost of a treatment or procedure before the service 
                is rendered.
                    (F) The Bureau concluded that the presence of 
                medical collections is less predictive of future 
                defaults or serious delinquencies than the presence of 
                a nonmedical collection in a study titled ``Data Point: 
                Medical Debt and Credit Scores'' issued in May 2014.
                    (G) In March 2013, VantageScore released a new 
                credit scoring model (VantageScore 3.0) that excludes 
                all paid collections. In April 2014, FICO announced 
                that its new credit scoring model (FICO '09) excludes 
                any record of a consumer failing to pay a bill if the 
                bill has been paid or settled with a collection agency 
                and also gives less weight to unpaid medical bills that 
                are with a collection agency. Many Americans, 
                therefore, could see significant improvements in their 
                credit scores if creditors and lenders used the latest 
                versions of credit scoring models that treat medical 
                debt differently.
            (8) Financial abuse by known persons.--
                    (A) Financial abuse is frequently associated with 
                domestic violence. Financial abuse in a relationship 
                may result in fraudulent charges to a credit card, or 
                having fraudulent loans taken out or accounts created 
                by the abuser in the survivor's name. Financial abuse 
                may also result in the survivor's inability to make 
                valid payments because of lost income when the abuser 
                steals from or coerces the survivor to relinquish their 
                paychecks.
                    (B) By racking up substantial debts in the 
                survivor's name, abusers are able to exercise control 
                and make it harder for the survivor, whose credit is 
                often destroyed in the process, to escape.
                    (C) Domestic abuse survivors with tarnished credit 
                reports are likely to face significant obstacles in 
                establishing financial independence from their abusers. 
                This is because credit reports often determine a 
                consumer's ability to obtain a checking account, 
                housing, insurance, utilities, employment, and even a 
                security clearance as required for certain jobs.
                    (D) While in many cases, identity thieves are 
                individuals who are actually known to the survivor, 
                providing documentation of identity theft in order to 
                dispute information on one's consumer report can be 
                particularly challenging for those who know their 
                financial abuser.
                    (E) While it is easier for consumers who obtain a 
                police report to remove fraudulent information from 
                their consumer report and prevent it from reappearing 
                in the future, according to the Empire Justice Center, 
                safety and other noncredit concerns may prevent a 
                survivor of financial abuse involving a known person 
                from involving the police.
                    (F) According to domestic violence advocates at the 
                Legal Aid Society in New York, domestic abuse survivors 
                seeking to remove adverse information stemming from 
                financial abuse by contacting their creditors directly 
                are likely to face skepticism about claims of identity 
                theft perpetrated by a spouse because of an assumption 
                that the individual was aware of and may have been 
                complicit in the activity which the survivor alleges 
                stems from financial abuse.
            (9) GSE's impact on the use of updated versions or 
        additional credit scoring models by mortgage lenders.--
                    (A) Despite innovation in understanding consumer 
                behavior and credit scoring analytics, many creditors 
                and lenders, particularly mortgage lenders, continue to 
                use older versions of credit scoring models and 
                algorithms.
                    (B) Lenders that originate residential mortgage 
                loans generally adhere to the underwriting guidelines 
                set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which reference the 
                2004 FICO credit scoring model (developed more than a 
                decade ago), not the most recent version developed in 
                2009 (that was released in 2014).
                    (C) Despite changes in recent years to credit 
                scoring models offered by major credit scoring 
                developers VantageScore and FICO to reflect current 
                research about consumer behavior and creditworthiness, 
                it is likely that paid collections (medical or 
                otherwise) will continue to be factored into the risk 
                level of each consumer shopping for credit because only 
                a small percentage of creditors may actually be using 
                the latest models.
            (10) Consumers' confusion about consumer reports and credit 
        scores.--
                    (A) A July 2011 Bureau report titled ``The Impact 
                of Differences between Consumer- and Creditor-Purchased 
                Credit Scores'' found that the credit scores made 
                available to and purchased by consumers are unlikely to 
                be the same credit scores used by creditors and 
                lenders.
                    (B) That report found that the scarcity of public 
                educational tools to inform consumers of the 
                differences among credit scores, the large combined 
                market share and brand recognition of FICO credit 
                scores, and the marketing practices of some credit 
                score sellers may perpetuate consumers' confusion about 
                credit scores. Consumers may be purchasing an 
                educational credit score or subscribing to a credit 
                monitoring service sold by CRAs without realizing the 
                limitations and usefulness of these products and 
                services.
                    (C) A September 2012 Bureau report titled 
                ``Analysis of Differences between Consumer- and 
                Creditor-Purchased Credit Scores'' found different 
                types of scores, such as those provided by FICO, 
                VantageScore, or other educational scores, vary 
                greatly. The report noted that consumers do not know 
                before they purchase a score from a CRA whether this 
                score will closely track or vary significantly from the 
                score sold to creditors or lenders. Due to this lack of 
                transparency and the resulting consumer confusion, the 
                Bureau recommended that companies selling scores to 
                consumers inform them that the scores that they are 
                purchasing can vary, sometimes substantially, from the 
                scores that are sold to and used by creditors and 
                lenders. Absent increased transparency a substantial 
                number of consumers will continue to hold misleading 
                and inaccurate views of their own creditworthiness that 
                may impact how and whether they shop for credit.
                    (D) In February 2011, a Consumer Federation of 
                America and VantageScore study also found that the 
                general public lacks a clear understanding of what 
                credit scores represent. The report found that half of 
                the consumers surveyed did not know that a credit score 
                is designed to indicate the risk of not repaying a 
                loan. Consumers also did not know who makes credit 
                scores available, what numerical range constitutes 
                excellent credit standing, or the financial 
                implications of having a low credit score.
                    (E) Many consumers do not realize that they have 
                more than just ``one'' credit score. Because the 
                submission of credit information to CRAs is voluntary 
                and not all furnishers submit information to every CRA, 
                the information contained in a consumer's credit report 
                also varies among CRAs. As a result, the credit score 
                generated by each CRA is likely to vary, resulting in 
                potentially different credit decisions based on an 
                evaluation of different credit reports obtained from 
                different CRAs.
                    (F) A February 2015 Bureau report titled ``Consumer 
                Voices on Credit Reports and Scores'' found that 
                consumers had questions about what actions to take to 
                improve their scores once they had seen them, 
                suggesting that additional disclosures and educational 
                content is necessary. The Bureau found that consumers 
                were confused by conflicting advice on how to improve 
                their scores.
                    (G) That report noted that consumers found the 
                process for obtaining consumer reports and credit 
                scores confusing. Consumers also were uncertain whether 
                and under what circumstances they could obtain a 
                consumer report for free.
            (11) Deceptive and misleading marketing practices.--
                    (A) The Bureau's February 2015 report titled 
                ``Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and Scores'' found 
                that some consumers did not check their consumer report 
                because of concerns about security or being trapped 
                into purchasing unwanted products like an additional 
                report or a credit monitoring service.
                    (B) CRAs frequently lure consumers into purchasing 
                products and services that they may not want or need by 
                offering such products or services ``free of charge'' 
                for an introductory trial period before such products 
                automatically convert into an ongoing subscription 
                service at the regular price until the offer is 
                cancelled.
                    (C) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer reports in 
                consumers' lives and the fact that consumers' 
                participation in the credit reporting system is 
                involuntary, CRAs should prioritize providing consumers 
                with the effective means to safeguard their personal 
                and financial information and improve their credit 
                standing, rather than seeking to exploit consumers' 
                concerns for their companies' financial gain.
                    (D) Vulnerable consumers, who have legitimate 
                concerns about the security of their personal and 
                financial information, deserve clear, accurate, and 
                transparent information about the credit reporting 
                tools that may be available to them, such as fraud 
                alerts and audit freezes.
            (12) Loan comparison shopping.--
                    (A) The Bureau's February 2015 report titled 
                ``Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and Scores'' found 
                that while consumers stand to benefit when they shop 
                for credit, some consumers are reluctant to shop for 
                loans and other types of consumer credit products out 
                of fear that in doing so they will harm their credit 
                scores.
                    (B) The Bureau found that one of the most common 
                barriers for people in reviewing their own consumer 
                reports and shopping for the best credit terms was a 
                lack of understanding of the differences between 
                ``soft'' and ``hard'' inquiries and whether requesting 
                a copy of their own consumer report adversely impacts 
                their credit.
                    (C) The Bureau revealed that a consumer with an 
                accurate perception of his or her credit standing may 
                be better equipped to shop for favorable credit terms.
            (13) Protections for consumers' credit information.--
                    (A) Despite heightened awareness, incidents of 
                identity theft continue to rise. In February 2015 the 
                FTC reported that identity theft was the top consumer 
                complaint that it received for the 15th consecutive 
                year. As these incidents continue to rise, consumers 
                experience significant financial loss and emotional 
                distress from the inability to safeguard effectively 
                and inexpensively their credit information from bad 
                actors.
                    (B) According to Javelin Strategy & Research's 2015 
                Identity Fraud study, $16 billion was stolen by 
                fraudsters from 12.7 million American consumers in 
                2014. Similarly, the United States Department of 
                Justice found an estimated 7 percent of all United 
                States residents age 16 or older (about 17.6 million 
                persons) were victims of one or more incidents of ID 
                theft in 2014, and the number of elderly victims age 65 
                or older (about 86 percent) increased from 2.1 million 
                in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2014.
                    (C) Consumers report that they are extremely 
                worried about the security of their financial 
                information. According to a 2015 MasterCard survey, a 
                majority of consumers (77 percent) are anxious about 
                their financial information and Social Security numbers 
                being stolen or compromised, with about 55 percent of 
                consumers indicating that they would rather have naked 
                pictures of themselves leaked online than have their 
                financial information stolen.
                    (D) The 2015 MasterCard survey revealed that 
                consumers' concerns about the online security of their 
                financial information even outweighed consumers' 
                worries about other physical security dangers such as 
                having their houses robbed (59 percent) or being 
                pickpocketed (46 percent).
                    (E) Despite the increasing risks consumers face, 
                there is no Federal requirement that ensures victims, 
                the elderly and other vulnerable consumers have access 
                to credit freezes, the best tool for protecting against 
                new account fraud, free of charge. Nor is there a 
                Federal requirement to ensure that consumers regardless 
                of where they live can proactively place a credit 
                freeze on their consumer report to guard against the 
                risk of identity theft and fraud for a fair and 
                reasonable fee.
                    (F) As a result of varying State laws, many 
                consumers may be unable to quickly lift a credit freeze 
                they place on their consumer report, either for a 
                specific creditor or category of creditors, when the 
                time comes for the consumer to obtain credit. Indeed, 
                many consumers may not be taking advantage of existing 
                credit freeze rights provided at the State level if 
                they perceive the benefits of this protection to be 
                outweighed by the burden associated with using it.
                    (G) According to Consumer Reports, roughly 50 
                million American consumers spent about 3.5 billion in 
                2010 to purchase products aimed at protecting their 
                identity, with the annual cost of the services ranging 
                from $120 to $300. As risks to consumers' personal and 
                financial information continue to grow, consumers need 
                additional protections to ensure that they have fair 
                and reasonable access to the full suite of identity 
                theft and fraud prevention measures that may be right 
                for them.

                the date on which the consumer reporting agency 
                notified any person who provided any item of

    ``(a) Validated Credit Scoring Models.--Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this section, the Bureau shall issue final 
regulations applicable to a person that creates, maintains, or 
purchases credit scoring models used in making credit decisions to 
establish standards for validating the accuracy and predictive value of 
all such credit scoring models, both before release for initial use and 
at regular intervals thereafter, for as long as such credit scoring 
models are made available for purchase or use by such person.
    ``(b) Prohibition.--At least once every 2 years, the Bureau shall 
conduct a review of credit scoring models to determine whether the use 
of any particular factors, or the weight or consideration given to 
certain factors by credit scoring models, is inappropriate, including 
if such factors do not enhance or contribute to the accuracy and 
predictive value of the models. Upon the conclusion of its review, the 
Bureau may prohibit a person described in subsection (a) from weighing, 
considering, or including certain factors in, or making available for 
purchase or use, certain credit scoring models or versions, as the 
Bureau determines appropriate.

1681a)) used to establish the eligibility criteria for loans purchased 
by the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation. Such review shall analyze--
            (1) the impact of using such credit scoring models on the 
        accuracy and predictive value of the performance of loans

        Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation;
            (2) the ability of the Federal National Mortgage 
        Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to 
        more effectively manage credit risks by adopting additional,

Finance Agency shall seek public input about the methodology and 
research design of the review described in subsection (a), including

depository institutions and credit unions that primarily serve 
traditionally underserved communities.

beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 2 years 
thereafter, the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency shall 
issue a report to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate containing all findings and determinations made 
in carrying out the review required under subsection (a).
    (d) Implementation of Findings.--If the Director of the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency determines, in consultation with the Bureau, 
that the advantages of implementing additional, alternative, or updated 
credit scoring models outweigh the disadvantages, the Director shall 
promptly require the Federal National Mortgage Association and the 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to revise their seller-servicer 
guidelines to allow for the use of such additional, alternative, or 
updated credit scoring models, and any other guidelines as the Director 
determines appropriate, in a manner consistent with the determination 
of the Director.

              OF USING NON-TRADITIONAL DATA.

credit by the inclusion of non-traditional data on a consumer report 
(as defined in section 603 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 
1681a)) used in connection with a credit transaction involving the 
extension of credit to, or review or collection of an account of, the 
consumer, including a review of the advantages or disadvantages to 
consumers with minimal traditional credit history, traditionally 
underserved communities and populations, and racial and ethnic 
minorities.

the date of the enactment of this Act, the Bureau shall issue a report 
to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives

    Section 609(f) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.

            ``(5) Website disclaimer.--A consumer reporting agency that 
        generates or provides credit scores or educational credit 
        scores shall clearly and conspicuously display on the home page

        application, solicitation, or marketing material or media 
        providing information related to a credit score or educational 
        credit score, the following notice, in boldface type of 18-
        point font or larger and in a text box with boldface outer 
        borders:

```CREDIT SCORE DISCLAIMER.

    ```There is no ``one'' credit score. There are many scoring 
formulas derived from a wide variety of models available to a consumer 
and used by lenders and creditors. Different lenders and creditors use 
different scoring formulas to determine whether to extend credit or 
make a loan to you, and the terms of the credit or loan. An educational 
credit score is not a credit score that a person who makes a loan or 
extends credit to you is likely to use. Educational credit scores are 
merely intended to be used as an educational tool to help consumers 
understand how the information contained in a consumer report may 
affect the terms and conditions of a loan or extension of credit that 
may be available to a consumer. Lenders and creditors may also rely on 
information not contained in your consumer report and not reflected in 
the calculation of your credit score.'.

        scores.--
                    ``(A) Disclaimer.--If an educational credit score

                boldface type of 18-point font or larger, and in a text 
                box with boldface outer borders, the following notice:

```EDUCATIONAL CREDIT SCORE DISCLAIMER.

    ```The educational credit score provided to you is not a credit 
score that a lender or creditor is likely to use to make a loan or 
extend credit to you. There are many different credit scores derived 
from a wide variety of models used by lenders and creditors. An 
educational credit score is merely an educational tool. It is intended 
to provide consumers with a basic understanding of how the information 
contained in a consumer report may affect the terms and conditions of 
credit that are available. The credit scores you receive directly from 
different lenders and creditors may not be the same as an educational 
credit score. There are a number of reasons for this:
            ```(1) Each company may use a different formula for 
        calculating credit scores and the differences in the formulas 
        may lead to differences in your scores.
            ```(2) Companies may produce scores that give results on 
        different scales.
            ```(3) Not all lenders or creditors report to every 
        consumer reporting agency, and therefore the information 
        contained in your consumer report that the consumer reporting 
        agencies use to calculate your educational credit score may 
        differ among agencies.'.
                    ``(B) Prohibition on misleading representations.--A 
                consumer reporting agency may not refer to an 
                educational credit score as a credit score in any 
                application, solicitation, marketing, or other 
                informational materials or media.

        the content, format, and manner of the disclaimers required 
        under paragraphs (5) and (6), if warranted, after conducting 
        consumer testing or research.''.

SEC. 805. REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF CONSUMER RIGHTS RELATED TO CREDIT 
              FREEZES.

    (a) Summary of Rights Related to Credit Freezes.--Section 609(c)(1) 
of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681g(c)(1)), as amended by 
section 105(d)(1)(C)(iv), is further amended by adding at the end the 
following new subparagraph:
                    ``(E) Summary of rights related to credit 
                freezes.--The Bureau shall publish, and consumer 
                reporting agencies described under section 603(p) shall 
                distribute to consumers, the following notice:

```CREDIT FREEZES.

    ```Consumers have the right to obtain a credit freeze under Federal 
law from any of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies. You have a 
right to place a credit freeze on your consumer report, which will 
prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your 
consumer report without your express authorization. A credit freeze may 
be requested in writing by mail, by toll-free telephone, or by 
electronic means as provided by a consumer reporting agency. A credit 
freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being 
approved in your name without your consent. If you are actively seeking 
a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you 
should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a credit 
freeze may slow your applications for such accounts and you should plan 
ahead and lift a freeze in advance of actually applying for any of 
these type of accounts. When you place a credit freeze on your consumer 
report, you will be provided a personal identification number or 
password to use if you choose to fully remove the freeze on your 
consumer report or temporarily authorize the release of your consumer 
report for a period of time after the freeze is in place to a specific 
party or parties. To provide that authorization you must contact each 
consumer reporting agency individually and provide your personal 
identification number or password, proper identification to verify your 
identity, and the period of time for which you would like the report to 
be available. A consumer reporting agency must authorize the release of 
your consumer report no later than 15 minutes after receiving the above 
information if the request is by toll-free telephone, or secure 
electronic means, and no later than one business day when a written 
request is submitted by mail. A credit freeze does not apply to a 
person or entity, or its affiliates or collection agencies acting on 
behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing 
account, that requests information in your consumer report for the 
purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account 
includes activities related to account maintenance. Unless you suspect 
you have been or are about to become a victim of identity theft, fraud, 
a related crime, or harmed by the unauthorized disclosure of your 
financial or personally identifiable information, are an active duty 
military servicemember, are 65 years of age or older, or as otherwise 
identified as an eligible consumer by the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge you a 
fee of no more than $3 dollars each time you place, temporarily lift, 
or fully remove a credit freeze. However, if you reside in a State that 
provides greater protections with respect to the circumstances, method, 
or frequency for obtaining a credit freeze than is available under the 
Federal law, those State protections and benefits will apply to 
you.'.''.
