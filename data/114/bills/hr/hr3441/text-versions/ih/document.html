            ``(2) enable the respective target audience to understand 
        the available options with regards to cell-free DNA prenatal 
        screenings, other prenatal screenings, and diagnostic tests;
            ``(3) promote the informed consent, and enhance the 
        decision-making processes of, the respective target audience 
        before and after such screenings;
