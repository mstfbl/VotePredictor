Secretary determines that the carrier could have prevented the crash.
    (b) Use of Safety Data.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out the CSA program, and to 
        prevent the misuse and misinterpretation of data by public

                    (A) shall use the safety data of a motor carrier 
                developed under the program solely for internal 
                purposes of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
                Administration, including allocating resources to 
                conduct audits and inspections of motor carriers; and
                    (B) may not make the scores available to the 
                public.
            (2) Safety fitness information.--Paragraph (1) may not be 
        construed to affect the responsibility of the Secretary under 
        section 31144(a)(3) of title 49, United States Code, to make 
        final safety fitness determinations readily available to the 
        public.

section, the term ``Compliance, Safety, Accountability program'' or

carried out by the Secretary, acting through the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration.
