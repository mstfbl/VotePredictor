construction of the project for up to four consecutive 2-year periods 
from the date of the expiration of the time period required for 
commencement of construction prescribed in the license.
    (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period required for 
commencement of construction of the project described in subsection (a) 
has expired prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Commission may reinstate the license effective as of the date of its 
expiration and the first extension authorized under subsection (a) 
shall take effect on the date of such expiration.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 16, 2016.
