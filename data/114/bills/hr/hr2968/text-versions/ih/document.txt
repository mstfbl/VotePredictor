    Section 403 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 603) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Coordinated Case Management Demonstration Projects.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make grants to 
        States to conduct demonstration projects designed to implement 
        and evaluate strategies to provide coordinated case management 
        to help individuals receiving assistance under a State program 
        funded under this part or any other State program funded with 
        qualified State expenditures (as defined in section 
        409(a)(7)(B)(i)) increase their employment and self-

                this paragraph, the State will develop an individual 
                responsibility plan in accordance with section 408(b) 
                for each recipient referred to in paragraph (1) of this 
                subsection.
                    ``(B) Describe how the State will coordinate the 
                development of this plan with other programs and 
                agencies providing benefits and services to the 
                individual to help the recipient increase the 
                employment and self-sufficiency of the recipient.
                    ``(C) Describe how the State will coordinate the 
                delivery of the benefits and services to the recipient 
                (which may include the use of home visiting models).
                    ``(D) Describe how the State will meet with the 
                recipient at least monthly to review the employment 
                status of the recipient and status of the participation 
                of the recipient in other activities, the benefits and 
                services the recipient is receiving, and the progress 
                of the recipient toward meeting the goals specified in 
                the individual responsibility plan of the recipient.
            ``(3) Use of funds.--A State to which a grant is made under 
        this subsection may use the grant for the following purposes:
                    ``(A) To support coordinated case managers in 
                completing the activities specified in paragraph (2).
                    ``(B) To provide short-term transitional benefits 
                and services to individuals who, due to increased 
                employment or earnings, may face disincentives to 
                increasing work or earnings due to the phase-out or 
                loss of certain benefits.
                    ``(C) To ensure that recipients of services under 
                the demonstration project have a choice between 2 or 
                more coordinated case management service providers.
                    ``(D) To improve coordination between programs 
                serving recipients who are part of the demonstration 
                project.
                    ``(E) To improve coordination between information 
                technology and other systems to deliver better benefits 
                or services to the recipient, except that not more than 
                10 percent of the grant amount may be used for this 
                purpose.
            ``(4) Evaluation.--The Secretary, in consultation with each 
        State conducting a demonstration project under this subsection, 
        shall conduct a high-quality evaluation of the demonstration 
        project in accordance with the following:
                    ``(A) Evaluator qualifications.--The Secretary may 
                not enter into a contract with an evaluator unless the 
                evaluator has demonstrated experience in conducting 
                rigorous evaluations of program effectiveness 
                including, where available and appropriate, well-
                implemented randomized controlled trials.
                    ``(B) Methodologies to be used.--The evaluation of 
                a demonstration project shall use experimental designs 
                using random assignment or other reliable, evidence-
                based research methodologies that allow for the 
                strongest possible causal inferences when random 
                assignment is not feasible.
                    ``(C) Public disclosure.--The Secretary shall 
                publish the results of the evaluation on the website of 
                the Department of Health and Human Services in a 
                location easily accessible by the public.
                    ``(D) Limitation on cost of evaluations.--For 
                evaluations under this paragraph, the Secretary may not 
                obligate more than 20 percent of the funds reserved 
                under paragraph (6) for each fiscal year.
            ``(5) Recommendations to congress.--The Secretary shall 
        submit recommendations to the Congress on ways to improve case 
        management and better coordinate benefits and services across 
        programs.
            ``(6) Funding.--Of the amounts made available to carry out 
        subsection (b) for fiscal year 2016 and each succeeding fiscal 
        year, the Secretary shall reserve $300,000,000 to carry out 
        this subsection.
            ``(7) Availability of funds.--Funds provided to a State 
        under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be expended by 
        the State in the fiscal year or in the succeeding fiscal 
        year.''.
