                                 A BILL


 
To establish in the United States Agency for International Development 
an entity to be known as the United States Global Development Lab, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Development Lab Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Leveraging academic research and private sector 
        expertise to effectively apply science and technology to United 
        States foreign aid can increase the effectiveness of United 
        States aid dollars and lead to better outcomes.
            (2) In the last 20 years, human ingenuity and 
        entrepreneurship around the world has reduced child mortality 
        rates by 42 percent and poverty rates by 52 percent, lifting 
        hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
            (3) Over the next 40 years, the developing world is 
        expected to be the largest source of product and services 
        growth. Breakthroughs pioneered for the developing world can 
        translate into jobs and economic growth in the United States.
            (4) In 2014 the Office of Science and Technology and the 
        Office of Innovation and Development Alliances at the United 
        States Agency for International Development were abolished to 
        pave the way to bring their staffing and other resources into 
        the United States Global Development Lab.
            (5) The Lab represents a new approach to invest, test, and 
        apply more effective solutions to humanity's greatest 
        challenges.
            (6) The Lab will partner with entrepreneurs, experts, 
        nongovernmental organizations, universities, and science and 
        research institutions to solve development challenges in a 
        faster, more cost-efficient, and more sustainable way.
            (7) The Lab will utilize innovation incentives, a pay-for-
        success model, which uses science, technology, and innovation-
        driven competitions to expand the number and diversity of 
        solutions to development challenges.
            (8) In contrast with traditional grants or contracts, where 
        USAID pays for a proposal to be implemented, pay-for-success 
        awards are given to a winner only after the objectives of the 
        competition have been achieved.
            (9) Expanding pay-for-success authority to allow the Lab to 
        use these awards globally will increase the number of high 
        value solutions to choose from at a significantly reduced cost.
