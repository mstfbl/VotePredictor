in significant and increasing credit risk-transfer transactions.
    ``(b) Considerations.--In establishing the guidelines under 
subsection (a), the Director shall--
            ``(1) seek to promote a deep, broad market for a variety of 
        structures that together insulate the taxpayer from losses, 
        minimize ongoing risks to the enterprises, remain stable 
        through the economic cycle, maintain adequate access to the 
        secondary market for lenders of all sizes, and promote credit 
        for borrowers in all communities;
            ``(2) continue and seek to increase the amount and types of 
        risk-transfer transactions that the enterprises engaged in 
        during the previous year with the goal that the risk 
        transferred by an enterprise by all credit risk-transfer 
        transactions shall be at least 400 basis points of risk in 
        total, starting from the first dollar of credit loss among all 
        the different credit risk-transfer structures;
            ``(3) continue and seek to increase front-end risk transfer 
        transactions; and
            ``(4) continue and seek to increase transactions in which 
        the first loss position is transferred or shared and through 
        structures that are scalable and transparent.
    ``(c) Guarantee Fees.--The enterprises shall set and publish 
guarantee fees, including up-front delivery fees and loan level price 
adjustments, commensurate with the enterprises' reduced credit risk 
resulting from any new risk-transfer transaction.
    ``(d) APA Compliance.--The guidelines required under subsection (a) 
shall be issued and made available to the public pursuant to section 
553 of title 5, United States Code.
    ``(e) Compensation.--The Director shall adjust individual and 
corporate scorecards used in determining compensation for relevant 
enterprise employees to align with the considerations of subsection 
(b).
    ``(f) Exemption From Commodity Exchange Act; Consultation.--
            ``(1) Exemption.--A swap (as such term is defined in 
        section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a)) entered 
        into for the purpose of transferring or sharing credit risk in 
        connection with a risk-transfer transaction shall not be deemed 
        to be a commodity interest (as such term is defined in section 
        1.3(yy) of the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading 
        Commission (17 C.F.R. 1.3(yy))), and no swap counterparty or

        transaction shall be deemed to be a commodity pool operator (as 
        such term is defined in section 1.3(cc) of such regulations), 
        solely by virtue of entering into or sponsoring or arranging 
        such a swap in connection with such transaction.
            ``(2) Prior consultation requirement.--Before the execution 
        of a risk-transfer transaction that would be exempt from the 
        Commodity Exchange Act pursuant to paragraph (1), the Director 
        shall consult with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
    ``(g) Report.--The Director shall submit a report, not later than 
October 30 of each year, to the Committee on Financial Services of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and

        premiums applicable to qualifying loans purchased by the
