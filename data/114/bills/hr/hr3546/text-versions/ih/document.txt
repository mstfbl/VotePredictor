                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to clarify provisions enacted 
  by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, to further the conservation of 
           certain wildlife species, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Big Cat Public Safety Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The global illicit trade in wildlife may be worth up to 
        $20,000,000,000 annually and the value of legal wildlife trade 
        in the United States was recently estimated at $2,800,000,000 
        annually.
            (2) The illegal trade in prohibited wildlife species (as 
        defined in section 2(g) of the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 
        U.S.C. 3371(g)) stimulates demand and expands markets in which 
        those species can be illegally sold.
            (3) The private possession, breeding, and sale of 
        prohibited wildlife species has a substantial and detrimental 
        effect on the health and general welfare of the people of the 
        United States and on the conservation of the species 
        themselves.
            (4) Private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife 
        species have a substantial and direct effect on interstate 
        commerce because prohibited wildlife species are frequently 
        bred and possessed to be used in public exhibition or for sale 
        or transfer of ownership in the exotic pet trade, and are often 
        transported in interstate commerce for these purposes.
            (5) Private possession and breeding of prohibited wildlife 
        species contributes to the interstate traffic in those species 
        and may contribute to illegal international wildlife trade.
            (6) Prohibited wildlife species in private possession, or 
        distributed intrastate, are fungible commodities that cannot be 
        differentiated, in terms of control, from prohibited wildlife 
        species possessed or distributed interstate.
            (7) It is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between 
        prohibited wildlife species that are possessed, bred, sold, or 
        transported in interstate commerce from those that have not 
        been.
            (8) Federal control of the intrastate private possession 
        and breeding of prohibited wildlife species is essential to the 
        effective control of the interstate incidents of traffic in 
        prohibited wildlife species.
            (9) The United States is a party to the Convention on 
        International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
        Flora, which was designed to protect species of wild fauna and 
        flora against overexploitation through international trade.
