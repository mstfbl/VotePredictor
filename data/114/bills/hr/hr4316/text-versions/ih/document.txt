                                 A BILL


 
To provide for the hiring of 200 additional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
 Firearms and Explosives agents and investigators to enforce gun laws.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) On average, more than 100,000 people in the United 
        States are shot in murders, assaults, and other crimes and more 
        than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including 
        2,677 children under 18 years of age.
            (2) Many of these crimes were committed by people who never 
        should have been able to purchase a gun.
            (3) Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose 
        their lives to gun violence, having been shot to death while 
        protecting their communities.
            (4) Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions 
        asked'' transactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of 
        guns now sold in the United States are sold without a 
        background check of the purchaser.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES 
              AGENTS AND INVESTIGATORS.

    The Attorney General may hire 200 individuals to serve as agents 
and investigators for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives, in addition to any individuals so serving as of the date of 
the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
