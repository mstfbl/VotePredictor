                    (A) In general.--The Comptroller General of the 
                United States shall conduct a study on the impact that 
                the covered proposed rule would have, if adopted as 
                proposed, on--
                            (i) the ability of the Federal Home Loan 
                        Banks to fulfill the mandate to provide 
                        liquidity to support housing finance and 
                        economic and community development;

                        intermediaries;
                            (iv) the stability of the Federal Home Loan 
                        Bank System;
                            (v) the benefits of a diverse membership 
                        base for Federal Home Loan Banks; and
                            (vi) the ability of member institutions to 
                        rely on access to Federal Home Loan Bank 
                        advances.
                    (B) Considerations.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United 
                States shall consider--
                            (i) the comment letters submitted in 
                        response to the notice of proposed rulemaking 
                        for the covered proposed rule;

                        history of the Federal Home Loan Bank 
                        membership rules;
                            (iii) the burden placed on community 
                        financial institutions and community 
                        development financial institutions; and
                            (iv) the legal authority of the Federal 
                        Housing Finance Agency to exclude from 
                        membership any class or category of insurance 
                        companies.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
        States shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and
