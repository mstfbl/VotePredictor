                conduct that negatively affects public safety, issue a 
                subpoena to, and take the deposition of, any employee 
                of a recipient or a State safety oversight agency, if--
                            ``(i) before the issuance of the subpoena, 
                        the Secretary requests a determination by the 
                        Attorney General of the United States as to 
                        whether the subpoena will interfere with an 
                        ongoing criminal investigation; and
                            ``(ii) the Attorney General--

                                will not interfere with an ongoing 
                                criminal investigation; or

                                determination under clause (i) before 
                                the date that is 30 days after the date 
                                on which the Secretary makes a request

                manner, enter and inspect equipment, facilities, 
                rolling stock, operations, and relevant records of the 
                public transportation system of a recipient; and

            ``(2) Additional authority.--
                    ``(A) If the Secretary finds that a State safety 
                oversight agency that oversees a rail fixed guideway 
                system operating in more than 2 States has become 
                incapable of providing adequate safety oversight of 
                such system, the Secretary may administer State safety 
                oversight activities for such rail fixed guideway 
                system until the States develop a State safety 
                oversight program certified by the Secretary in 
                accordance with subsection (e) of this section.
                    ``(B) To carry out administrative and oversight 
                activities authorized by this paragraph, the Secretary 
                may use--
                            ``(i) grant funds apportioned to an 
                        eligible State under subsection (e)(6) to 
                        develop or carry out a State safety oversight 
                        program; and
                            ``(ii) grant funds apportioned to an 
                        eligible State under subsection (e)(6) that 
                        have not been obligated within the 
                        administrative period of availability.''.
