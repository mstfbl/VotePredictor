SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On October 1, 2012, the National Telecommunications and 
        Information Administration of the Department of Commerce 
        entered into a contract with the non-profit Internet 
        Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to administer the 
        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions.
            (2) On March 14, 2014, the National Telecommunications and 
        Information Administration announced its intention to 
        transition key Internet domain name functions to the Internet 
        Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the global 
        multistakeholder community.
            (3) Clause 2 of section 3 of article IV of the Constitution 
        states that ``[t]he Congress shall have Power to dispose of . . 
        . Property belonging to the United States''.
            (4) In a report issued in 2000, the Government 
        Accountability Office stated that ``it is unclear if the 
        Department [of Commerce] has the requisite authority'' to 
        transfer control of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority 
        functions to a private entity.
