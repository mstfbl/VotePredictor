    (a) In General.--Section 5000A(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue

                            ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not 
                        include any individual for any month if such 
                        individual has in effect an exemption under 
                        section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection 
                        and Affordable Care Act which certifies that--
                                    ``(I) such individual is a member 
                                of a recognized religious sect or 
                                division thereof which is described in 
                                section 1402(g)(1), and is adherent of 
                                established tenets or teachings of such 
                                sect or division as described in such 
                                section, or
                                    ``(II) such individual is a member 
                                of a religious sect or division thereof 
                                which is not described in section 
                                1402(g)(1), who relies solely on a 
                                religious method of healing, and for 
                                whom the acceptance of medical health 
                                services would be inconsistent with the 
                                religious beliefs of the individual.
                            ``(ii) Special rules.--

                                implementing section 1311(d)(4)(H) of 
                                the Patient Protection and Affordable 
                                Care Act.
                                    ``(II) Attestation required.--
                                Clause (i)(II) shall apply to an 
                                individual for months in a taxable year 
                                only if the information provided by the 
                                individual under section 1411(b)(5)(A) 
                                of such Act includes an attestation 
                                that the individual has not received 
                                medical health services during the 
                                preceding taxable year.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013.
