                        and Affordable Care Act which certifies that--
                                    ``(I) such individual is a member 
                                of a recognized religious sect or

                                whom the acceptance of medical health 
                                services would be inconsistent with the 
                                religious beliefs of the individual.
                            ``(ii) Special rules.--
