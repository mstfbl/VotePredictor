SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Coral reefs are an important natural resource that 
        provide ecosystem goods and services, including high levels of 
        biodiversity, the provision of seafood and medicinal compounds, 
        coastal surge protection and shoreline stabilization, 
        recreational opportunities, and the retention of cultural and 
        traditional lifestyles and practices, all of which are of 
        enormous economic and environmental benefits to the United 
        States.
            (2) Coral reef conservation and restoration are in the 
        national interest of the United States and its citizens.
            (3) Scientific research suggests that the health and 
        functioning of coral reef ecosystems may be reduced by direct 
        human impacts, deteriorating water quality, changing ocean 
        conditions including warming seas and ocean acidification, 
        invasive species, coral bleaching, and coral diseases.
            (4) Due to the complex nature of coral reef ecosystems, 
        more research is needed to understand their structure and 
        function, and their response to natural and human disturbance.
            (5) Basic and applied research conducted by academic and 
        nonprofit research institutions, Federal agencies, and State, 
        local, and territorial agencies is indispensable to 
        understanding, conserving, and restoring coral reefs and coral 
        reef ecosystems.
            (6) Coral reef restoration is essential for the effective 
        conservation and recovery of coral reef ecosystems, and 
        innovative tools, technologies, and strategies to aid these 
        efforts are desperately needed.
            (7) Artificial reefs are not an adequate replacement for 
        lost or degraded coral reefs but may provide benefits to coral 
        reef ecosystems and local communities in certain contexts.
            (8) Extensive public involvement and consensus-based 
        cooperation and consultation between Federal agencies, State, 
        local, and territorial agencies, academic and nonprofit 
        research institutions, coral reef-dependent businesses, and 
        coral reef-focused nongovernmental organizations, are essential 
        to furthering the conservation and restoration of coral reef 
        and coral reef ecosystems and ensure balanced economic and 
        environmental benefits for the American people.
            (9) The development and implementation of Marine Reserve 
        fishing closures for the purpose of coral reef conservation 
        should represent a last-resort option for Federal resource 
        managers, unless they--
                    (A) are developed and implemented through extensive 
                public involvement by local citizens and consensus-
                based cooperation and consultation between Federal 
                agencies, affected State, local, and territorial 
                agencies, locally knowledgeable academic and nonprofit 
                research institutions, locally affected coral reef-
                dependent businesses, and locally operating coral reef-
                focused nongovernmental organizations;
                    (B) are based on rigorous scientific evidence; and
                    (C) feature an adaptive management approach with 
                clearly identifiable, measurable, science-based goals.
            (10) The rapid decline of coral reefs in the last four 
        decades, both in the United States and globally, is 
        unsustainable and requires urgent, renewed attention toward 
        understanding, conserving, and restoring coral reefs.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT OF CORAL REEF CONSERVATION ACT OF 2000.

    Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this Act an 
amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to or repeal
