    Chapter VI (21 U.S.C. 361 et seq.), as amended by section 3, is 
further amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 605. REGISTRATION OF COSMETIC MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--
            ``(1) Registration.--The Secretary shall by regulation 
        require that every domestic and foreign establishment engaged 
        in the manufacture of a cosmetic intended to be sold in the 
        United States that is not exempt under subsection (e) be 
        registered with the Secretary within 60 business days after the 
        first commercial sale of a cosmetic in the United States. If a 
        cosmetic is processed in more than one establishment, 
        registration shall be required under this section only for the 
        establishment that performs the final portion of the 
        manufacturing operation. The single registration shall cover 
        all such cosmetics manufactured by the establishment. The 
        registration shall state only the name of the company or other 
        organization name of the establishment, the city, street 
        address, State, and country of the establishment, and the 
        title, email address, and telephone number for the office 
        within the establishment that is responsible for submitting and 
        maintaining the registration. For a foreign establishment, the 
        registration shall include the contact information for the 
        initial United States agent of the establishment.
            ``(2) Unique number.--The Secretary shall establish and 
        provide to each registrant under this section a unique cosmetic 
        establishment registration number within 15 business days after 
        receiving the registration. If the Secretary does not provide a 
        unique cosmetic establishment registration number within such 
        15 business days, any requirement under this Act for such 
        number shall be deemed to be inapplicable until 30 business 
        days after such number is received by the person who submitted 
        the registration. Where more than one person registers the same 
        establishment, the Secretary shall provide only one unique 
        establishment registration number for the establishment. The 
        unique cosmetic establishment number shall not be required to 
        be included in cosmetic labeling.
    ``(b) Maintenance.--The information required in a registration 
under subsection (a) or in an existing registration under subsection 
(e)(1)(A) shall be maintained as current and accurate by the registrant 
by withdrawing or amending the registration within 60 business days 
after the information becomes no longer current and accurate.

section 301(ddd) and shall not suspend or revoke a registration under 
this section.
