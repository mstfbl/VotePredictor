  To direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to review all its 
   significant regulations to determine whether such regulations are 
necessary in the public interest or whether such regulations should be 
                         amended or rescinded.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlining Excessive and Costly 
Regulations Review Act''.

SEC. 2. REGULATORY REVIEW.

    (a) Review and Action.--Not later than 5 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, and at least once within each 10-year period 
thereafter, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall--
            (1) review each significant regulation issued by the 
        Commission;
            (2) determine by Commission vote whether each such 
        regulation--
                    (A) is outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or 
                excessively burdensome; or
                    (B) is no longer necessary in the public interest 
                or consistent with the Commission's mandate to protect 
                investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient 
                markets, and facilitate capital formation;
            (3) provide notice and solicit public comment as to whether 
        a regulation described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph 
        (2) (as determined by Commission vote pursuant to such 
        paragraph) should be amended to improve or modernize such 
        regulation so that such regulation is in the public interest, 
        or whether such regulation should be repealed; and
            (4) amend or repeal any regulation described in 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2), as determined by 
        Commission vote pursuant to such paragraph.
    (b) Definition.--As used in this Act and for purposes of the review 
required by subsection (a) the term ``significant regulation'' has the 
meaning given the term ``major rule'' in section 804(2) of title 5, 
United States Code.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 45 days after any final 
Commission vote described in subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall 
transmit a report to the Committee on Financial Services of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs of the Senate describing the Commission's review under 
subsection (a), its vote or votes, and the actions taken pursuant to 
paragraph (3) of such subsection. If the Commission determines that 
legislation is necessary to amend or repeal any regulation described in 
subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(2), the Commission shall 
include in the report recommendations for such legislation.
    (d) Not Subject to Judicial Review.--Any vote by the Commission 
made pursuant to subsection (a)(2) shall be final and not subject to 
judicial review.
