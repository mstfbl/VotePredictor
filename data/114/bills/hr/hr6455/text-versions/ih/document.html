    To require a certain percentage of LNG and crude oil exports be 
transported on vessels documented under the laws of the United States, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energizing American Maritime Act''.

SEC. 2. NATIONAL POLICY ON STRATEGIC ENERGY ASSET EXPORT 
              TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) LNG Exports.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) LNG is an explosive gas that can be hazardous 
                to national import and export terminals and ports when 
                mishandled.
                    (B) LNG is a strategic national asset, the export 
                of which will be used to preserve the United States 
                tanker fleet and skilled mariner workforce that are 
                essential to national security.
                    (C) For the safety and security of the United 
                States, LNG should be exported on vessels documented 
                under the laws of the United States.
            (2) Requirement.--Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (15 
        U.S.C. 717b) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(g) Transportation of Exports of LNG on Vessels Documented Under 
Laws of the United States.--As a condition for approval of any 
authorization to export LNG, the Secretary of Energy shall require the 
applicant to transport the authorized exports on vessels documented 
under the laws of the United States, as follows:
            ``(1) Fifteen percent of the LNG authorized to be exported 
        in each of 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
            ``(2) Thirty percent of the LNG authorized to be exported 
        in 2025 and each year thereafter.''.
            (3) Opportunities for licensed and unlicensed mariners.--
        Each Federal official responsible for the issuance of a permit 
        authorizing the export of LNG shall require, as a condition and 
        term of the permit, that the permittee shall provide 
        opportunities for United States licensed and unlicensed 
        mariners to receive experience and training necessary for them 
        to become credentialed in working on an LNG vessel.
    (b) Crude Oil.--Section 101 of title I of division O of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (42 U.S.C. 6212a) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``subsections (c) and 
        (d)'' and inserting ``subsections (c), (d), and (e)'';
            (2) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:
    ``(e) Transportation of Exports of Crude Oil on Vessels Documented 
Under Laws of the United States.--As a condition to export crude oil, 
the President shall require an applicant to transport the exports on 
vessels documented under the laws of the United States, as follows:
            ``(1) Fifteen percent of the crude oil to be exported in 
        each of 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
            ``(2) Thirty percent of the crude oil to be exported in 
        2025 and each year thereafter.''.
