        abortion has been performed in violation of any provision of 
        this section may, in a civil action against any person who 
        committed the violation obtain appropriate relief, unless the 
        pregnancy resulted from the plaintiff's criminal conduct.
            ``(3) Appropriate relief.--Appropriate relief in a civil 
        action under this subsection includes--
                    ``(A) objectively verifiable money damages for all

            ``(4) Attorneys fees for plaintiff.--The court shall award 
        a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs to a 
        prevailing plaintiff in a civil action under this subsection.
            ``(5) Attorneys fees for defendant.--If a defendant in a 
        civil action under this subsection prevails and the court finds 
        that the plaintiff's suit was frivolous, the court shall award 
        a reasonable attorney's fee in favor of the defendant against 
        the plaintiff.
            ``(6) Awards against woman.--Except under paragraph (5), in
