                                 A BILL


 
 To discontinue Radio Martii and Television Martii broadcasts to Cuba.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Wasting Taxpayer Money on Cuba 
Broadcasting Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) For 30 years, the United States Government has 
        broadcast news and information to Cuba with the intent to 
        promote freedom and democracy.
            (2) Since fiscal year 1984, Congress has appropriated 
        approximately $770,000,000 to the Office of Cuban Broadcasting 
        to operate Radio and TV Martii, according to the Congressional 
        Research Service.
            (3) Historical surveys conducted by the Broadcasting Board 
        of Governors indicate that Radio and TV Martii reached an 
        audience of less than 2 percent of Cuban adults in households 
        with landline phones.
            (4) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has no current, 
        valid estimates of audience size in Cuba and therefore is 
        unable to report on the cost effectiveness of its activities.
            (5) Radio and TV Martii recently were characterized by 
        media sources as a symbol of ineffectual Cold War policy and 
        government waste rather than a serious democratic tool.
            (6) On December 17, 2014, President Barack Obama announced 
        a new policy of engagement toward Cuba that ``will end an 
        outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our 
        interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations 
        between our two countries''.

SEC. 3. DISCONTINUATION OF RADIO MARTII AND TELEVISION MARTII 
              BROADCASTS TO CUBA.

    (a) Radio Broadcasting to Cuba Act.--The Radio Broadcasting to Cuba 
Act (22 U.S.C. 1465 et seq.) is repealed.
    (b) Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act.--The Television 
Broadcasting to Cuba Act (22 U.S.C. 1465aa et seq.) is repealed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
