SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, 
        sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New 
        Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her 
        home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been 
        convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.
            (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104-
        145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by 
        identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the 
        means to monitor their activities.
            (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child 
        Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to 
        protect children and the public at large by establishing a 
        comprehensive national system for the registration and 
        notification to the public and law enforcement officers of 
        convicted sex offenders.
            (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex 
        offenders are traveling internationally.
            (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child 
        sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The 
        International Labour Organization has estimated that 1,8000,000 
        children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking and 
        pornography each year.
            (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a 
        foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in 
        that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where 
        commercial, child sex trafficking.
