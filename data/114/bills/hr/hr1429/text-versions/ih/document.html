    Section 3(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(9) Petitions for reconsideration of size standards.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A person may file a petition for 
                reconsideration with the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
                (as designated in part 134 of title 13, Code of Federal 
                Regulations, that was in effect on January 1, 2016, or 
                any successor to such Office) of a size standard 
                revised, modified, or established by the Administrator 
                pursuant to this subsection.
                    ``(B) Time limit.--A person filing a petition for 
                reconsideration described in subparagraph (A) shall 
                file such petition not later than 30 days after the 
                publication in the Federal Register of the notice of 
                final rule to revise, modify, or establish size 
                standards described in paragraph (6).
                    ``(C) Process for agency review.--The Office of 
                Hearings and Appeals shall use the same process it uses 
                to decide challenges to the size of a small business 
                concern to decide a petition for review pursuant to 
                this paragraph.
                    ``(D) Judicial review.--The publication of a final 
                rule in the Federal Register described in subparagraph 
                (B) shall be considered final agency action for 
                purposes of seeking judicial review. Filing a petition 
                for reconsideration under subparagraph (A) shall not be 
                a condition precedent to judicial review of any such 
                size standard.''.
