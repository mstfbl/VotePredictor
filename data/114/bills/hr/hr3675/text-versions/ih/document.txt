                Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this 
                subsection, if the rate of interest determined under 
                subparagraph (B) with respect to any loan for which the 
                first disbursement is made on or after July 1, 2015, is 
                less than the applicable rate of interest for the loan 
                under paragraph (8), the applicable rate of interest 
                for the loan shall be the rate determined under 
                subparagraph (B).
                    ``(B) Determination of rate.--The rate of interest 
                determined under this subparagraph is, with respect to

                on July 1 and ending on June 30, the primary credit

                the rate of interest under subparagraph (B) after 
                consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and

                as practicable after the date of determination.
                    ``(D) Fixed rate.--The applicable rate of interest 
                determined under this paragraph for a loan shall be

such Act (20 U.S.C. 1087e(b)), as amended by subsection (a), is further 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(12) Borrower modification of interest rate.--
                    ``(A) Modification.--Notwithstanding the preceding 
                paragraphs of this subsection, the borrower of a

                Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, 
                or a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan may elect to 
                modify the interest rate of the loan to be equal to the 
                interest rate that would be applicable to such loan if 
                such loan were first disbursed (or in the case of a 
                Federal Direct Consolidation Loan, first applied for) 
                on the date on which such borrower elects to modify the 
                interest rate of such loan.
                    ``(B) Fixed rate.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (C), an interest rate elected under 
                subparagraph (A) for a loan shall be fixed for the life 
                of the loan.
                    ``(C) Continuing authority to modify.--A borrower 
                may elect to modify the interest rate of a loan in 
                accordance with subparagraph (A) at any time during the
