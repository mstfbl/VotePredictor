SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM ON FULLY DEVELOPED APPEALS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry out

section.
    (b) Election.--
            (1) Filing.--In accordance with paragraph (2), a claimant 
        may elect to file a fully developed appeal under the pilot 
        program under subsection (a) by filing with the Secretary the 
        following:
                    (A) The notice of disagreement under chapter 71 of 
                title 38, United States Code, along with the written 
                election of the claimant to have the appeal determined 
                under the pilot program.
                    (B) All evidence that the claimant believes is 
                needed for the appeal as of the date of the filing.
                    (C) A statement of the argument in support of the 
                claim, if any.
            (2) Timing.--A claimant shall make an election under 
        paragraph (1)--
                    (A) if the claimant has filed a traditional appeal 
                with respect to the claim for disability compensation 
                before the date on which the pilot program under 
                subsection (a) commences, at any time during the 
                traditional appeal process, notwithstanding paragraph 
                (1)(A); or
                    (B) if the claimant has not so filed a traditional 
                appeal with respect to the claim for disability 
                compensation before such date, as part of the notice of 
                disagreement filed by the claimant in accordance with 
                paragraph (1)(A).
            (3) Change of processing.--If a claimant described in 
        paragraph (2)(A) seeks to elect to make an election under 
        paragraph (1) to change a traditional appeal to a fully 
        developed appeal, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) inform the claimant of whether, in light of 
                such traditional appeal being processed, the claimant 
                will achieve any time savings through such a fully 
                developed appeal; and
                    (B) if the claimant elects to file such fully 
                developed appeal, process the fully developed appeal in 
                accordance with this section to the extent practicable.
            (4) Reversion.--At any time, a claimant who makes an 
        election under paragraph (1) may elect to revert to the 
        traditional appeals process without any penalty to the claimant 
        other than the loss of the docket number associated with the 
        fully developed appeal.
            (5) Use of fully developed appeal.--A claimant may only 
        make an election under paragraph (1) with respect to a claim 
        for disability compensation filed by the claimant that is not, 
        with respect to a claim previously decided by fully developed 
        appeal, a petition to reopen the claim or a separate claim for 
        an increased rating for the claim.
            (6) Outreach.--In providing claimants with notices of the 
        determination of a claim during the period in which the pilot 
        program under subsection (a) is carried out, the Secretary 
        shall provide to the claimant information regarding--
                    (A) the pilot program;
                    (B) how to make an election under paragraph (1);
                    (C) what documents the claimant must provide during 
                the course of the appeals process; and
                    (D) the ability of the claimant to seek advice and 
                education regarding such process from veterans service 
                organizations and attorneys recognized under chapter 59 
                of title 38, United States Code.

                    (A) The Board of Veterans' Appeals shall--
                            (i) maintain fully developed appeals on a 
                        separate docket than traditional appeals;
                            (ii) hear fully developed appeals in the

                        (B), decide not more than one fully developed

                            (iv) to the extent practicable, decide each 
                        fully developed appeal by the date that is one 
                        year following the date on which the claimant 
                        files the notice of disagreement.
                    (B) Beginning one year after the date on which the

                for each fully developed appeal under subparagraph 
                (A)(iii) if the Board determines that such adjustment 
                is fair for both traditional appeals and fully 
                developed appeals.

            (4) Prohibition on remand to regional office.--If the Board 
        of Veterans' Appeals determines that a fully developed appeal

                the receipt of such records, opinions, or exams to 
                provide the Board any additional evidence.

                decide a fully developed appeal.
                    (B) The Secretary shall--
                            (i) ensure that the Veterans Benefits 
                        Administration cooperates with the Board of 
                        Veterans' Appeals in carrying out subparagraph
