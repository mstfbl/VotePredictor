        apply to a savings and loan holding company that is an 
        insurance company, an affiliate of an insured depository 
        institution that is an insurance company, and to any other 
        company that is an insurance company and that directly or 
        indirectly controls an insured depository institution, to the 
        same extent as the provisions of that section apply to a bank 
        holding company that is an insurance company.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Requiring a bank holding 
        company that is an insurance company, a savings and loan

        or any other company that is an insurance company and that 
        directly or indirectly controls an insured depository 
        institution to serve as a source of financial strength under 
        this section shall be deemed an action of the Board that 
        requires a bank holding company to provide funds or other 
        assets to a subsidiary depository institution for purposes of 
        section 5(g) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
        1844(g)).''.
    (b) Liquidation Authority.--The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and

        insurance company, the Corporation--
                    ``(A) shall promptly notify the State insurance 
                authority for the insurance company of the intention to 
                take such lien; and

                        available to such covered financial company or 
                        covered subsidiary; and
                            ``(ii) if the Corporation determines, after 
                        consultation with the State insurance 
                        authority, that such lien will not unduly 
                        impede or delay the liquidation or 
                        rehabilitation of the insurance company, or the 
                        recovery by its policyholders''.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 16, 2015.

            Attest:
