                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the African Elephant Conservation Act and the Rhinoceros and 
Tiger Conservation Act to provide for trade sanctions against countries 
 involved in illegal trade of elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Targeted Use of Sanctions for 
Killing Elephants and Rhinoceros Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) poaching of African elephants and rhinoceros has 
        increased dramatically since 2006, and has reached levels that 
        threaten the continued existence of many elephant and 
        rhinoceros populations;
            (2) poaching of African elephants and rhinoceros is being 
        driven by increased demand for ivory and rhinoceros horn in 
        Asia, which has caused ivory and rhinoceros horn prices to rise 
        exponentially in recent years;
            (3) high prices have drawn organized criminal elements into 
        the illegal trade of ivory and rhinoceros horn, and it is 
        widely recognized that transnational crime rings involved in 
        trafficking in drugs, guns, and humans are also responsible for 
        trafficking in large quantities of poached ivory and rhinoceros 
        horn from Africa to Asia;
            (4) there is significant evidence that terrorist and 
        insurgent groups in Africa, including groups with ties to Al 
        Qaeda, are financing their operations through the sale of 
        illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn;
            (5) the elephant and rhinoceros poaching crisis has become 
        so severe, and the tactics of poachers so sophisticated, that 
        traditional approaches to conservation law enforcement intended 
        to protect elephants and rhinoceros in their habitat in Africa 
        are failing;
            (6) a number of countries that serve as major source, 
        transit, or destination points for illegal ivory and rhinoceros 
        horn have proven unable or unwilling to stop the product from 
        coming across their borders; and
            (7) strategies to reduce demand for ivory and rhinoceros 
        horn through education and other nonbinding means are 
        necessary, but not sufficient, to conserve African elephant and 
        rhinoceros populations.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a means by 
which the United States can affect demand for and illegal trafficking 
of African elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn in other countries by 
requiring those countries to enter into consultations with the United 
States to end the illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn trade, as a 
condition of continued access to United States markets for other 
natural resource products.
