                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the display of the 
            Confederate battle flag in national cemeteries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON DISPLAY OF CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG IN 
              NATIONAL CEMETERIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Confederate battle flag is a potent reminder of a 
        deeply divisive period of our Nation's history, recalling the 
        human suffering of slavery and Jim Crow.
            (2) For millions of Americans, including veterans and their 
        families, the Confederate battle flag is a symbol of 
        intolerance, injustice, and inequality.
            (3) Flying the Confederate battle flag, originally the 
        banner of forces fighting the armies of the United States, is 
        offensive and inappropriate at cemeteries and other sites 
        dedicated to the memory of America's courageous war dead.
    (b) Prohibition.--Chapter 24 of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 2415. Prohibition on display of Confederate battle flag
    ``The Secretary shall prohibit the display of the Confederate 
battle flag in any national cemetery under the control of the National 
Cemetery Administration.''.
    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
such chapter is amended by adding at the end the following new item:

``2415. Prohibition on display of Confederate battle flag.''.
                                 <all>
