SECTION 1. EXTENSION.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified in 
section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that would 
otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission project 
numbered 12737, the Commission may, at the request of the licensee for 
the project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the good 
faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements of that section 
and the Commission's procedures under that section, extend the time 
period during which the licensee is required to commence the 
construction of the project for up to three consecutive 2-year periods 
from the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by 
the Commission.
    (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period required for 
commencement of construction of the project described in subsection (a) 
has expired prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Commission may reinstate the license for the project effective as of 
the date of its expiration and the first extension authorized under 
subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of such expiration.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 14, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
