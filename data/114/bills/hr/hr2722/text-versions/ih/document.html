                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in recognition 
                  of the fight against breast cancer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer Awareness 
Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American 
        women, except for skin cancers. Today, about 1 in 8, or 12 
        percent of, women in the United States will develop invasive 
        breast cancer during their lifetime. This is an increase from 1 
        in 11, or 9 percent of, women in 1975.
            (2) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
        death in women. The chance of dying from breast cancer is about 
        1 in 36. Thanks to earlier detection, increased awareness, and 
        improved treatment, death rates from breast cancer have 
        decreased since about 1989.
            (3) There is a strong interest among the American public to 
        do more to tackle this disease. The National Cancer Institute 
        estimates $16.5 billion is spent in the United States each year 
        on breast cancer treatment. Assuming that incidence and 
        survival rates follow recent trends, it is estimated that $17.2 
        billion will be spent on breast cancer care in the United 
        States in 2014.
            (4) Finding a cure for breast cancer is a goal of the 
        United States Government.
            (5) The National Institutes of Health dedicated an 
        estimated $674 million for breast cancer research in Fiscal 
        Year 2014. In Fiscal Year 2014, the Department of Defense's 
        Breast Cancer Research Program received $120 million.
            (6) While the National Institutes of Health and the 
        Department of Defense program on Breast Cancer research remain 
        the largest funders of breast cancer research in the United 
        States, in 2013, the National Cancer Institute funding was 
        reduced by nearly $66 million since 2011. The funding level for 
        the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program has 
        remained consistent since 2012, however this amount represents 
        a 20-percent decrease from 2011 funding levels.
            (7) Additional private sector support for breast cancer 
        research will help us find cures for breast cancer even faster.
            (8) It is estimated that in the United States 231,840 women 
        will be diagnosed with and 40,290 women will die of cancer of 
        the breast in 2015. This means that every 13 minutes a woman 
        dies of breast cancer in the United States.
            (9) However, due to disease type and lack of adequate care, 
        African-American women have the highest death rates of all 
        racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44 percent 
        more likely to die of breast cancer as compared to other racial 
        and ethnic groups.
            (10) Breast cancer used to be considered a disease of aging 
        but recent trends show that more aggressive forms of the 
        disease have been increasingly diagnosed in younger women.
            (11) Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer 
        among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including African-
        American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/Pacific Islander 
        and Hispanic/Latina women.
            (12) Clinical advances, resulting from research, have led 
        to increased survival from breast cancer. Since 1990, death 
        rates from breast cancer have dropped over 34 percent.
            (13) Among men in the United States it is estimated that 
        there will be 2,350 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 440 
        breast cancer deaths in 2015.
            (14) At this time there are more than 3.1 million breast 
        cancer survivors in the United States.
            (15) It is estimated that breast cancer costs $12.5 billion 
        in lost productivity. Such productivity losses will increase 
        with projected growth rate and aging of the U.S. population if 
        cancer mortality rates stay constant in the future.
            (16) There is a better chance of survival and there are 
        more treatment options with early stage detection through 
        mammograms and clinical breast exams.
            (17) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women 
        worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million new cases of breast 
        cancer among women worldwide in 2012.
            (18) Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) is considered 
        one of the most efficient cancer research charities.
            (19) Of every dollar donated to BCRF, $0.91 goes to 
        research and awareness programs--88 cents towards research and 
        3 cents towards awareness.
            (20) Founded in 1993, the BCRF has raised more than $500 
        million to fuel discoveries in tumor biology, genetics, 
        prevention, treatment, survivorship and metastasis, making BCRF 
        one of the largest private funders of breast cancer research in 
        the world. For 2014-2015, BCRF committed $58.6 million in 
        research, including $11.6 million to the international Evelyn 
        H. Lauder Founder's Fund focused on metastasis, to support the 
        work of more than 220 researchers at leading medical 
        institutions across six continents (25 states and 14 
        countries).
            (21) Susan G. Komen (Komen) is the largest non-government 
        funder of breast cancer research, funding research that spans 
        the breast cancer continuum from basic biology to treatment to 
        survivorship.
            (22) Over the past 5 years, more than 80 cents of every 
        dollar spent by Komen has gone directly to its mission to save 
        lives and end breast cancer by empowering people, ensuring 
        quality care for all and energizing science to find the cures.
            (23) Since its inception in 1982, Komen has invested more 
        than $2.6 billion towards its mission, including more than $847 
        million in over 2400 research grants and 450 clinical trials in 
        48 states and 21 different countries. Recent funding has 
        focused on research to stem metastatic and aggressive disease, 
        find scientifically sound preventive strategies, and 
        investigate environmental links to breast cancer development.
            (24) Today, BCRF and Susan G. Komen continue their work to 
        advance research and support programs for patients and their 
        families.
