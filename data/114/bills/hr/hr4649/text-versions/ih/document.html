                            African Descent.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For over 400 years, more than 15,000,000 men, women, 
        and children were the victims of the tragic transatlantic slave 
        trade, one of the darkest chapters in human history.
            (2) Pursuant to United Nations General Assembly Resolution 
        68/237 (2013), the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 
        2015-2024 as the International Decade for People of African 
        Descent, citing the need to strengthen national, regional and 
        international cooperation in relation to the full enjoyment of 
        economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights by 
        people of African descent, and their full and equal 
        participation in all aspects of society.
            (3) As proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly, 
        the theme for the International Decade for People of African 
        Descent is ``People of African descent: Recognition, Justice 
        and Development''.
            (4) A main objective for the International Decade for 
        People of African Descent is to promote respect, protection and 
        fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by 
        people of African descent, as recognized in the Universal 
        Declaration of Human Rights.
            (5) A delineated objective for the International Decade for 
        People of African Descent is to promote a greater knowledge of 
        and respect for the diverse heritage, culture and contribution 
        of people of African descent to the development of societies.
            (6) A delineated objective for the International Decade for 
        People of African Descent is the adoption and strengthening of 
        national, regional and international legal frameworks according 
        to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
        of Racial Discrimination and to ensure their full and effective 
        implementation.
            (7) Nation states are encouraged to create and implement 
        National Action Plans that put into place offices and 
        initiatives that drive implementation of the International 
        Decade for People of African Descent.
            (8) At the national level, nation states should take 
        concrete and practical steps through the adoption and effective 
        implementation of national and international legal action 
        plans, initiatives, frameworks, policies and programs to combat 
        racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
        intolerance faced by people of African descent, taking into 
        account the particular situation of women, girls and young 
        males through--
                    (A) recognition;
                    (B) justice;
                    (C) development; and
                    (D) addressing multiple or aggravated 
                discrimination.
            (9) On the regional and international levels, entities are 
        among others called to raise awareness, disseminate the 
        International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
        Racial Discrimination, assist states in the full and effective 
        implementation of their commitments, collect statistical data, 
        incorporate human rights into development programs, and honor 
        and preserve historical memory of people of African descent.
            (10) Among others, some of the steps and measures being 
        undertaken by the United Nations General Assembly include the 
        appointment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
        Rights to act as coordinator of the International Decade for 
        People of African Descent, the establishment of a forum to 
        serve as a consultation mechanism, convening of a final 
        assessment of the International Decade for People of African 
        Descent, and a permanent memorial at the United Nations 
        headquarters to honor the memory of the victims of slavery and 
        the transatlantic slave trade.
            (11) The Secretary-General of the United Nations is also 
        required to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third 
        session on the establishment and implementation of the above 
        delineated measures.
            (12) Upon the launch of the International Decade for People 
        of African Descent in 2015, Members of the United States 
        Congress introduced House Resolution 120 and Senate Concurrent 
        Resolution 5 in support of the International Decade for People 
        of African Descent, and H.R. 1039 to establish an Office of 
        Global African Descent Affairs in the Department of State to 
        monitor implementation of the commitments of the International 
        Decade for People of African Descent around the world.

                officer, trustee, partner, director, or employee of an 
                agency, project, or person of which that member, or 
                relative of that member of, the Commission is an

        as a Commissioner or employee, knowingly accept, use or dispose

        of less than $100.
            (2) Exceptions.--This subsection shall not apply to the 
        following:
                    (A) Gifts provided on the basis of a personal 
                friendship with a Commissioner or employee, unless the 
                Commissioner or employee has reason to believe that the 
                gift was provided because of the Commissioner's 
                position and not because of the personal friendship.
                    (B) Gifts provided on the basis of a family 
                relationship.
                    (C) The acceptance of training, invitations to 
                attend or participate in conferences or such other 
                events as are related to the conduct of the duties of 
                the Commission, or food or refreshment associated with 
                such activities.

                    (E) De minimis gifts provided by a foreign leader 
                or state, not exceeding a value of $260. Gifts believed 
                by Commissioners to be in excess of $260, but which 
                would create offense or embarrassment to the United 
                States Government if refused, shall be accepted and 
                turned over to the United States Government in 
                accordance with the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act 
                of 1966 and the rules and regulations governing such 
                gifts provided to Members of Congress.
                    (F) Informational materials such as documents, 
                books, videotapes, periodicals, or other forms of 
                communications.
                    (G) Goods or services provided by any agency or 
                component of the Government of the United States, 
                including any commission established under the 
                authority of such Government.
    (e) Annual Financial Report.--In addition to providing the reports 
required under section 202, the Commission shall provide, each year no 
later than January 1, to the Committees on Foreign Affairs and 
Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and to the Committees 
on Foreign Relations and Appropriations of the Senate, a financial 
report detailing and identifying its expenditures for the preceding 
fiscal year.
