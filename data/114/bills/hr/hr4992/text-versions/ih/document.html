                                 A BILL


 
 To codify regulations relating to transfers of funds involving Iran, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Financial System 
Protection Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS, SENSE OF CONGRESS, AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On November 8, 2011, the Department of the Treasury 
        identified the Islamic Republic of Iran as a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern pursuant to section 5318A of 
        title 31, United States Code, including Iran's Central Bank, 
        private Iranian banks, branches, and subsidiaries of Iranian 
        banks operating outside of Iran as posing illicit finance risks 
        for the global financial system.
            (2) On November 6, 2008, the Department of the Treasury 
        announced that it was revoking the ``U-turn'' license for Iran, 
        stating that ``as a member of the Financial Action Task Force 
        (FATF), the United States today fulfilled its obligation to 
        strengthen measures to protect the financial sector from the 
        risks posed to the international financial system by Iran''.
            (3) On February 19, 2016, the Financial Action Task Force 
        (FATF), the global standard setting body for anti-money 
        laundering and combating the financing of terrorism which has 
        determined that Iran is a ``non-cooperating country or 
        territory'' in the fight against money laundering and terror 
        financing since 2008, stated that, ``the FATF remains 
        particularly and exceptionally concerned about Iran's failure 
        to address the risk of terrorist financing and the serious 
        threat this poses to the integrity of the international 
        financial system''.
            (4) United States and foreign businesses operating or 
        seeking to operate in Iran run significant risks, as corruption 
        in Iran is endemic, with Transparency International ranking 
        Iran 130 out of 168 countries.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the entire 
financial sector of Iran, including Iran's Central Bank, private 
Iranian banks and branches, and subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating 
outside of Iran, poses illicit finance risks for the global financial 
system due to its proliferation, support for terrorism, and other 
illicit conduct.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) deny Iran access to funds denominated in United States 
        dollars, including through any offshore United States dollar 
        clearing system for transactions involving the Government of 
        Iran or an Iranian person; and
            (2) deny Iran access to United States dollars through any 
        offshore United States dollar clearing system conducted or 
        overseen by a foreign government or a foreign financial 
        institution for transactions involving the Government of Iran 
        or an Iranian person.
