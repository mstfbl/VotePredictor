        TITLE I--EXTENSION OF AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act 
of 2015''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity 
        Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the 
        United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, 
        investment, job creation, and democratic institutions 
        throughout Africa.
            (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African 
        Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, 
        development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, and 
        stability in sub-Saharan Africa.
            (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa 
        has more than tripled since the enactment of the African Growth 
        and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct 
        investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost six-fold.
            (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage 
        and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African 
        countries, to boost trade and investment between the United 
        States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and 
        strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
            (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is 
        enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the 
        fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in 
        sub-Saharan Africa.
            (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate 
        sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, 
        stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify sources 
        of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.
            (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade 
        Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen 
        regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and 
        contribute to economic growth in the region.
            (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in 
        sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced localization 
        requirements, restrictions on investment, and customs barriers, 
        will create opportunities for workers, businesses, farmers, and 
        ranchers in the United States and sub-Saharan African 
        countries.
            (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve 
        utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and 
        strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate economic 
        growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade 
        relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.

SEC. 105. MONITORING AND REVIEW OF ELIGIBILITY UNDER GENERALIZED SYSTEM 
              OF PREFERENCES.

    (a) Continuing Compliance.--Section 506A(a)(3) of the Trade Act of 
1974 (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``If the President'' and inserting the

                    ``(B) Notification.--The President may not 
                terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
                sub-Saharan African country under subparagraph (A) 
                unless, at least 60 days before the termination of such 
                designation, the President notifies Congress and 
                notifies the country of the President's intention to 
                terminate such designation, together with the 
                considerations entering into the decision to terminate 
                such designation.''.
    (b) Withdrawal, Suspension, or Limitation of Preferential Tariff 
Treatment.--Section 506A of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2466a) is

    ``(c) Withdrawal, Suspension, or Limitation of Preferential Tariff 
Treatment.--
            ``(1) In general.--The President may withdraw, suspend, or

        article described in subsection (b)(1) of this section or 
        section 112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act with 
        respect to a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the 
        President determines that withdrawing, suspending, or limiting 
        such duty-free treatment would be more effective in promoting 
        compliance by the country with the requirements described in 
        subsection (a)(1) than terminating the designation of the 
        country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for 
        purposes of this section.
            ``(2) Notification.--The President may not withdraw, 
        suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under 
        paragraph (1) unless, at least 60 days before such withdrawal, 
        suspension, or limitation, the President notifies Congress and 
        notifies the country of the President's intention to withdraw, 
        suspend, or limit such duty-free treatment, together with the 
        considerations entering into the decision to terminate such 
        designation.''.
    (c) Review and Public Comments on Eligibility Requirements.--
Section 506A of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2466a), as so amended,

            (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following:
    ``(d) Review and Public Comments on Eligibility Requirements.--

                apply with respect to beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
                countries.
            ``(4) Out-of-cycle reviews.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The President may, at any time,

                continual progress in meeting the requirements 
                described in paragraph (1). The President shall give 
                due consideration to petitions received under paragraph 
                (3) in determining whether to initiate an out-of-cycle

                African country does not meet the requirements set 
                forth in section 104(a) of the African Growth and 
                Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3703(a)), the President 
                shall, subject to the requirements of subsections 
                (a)(3)(B) and (c)(2), terminate the designation of the 
                country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country or 
                withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-
                free treatment with respect to articles from the 
                country.
                    ``(D) Reports.--After each out-of-cycle review 
                conducted under subparagraph (A) with respect to a 
                country, the President shall submit to the Committee on 
                Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and

                African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3703(a))

                appropriate, not later than 30 days after the date of 
                the enactment of this subsection.''.

SEC. 106. PROMOTION OF THE ROLE OF WOMEN IN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
              DEVELOPMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--Section 103 of the African Growth and 
Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3702) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a 
        semicolon;
            (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting 
        ``; and''; and

        and economic development in sub-Saharan Africa.''.

Growth and Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1)(A)) is amended by

SEC. 107. BIENNIAL AGOA UTILIZATION STRATEGIES.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries should 
        develop utilization strategies on a biennial basis in order to 
        more effectively and strategically utilize benefits available 
        under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (in this section 
        referred to as ``AGOA utilization strategies'');
            (2) United States trade capacity building agencies should 
        work with, and provide appropriate resources to, such sub-
        Saharan African countries to assist in developing and 
        implementing biennial AGOA utilization strategies; and
            (3) as appropriate, and to encourage greater regional 
        integration, the United States Trade Representative should 
        consider requesting the Regional Economic Communities to 
        prepare biennial AGOA utilization strategies.
    (b) Contents.--It is further the sense of Congress that biennial 
AGOA utilization strategies should identify strategic needs and 
priorities to bolster utilization of benefits available under the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act. To that end, biennial AGOA 
utilization strategies should--
            (1) review potential exports under the African Growth and 
        Opportunity Act and identify opportunities and obstacles to

SEC. 108. DEEPENING AND EXPANDING TRADE AND INVESTMENT TIES BETWEEN 
              SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND THE UNITED STATES.

    It is the policy of the United States to continue to--
            (1) seek to deepen and expand trade and investment ties 
        between sub-Saharan Africa and the United States, including 
        through the negotiation of accession by sub-Saharan African 
        countries to the World Trade Organization and the negotiation 
        of trade and investment framework agreements, bilateral 
        investment treaties, and free trade agreements, as such 
        agreements have the potential to catalyze greater trade and 
        investment, facilitate additional investment in sub-Saharan 
        Africa, further poverty reduction efforts, and promote economic 
        growth;
            (2) seek to negotiate agreements with individual sub-
        Saharan African countries as well as with the Regional Economic 
        Communities, as appropriate;
            (3) promote full implementation of commitments made under 
        the WTO Agreement (as such term is defined in section 2(9) of 
        the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501(9)) because 
        such actions are likely to improve utilization of the African 
        Growth and Opportunity Act and promote trade and investment and 
        because regular review to ensure continued compliance helps to 
        maximize the benefits of the African Growth and Opportunity 
        Act; and
            (4) promote the negotiation of trade agreements that cover 
        substantially all trade between parties to such agreements and, 
        if other countries seek to negotiate trade agreements that do 
        not cover substantially all trade, continue to object in all 
        appropriate forums.
