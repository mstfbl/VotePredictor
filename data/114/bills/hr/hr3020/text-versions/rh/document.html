programs funded in whole or in part with Federal money, all grantees 
receiving Federal funds included in this Act, including but not limited

        disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a 
        life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from 
        the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, 
        place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
        performed.
    (b) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as 
prohibiting the expenditure by a State, locality, entity, or private 
person of State, local, or private funds (other than a State's or 
locality's contribution of Medicaid matching funds).
    (c) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as

        Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289g(b)).

        Labor concerning employment of certain veterans; and

unless the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
and the Senate are consulted 15 days in advance of such reprogramming 
or of an announcement of intent relating to such reprogramming, 
whichever occurs earlier, and are notified in writing 10 days in

    (b) None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to

    Sec. 530. (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the 
``Health Care Conscience Rights Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) As Thomas Jefferson declared to New London Methodists 
        in 1809, ``[n]o provision in our Constitution ought to be 
        dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience 
        against the enterprises of the civil authority''.
            (2) Jefferson's conviction on respect for conscience is 
        deeply embedded in the history and traditions of our Nation, 
        and codified in numerous Federal laws approved by congressional 
        majorities and Presidents of both parties, including in the 
        Public Health Service Act; the United States Leadership Against 
        HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act; the Religious Freedom 
        Restoration Act; longstanding provisions on respect for 
        conscience rights in the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
        Program and District of Columbia appropriations; and laws to 
        protect individuals from being forced to participate in Federal 
        executions or prosecutions.
            (3) Following enactment of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148, in this section 
        referred to as ``PPACA''), the Federal Government has sought to 
        impose specific requirements that infringe on the rights of 
        conscience of those who offer or purchase health coverage.
            (4) While PPACA provides an exemption for some religious 
        groups that object to participation in health insurance 
        generally, and exempts millions of Americans from most of the 
        Act's provisions, including the preventive services mandate, it 
        fails to provide statutory protection for those seeking to 
        offer and purchase health coverage who have a religious or 
        moral objection only to specific items or services.
            (5) Nurses and other health care providers have 
        increasingly been subjected to discrimination for abiding by 
        their conscience rather than providing, paying for, or 
        referring for abortion.
            (6) Conscience rights protections for health care providers 
        are an important part of civil rights protections in Federal 
        law and are indispensable to the continued viability of the 
        health care system in the United States. The increasingly 
        significant discrimination suffered by faith-based nonprofit 
        health care providers risks undermining access to high-quality 
        compassionate care for some of the most vulnerable populations 
        in our country.
    (c) Applying Longstanding Policy on Conscience Rights to the 
Affordable Care Act.--
            (1) In general.--Title I of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) is amended--
                    (A) by redesignating the second section 1563 
                (relating to conforming amendments and as redesignated 
                by section 10107(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and 
                Affordable Care Act) as section 1564;
                    (B) by redesignating the third section 1563 
                (relating to the Sense of the Senate promoting fiscal 
                responsibility) as section 1565; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 1566. RESPECTING CONSCIENCE RIGHTS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
title, no provision of this title (and no amendment made by any such 
provision) shall--

        insurance coverage that includes coverage of an abortion or 
        other item or service to which such individual has a moral or 
        religious objection, or prevent an issuer from offering or 
        issuing, to such individual, individual health insurance 
        coverage that excludes such item or service;
            ``(2) require a sponsor (or, in the case of health 
        insurance coverage offered to students through an institution 
        of higher education, the institution of higher education 
        offering such coverage) to sponsor, purchase, or provide any 
        health benefits coverage or group health plan that includes 
        coverage of an abortion or other item or service to which such 
        sponsor or institution, respectively, has a moral or religious 
        objection, or prevent an issuer from offering or issuing to 
        such sponsor or institution, respectively, health insurance 
        coverage that excludes such item or service;
            ``(3) require an issuer of health insurance coverage or the 
        sponsor of a group health plan to include, in any such coverage 
        or plan, coverage of an abortion or other item or service to 
        which such issuer or sponsor has a moral or religious 
        objection; or
            ``(4) authorize the imposition of a tax, penalty, fee, 
        fine, or other sanction, or the imposition of coverage of the

        objection, in relation to health insurance coverage or a group 
        health plan that excludes an item or service pursuant to this 
        section.
    ``(b) Restriction on Contrary Governmental Action.--No provision in 
this title (or amendment made by such provision) or law, regulation, 
guideline or other governmental action that implements such provision 
or amendment, or derives its authority therefrom, shall be given legal 
effect to the extent that it violates this section.

        or derives its authority therefrom.
    ``(d) Aggregate Actuarial Value.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to prohibit the Secretary from issuing regulations or other 
guidance to ensure that health insurance coverage or group health plans 
excluding abortion or other items or services under this section shall 
have an aggregate actuarial value at least equivalent to that of health 
insurance coverage or group health plans at the same level of coverage 
that do not exclude such items or services.
    ``(e) Continued Application of Nondiscrimination Rules.--Nothing in 
this section shall be construed to permit a health insurance issuer, 
group health plan, or other health care provider to act in a manner 
inconsistent with subparagraph (B) or (D) of section 1302(b)(4).''.
