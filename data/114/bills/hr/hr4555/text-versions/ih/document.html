                                 A BILL


 
To clarify the application of section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as 
 it relates to articles from areas of the West Bank and Gaza that are 
                      not administered by Israel.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Non-Discrimination of Israel in 
Labeling Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Prior to the issuance of Trade Directive (T.D.) 95-25 
        and T.D. 97-16, the Customs Service had taken the position 
        that, in order for the country of origin marking of a good 
        which was produced in the West Bank or Gaza Strip to be 
        considered acceptable, the word ``Israel'' must appear in the 
        marking designation.
            (2) The Department of State advised the Department of 
        Treasury that, in view of certain developments, principally the 
        Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-
        Government Arrangements (signed on September 13, 1993), also 
        known as the Oslo Accords, the primary purpose of section 304 
        of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1304) would be best served 
        if goods produced in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under the 
        Palestinian interim self-government were permitted to be marked 
        ``West Bank'' or ``Gaza Strip''.
            (3) The Oslo Accords created a new self-rule entity, an 
        interim self-governing Palestinian council, granting it the 
        authority to independently conduct its affairs, including 
        financial matters such as import and export.
            (4) On March 17, 1995, President Clinton signed 
        Presidential Proclamation 6788 designating the West Bank and 
        Gaza Strip as a beneficiary of the generalized system of 
        preferences program.
            (5) The United States Customs Border Protection Cargo 
        Systems Messaging Service guidance dated March 28, 1995, 
        stated: ``The extension of the generalized system of 
        preferences program to the West Bank and Gaza Strip pursuant to 
        this Presidential Proclamation applies only to goods produced 
        in the areas for which arrangements are being established for 
        Palestinian interim self-government, as set forth in Articles 
        I, III, and IV of the Declaration of Principles on Interim 
        Self-Government arrangements.''.
            (6) The March 28, 1995, guidance further articulated 
        Articles IV and V of the Declaration of Principles on Interim 
        Self-Government arrangements, stating: ``It is understood that: 
        Jurisdiction of the Council will cover West Bank and Gaza Strip 
        territory, except for issues that will be negotiated in the 
        permanent status negotiations: Jerusalem, settlements, military 
        location, and Israelis.''.
            (7) It is the longstanding policy of the United States to 
        oppose any effort to delegitimize Israel.
            (8) The first free trade agreement by the United States was 
        between the United States and Israel, effective September 1, 
        1985.
            (9) The United States-Israel Strategic Partnership is a 
        vital asset to United States national, economic, and security 
        interests and any boycott, or sanctions effort, or policy that 
        serves to delegitimize or discriminate against Israel will 
        ultimately harm United States economic interests.
