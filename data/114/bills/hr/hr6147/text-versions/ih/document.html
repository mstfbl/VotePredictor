                                 A BILL


 
          To establish the 50th Anniversary Apollo I Memorial.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Apollo I Memorial Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On January 27, 1967, NASA Astronauts Command Pilot 
        Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, Senior Pilot Edward H. White II, and 
        Pilot Roger B. Chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that 
        broke out inside the Apollo I Command Module on Launch Pad 34 
        at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
            (2) Command Pilot Virgil Grissom was selected by NASA in 
        1959 as one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. He 
        piloted the Liberty Bell 7 spacecraft on July 21, 1963, on the 
        second and final Mercury suborbital test flight, served as 
        command pilot on the first manned Gemini flight on March 23, 
        1965, and was named as Command Pilot of the first Apollo 
        flight. He began his career in the United States Army Air Corps 
        and was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force at 
        the time of the accident, and he is buried at Arlington 
        National Cemetery.
            (3) Senior Pilot Edward H. White II was selected by NASA as 
        a member of the second astronaut team in 1962. He piloted the 
        Gemini-4 mission, a 4-day mission that took place in June 1965, 
        during which he conducted the first extravehicular activity in 
        the United States human spaceflight program. He was named as 
        Command Module Pilot for the first Apollo flight. He began his 
        career as a cadet in United States Military Academy at West 
        Point and was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air 
        Force at the time of the accident.
            (4) Pilot Roger B. Chaffee was selected by NASA as part of 
        the third group of astronauts in 1963. He was named as the 
        Lunar Module Pilot for the first Apollo flight. He began his 
        career as a ROTC cadet before commissioning as an ensign in the 
        United States Navy, he was a Lieutenant Commander in the United 
        States Navy at the time of the accident, and he is buried at 
        Arlington National Cemetery.
            (5) All 3 astronauts were posthumously awarded the 
        Congressional Space Medal of Honor.
            (6) As Arlington National Cemetery is where we recognize 
        heroes who have passed in the service of our Nation, it is 
        fitting on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo I accident that 
        we acknowledge those astronauts by building a memorial in their 
        honor.
