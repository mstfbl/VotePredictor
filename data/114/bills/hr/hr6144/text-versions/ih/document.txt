                     TITLE II--ZERO-BASED BUDGETING

SEC. 201. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Congress has the authority and responsibility under the 
        Constitution of the United States over financial and budgetary 
        matters, including the power to appropriate funds;
            (2) it is recognized that the incremental budgeting does 
        not lend itself to cost control nor accountability in spending;
            (3) a zero-based budget would offer tangible savings 
        achieved through more thorough planning and more efficient 
        allocation of resources; and
            (4) zero-based budgeting would establish a budget based 
        upon current needs rather than previous expenditures.
    (b) Sense of the House of Representatives.--It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that Congress should establish a plan to apply 
zero-based budgeting to the Federal budgetary process.

SEC. 202. ZERO-BASED BUDGETING.

    Section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i)(1) The President shall submit with materials related to the 
budget transmitted under subsection (a) on or after January 1, 2017, 
and not less than once every 4 years thereafter, a budget for each 
department and agency that contains the following information:
            ``(A) A description of each activity for which the 
        department or agency receives an appropriation in the current 
        fiscal year or for which the department or agency requests an 
        appropriation for the fiscal year for which the budget is 
        submitted.
            ``(B) The legal basis for each activity described in 
        subparagraph (A).
            ``(C) For each activity described in subparagraph (A)--
                    ``(i) three alternative funding levels for the 
                fiscal year in which the budget is submitted;
                    ``(ii) a summary of the priorities that would be 
                accomplished within each level; and
                    ``(iii) the additional increments of value that 
                would be added by the higher funding levels, not fewer 
                than two of which shall be not greater than the funding 
                level for the current fiscal year.
            ``(D) For each activity, one or more measures of cost 
        efficiency and effectiveness of the activity.
    ``(2) As soon as practicable, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget shall publish guidelines to carry out this 
subsection, including guidelines that require that--
            ``(A) the baseline budget of each department or agency is 
        assumed to be zero; and
            ``(B) each proposed expenditure shall be justified as if 
        the proposed expenditure is a new expenditure.''.

              FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NOT REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY
