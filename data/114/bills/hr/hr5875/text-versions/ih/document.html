 To establish requirements for committees of the Senate and the Senate 
     to consider and hold votes on nominations of individuals for 
         appointments by the President, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REQUIREMENTS FOR SENATE CONSIDERATION AND VOTE ON 
              NOMINATIONS SUBMITTED BY THE PRESIDENT.

    (a) Requirements for Committees.--If the President submits to the 
Senate the nomination of an individual for appointment to an office, 
the following shall apply:
            (1) If the nomination is referred to a single committee of 
        the Senate, the committee to which the nomination has been 
        referred shall hold a vote on the nomination not later than 90 
        days after the President submits the nomination, or shall 
        discharge the nomination without recommendation.
            (2) If, upon the submission of the nomination, the 
        nomination is referred jointly to more than one committee of 
        the Senate, each committee to which the nomination has been 
        referred shall hold a vote on the nomination not later than 90 
        days after the President submits the nomination, or shall 
        discharge the nomination without recommendation.
            (3) If, after the nomination is referred initially to a 
        single committee of the Senate, the nomination is referred 
        sequentially by unanimous consent to another committee of the 
        Senate--
                    (A) the committee to which the nomination was 
                initially referred shall hold a vote on the nomination 
                not later than 60 days after the President submits the 
                nomination, or shall discharge the nomination without 
                recommendation; and
                    (B) if the committee to which the nomination was 
                initially referred reports the nomination favorably to 
                the Senate, each committee to which the nomination has 
                been referred sequentially shall hold a vote on the 
                nomination not later than 20 days after the first 
                committee reports the nomination favorably, or shall 
                discharge the nomination without recommendation.
    (b) Vote by Full Senate.--
            (1) Vote upon favorable report by committee.--If each 
        committee of the Senate to which the nomination of an 
        individual has been referred reports the nomination favorably 
        to the Senate or discharges the nomination without 
        recommendation, the Senate shall hold a vote on the nomination 
        not later than 60 days after the last such committee reports or 
        discharges the nomination.
            (2) Vote on nominations not referred to committees.--If the 
        President submits to the Senate the nomination of an individual 
        for appointment to an office and the nomination is not referred 
        to any committee of the Senate, the Senate shall hold a vote on 
        the nomination not later than 150 days after the President 
        submits the nomination.
            (3) Treatment of votes on cloture in case of nominations to 
        supreme court.--In the case of the nomination of an individual 
        for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States, a 
        vote in the Senate on a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to 
        proceed to the consideration of the nomination shall be treated 
        as a vote on the nomination for purposes of this subsection.

SEC. 2. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This Act shall apply with respect to nominations submitted on or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
