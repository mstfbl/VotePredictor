                                 A BILL


 
   To reduce the operation and maintenance costs associated with the 
 Federal fleet by encouraging the use of remanufactured parts, and for 
                            other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that, in March 2013, the Government Accountability 
Office issued a report that confirmed that--
            (1) there are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the 
        civilian Federal fleet;
            (2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975,000,000 on 
        repair and maintenance of the Federal fleet in 2011;
            (3) remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, 
        starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be 
        less expensive than comparable new replacement parts; and
            (4) the United States Postal Service and the Department of 
        the Interior both informed the Government Accountability Office 
        that the respective agencies rely on the use of remanufactured 
        vehicle components to reduce costs.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``Federal agency'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 102 of title 40, United States Code; and
            (2) the term ``remanufactured vehicle component'' means a 
        vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, 
        alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension 
        component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, 
        condition and performance by a standardized industrial process 
        that incorporates technical specifications (including 
        engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully-
        warranted products.

SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS.

    The head of each Federal agency--
            (1) shall encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle 
        components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such 
        components reduces the cost of maintaining the Federal vehicles 
        while maintaining quality; and
            (2) shall not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle 
        components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such 
        components--
                    (A) does not reduce the cost of maintaining Federal 
                vehicles;
                    (B) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as 
                determined by the employee of the Federal agency 
                responsible for the repair decision; or
                    (C) delays the return to service of a vehicle.
                                                 Union Calendar No. 202
