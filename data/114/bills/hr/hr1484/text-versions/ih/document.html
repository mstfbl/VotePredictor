    To direct the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the 
  Interior to convey certain Federal lands to the State of Nevada in 
    fulfillment of the Nevada Statehood Enabling Act, and for other 
                               purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Honor the Nevada Enabling Act of 
1864 Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government controls over 80 percent of all 
        of the land within the State of Nevada, which is a greater 
        percentage than any other State.
            (2) The paucity of State land and privately controlled land 
        in Nevada severely constrains the size and diversity of 
        Nevada's economy.
            (3) The Federal Government promised all new States, in 
        their statehood enabling Act contracts, that it would dispose 
        of federally controlled public lands within the borders of 
        those States.
            (4) The Federal Government has honored this promise with 38 
        States.
            (5) The Federal Government has failed to honor this promise 
        with, and continues to control significant percentages of the 
        land within, the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, 
        Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and 
        Washington.
            (6) The United States Supreme Court has declared that 
        statehood enabling Act contracts are ``solemn compacts'' with 
        enforceable rights and obligations.
            (7) Nevada could generate significant net revenue for the 
        benefit of its lands and people if it were afforded the 
        opportunity to manage an expanded State-controlled land 
        portfolio.
            (8) A transfer of federally administered land to Nevada can 
        be accomplished in phases.
