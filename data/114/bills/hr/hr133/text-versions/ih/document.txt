 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for waivers of

    (a) In General.--Section 6033(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(4) Waiver of user fee on reinstatement applications for 
        certain tax-exempt subsidiaries.--If, upon application for 
        reinstatement of status as an organization exempt from tax 
        under section 501(a), an organization described in paragraph 
        (1) can show that--
                    ``(A) the organization has, after the failure 
                described in paragraph (1), filed any return or notice 
                with respect to which such failure to file triggered 
                the automatic revocation referred to in paragraph (1), 
                and
                    ``(B) the organization--
                            ``(i) is a subsidiary of an entity that is 
                        exempt from tax under section 501(a), and
                            ``(ii) that subsidiary, for each of the 3 
                        consecutive years referred to in paragraph (1) 
                        relating to such failure, has fewer than 50 
                        members (as reported to such entity),
        the organization's exempt status shall be reinstated effective 
        from the date of the revocation under such paragraph and the 
        Secretary shall waive any user fee imposed with respect to such 
        application.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to applications for reinstatement filed after the 
date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
