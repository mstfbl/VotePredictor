    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF FACILITY MERGER AUTHORIZATION.

    Section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.

thereof'' and inserting ``such facilities, or any part thereof, of a 
value in excess of $10,000,000''.

SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.

    Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b(a)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(7)(A) Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall promulgate a 
        rule requiring any public utility that is seeking to merge or 
        consolidate, directly or indirectly, its facilities subject to 
        the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof, with 
        those of any other person, to notify the Commission of such 
        transaction not later than 30 days after the date on which the 
        transaction is consummated if--
                    ``(i) such facilities, or any part thereof, are of 
                a value in excess of $1,000,000; and
                    ``(ii) such public utility is not required to 
                secure an order of the Commission under paragraph 
                (1)(B).
            ``(B) In establishing any notification requirement under 
        subparagraph (A), the Commission shall, to the maximum extent 
        practicable, minimize the paperwork burden resulting from the 
        collection of information.''.
