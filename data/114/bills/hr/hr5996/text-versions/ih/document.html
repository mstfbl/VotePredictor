                                 A BILL


 
  To provide United States support for the full implementation of the 
 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South 
                     Sudan, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Halt Arms and Promote Peace in South 
Sudan Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on January 9, 
        2005, provided the framework for a referendum to determine the 
        status of southern Sudan in 2011, in which approximately 99 
        percent of voters chose independence from Sudan.
            (2) Since the onset of the civil war in the Republic of 
        South Sudan, in December 2013, more than 50,000 South Sudanese 
        citizens have been killed and 1,800,000 have been internally 
        displaced, including roughly 200,000 who have sought refuge at 
        civilian protection sites established by the United Nations 
        Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS). More than 
        920,000 refugees from South Sudan have fled to neighboring 
        countries to seek asylum.
            (3) Throughout the course of the civil war, both government 
        and opposition forces have been implicated in the recruitment 
        of more than 16,000 child soldiers, and have been found 
        culpable in other egregious human rights violations, including 
        ethnically targeted rape and killing.
            (4) According to recent figures from the United Nations and 
        from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network led by the United 
        States Agency for International Development, 4,800,000 people 
        in South Sudan are experiencing crisis-level food insecurity, 
        and a quarter of a million children are facing severe 
        malnutrition. Emergency acute food insecurity is widespread in 
        parts of the Greater Upper Nile and Greater Bahr el Ghazal 
        regions of South Sudan, while some households in Northern Bahr 
        el Ghazal are on the brink of famine.
            (5) Since December 2013, 59 aid workers have been killed in 
        South Sudan. Despite the Agreement on the Resolution of the 
        Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan signed on August 17, 
        2015, which came into effect on August 26, 2015, violent 
        clashes employing tanks, helicopter gunships, and heavy 
        weaponry have continued throughout the country that routinely 
        and indiscriminately affect civilian neighborhoods and United 
        Nations compounds.
            (6) In February 2016, forces from the Sudan People's 
        Liberation Army (SPLA) attacked a civilian protection site 
        established by UNMISS in Malakal, killing up to 65 people, 
        injuring over 100, and displacing roughly 30,000. The forces 
        also burned down 3,700 shelters across one-third of the site. A 
        report by the United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry 
        later found that UNMISS failed to prepare for or mitigate the 
        attack and failed at all levels to manage the crisis 
        effectively.
            (7) In July 2016, violence initiated by SPLA forces and 
        forces from the Sudan People's Liberation Army-In-Opposition 
        (SPLA-IO) in Juba involved an attack in which SPLA forces fired 
        over 50 rounds at an armored United States embassy vehicle, an 
        attack on the Terrain compound in which SPLA soldiers sexually 
        assaulted, beat, and raped aid workers, reportedly targeting 
        Americans, and other attacks on United Nations compounds and 
        UNMISS civilan protection sites. The violence resulted in the 
        deaths of 300 people, including two United Nations peacekeepers 
        and two employees of Doctors Without Borders.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the international community should continue to support 
        civilians, particularly women and children, who have been 
        adversely affected by the civil war in South Sudan and should 
        promote peace and reconciliation dialogues within local civil 
        society;
            (2) it is imperative that African countries and 
        institutions, including the Intergovernmental Authority on 
        Development, the Peace and Security Council of the African 
        Union, and the African Union Commission, are united and firm in 
        enforcing the terms of the Agreement on the Resolution of the 
        Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (``Peace Agreement'') 
        signed on August 17, 2015, which came into effect on August 26, 
        2015;
            (3) the United Nations Security Council should hold the 
        Government of South Sudan accountable for--
                    (A) obstructing or constraining the operations of 
                the United Nations Mission in the Republic of South 
                Sudan (UNMISS), including by restricting the 
                transportation of wounded United Nations peacekeepers;
                    (B) committing other repeated violations of the 
                status of forces agreement with the United Nations 
                signed on August 8, 2011; and
                    (C) inhibiting the free movement of members of the 
                Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements 
                Monitoring Mechanism established by the Peace 
                Agreement, who are tasked with monitoring and reporting 
                violations of the Peace Agreement and verifying the 
                demilitarization of Juba;
            (4) the Government of South Sudan should--
                    (A) implement a permanent ceasefire as called for 
                in the Peace Agreement;
                    (B) comply with its obligations under the status of 
                forces agreement with the United Nations;
                    (C) bear the primary responsibility as a sovereign 
                state to protect its citizens from gross human rights 
                abuses and forced displacement perpetrated by the 
                warring parties, including the Sudan People's 
                Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Sudan People's 
                Liberation Army-In-Opposition (SPLA-IO);
                    (D) cooperate and support the work of the Joint 
                Monitoring and Evaluation Commission established by the 
                Peace Agreement;
                    (E) establish the Commission for Truth, 
                Reconciliation, and Healing, the Hybrid Court for South 
                Sudan, and the Compensation and Reparation Authority, 
                as called for in the Peace Agreement; and
                    (F) adhere to the ``Communique of the 55th Extra-
                Ordinary Session of the IGAD Council of Ministers'', 
                issued by the Intergovernmental Authority on 
                Development, which urges the parties, ``in the absence 
                of an agreement on the creation of new states, to 
                suspend further action on implementing the 
                operationalization of new states until an inclusive, 
                participatory National Boundary Commission . . . 
                reviews proposed states and their boundaries'';
            (5) any person who committed gross violations of human 
        rights, war crimes, or crimes against humanity in the course of 
        the hostilities, as documented in reports from credible 
        domestic or international bodies, should be held accountable in 
        transparent legal proceedings and should not be able to hold 
        office or positions in the Government of South Sudan or as part 
        of any power sharing agreement;
            (6) given the culpability of the SPLA and the SPLA-IO in 
        the July 2016 attacks in Juba, during which both parties used a 
        variety of weapons (including battle tanks and helicopter 
        gunships equipped with unguided rockets used by SPLA forces) in 
        densely populated areas and in close proximity to United 
        Nations compounds and civilian protection sites, the current 
        transitional security arrangements should be reevaluated and 
        revised to prioritize the demilitarization of Juba and to 
        mitigate the risk of any future harm to civilians by security 
        forces;
            (7) the failure to impose an international arms embargo on 
        South Sudan has resulted in the continued acquisition of arms 
        and military equipment by both parties and the proliferation of 
        weapons throughout the country, and in order to create 
        conditions for the successful implementation of the Peace 
        Agreement and to prevent further violence and human suffering, 
        the United States should lead the international community, 
        particularly allies such as Australia and the European Union, 
        in immediately implementing an arms embargo to prevent the 
        supply, sale, or transfer to any party to hostilities in South 
        Sudan of arms, weapons, or related material (including non-
        lethal equipment intended, or altered by a third party, for 
        military use);
            (8) pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 
        2206 (2015) and Executive Order 13664 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), 
        the United States should immediately impose targeted economic 
        sanctions, travel limitations, and asset freezes on senior 
        officials of the Government of South Sudan and officials 
        throughout the chain of command, who have--
                    (A) neglected to abide by the terms of the Peace 
                Agreement;
                    (B) violated the ceasefire;
                    (C) threatened the peace, security or stability of 
                South Sudan; or
                    (D) failed to cause forces under their direct or 
                indirect control to cease military operations, acts of 
                violence, human rights violations or abuses, or 
                violations of international humanitarian law;
            (9) given the investment of United States resources in the 
        success of South Sudan, including more than $1,700,000,000 in 
        humanitarian assistance since December 2013, it is incumbent on 
        the United States to take all necessary actions to help prevent 
        further violence and restore a lasting political and social 
        order in South Sudan; and
            (10) the United States should complement the work of the 
        United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United 
        Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
        UNMISS, and other relevant international partners, to provide 
        for the protection of civilians and assist displaced persons to 
        return home and to provide information to communities in order 
        for such displaced persons to make informed, safe, and 
        voluntary decisions regarding their return.

    (a) Export of Defense Items and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies.--
            (1) Dual-use goods.--A validated license shall be required

    (b) Implementation of Coordinated Sanctions by European Union.--The
