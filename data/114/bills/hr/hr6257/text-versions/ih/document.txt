appointment as a commissioned officer upon graduation from the Academy.

section. The regulations shall include--

period beginning on the date of the officer's appointment as a 
commissioned officer and ending on the sixth anniversary of such 
appointment or, at the discretion of the Secretary, any later date up 
to the eighth anniversary of such appointment.

cadet or former cadet to fulfill the terms of the obligation to serve 
as specified under subsection (a), or an alternative obligation imposed 
under subsection (b), shall be treated as failure to fulfill an 
eligibility requirement.''.
