                                 A BILL


 
  To modernize and improve the program for economic opportunities for 
low-income persons under section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development 
                  Act of 1968, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Section 3 Modernization and 
Improvement Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) funds administered by the Department of Housing and 
        Urban Development, particularly those intended for housing 
        construction, rehabilitation, repair, modernization, 
        management, self-sufficiency, community development, and other 
        public construction, provide State and local governments, 
        housing providers, and other recipients of this Federal 
        financial assistance with substantial funds for projects and 
        activities that produce significant economic opportunities for 
        the communities where the funds are expended;
            (2) low- and very low-income persons, especially recipients 
        of government assistance for housing, often face barriers to 
        access training, employment, and contracting opportunities 
        resulting from the expenditure of Federal funds in their 
        communities;
            (3) training, employment, and contracting opportunities 
        generated by projects and activities that receive assistance 
        from the Department of Housing and Urban Development offer an 
        effective means of empowering low- and very low-income persons 
        and local businesses that provide training and job 
        opportunities for such persons;
            (4) past Federal efforts to direct training, employment, 
        and contracting opportunities generated by programs 
        administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
        to low- and very low-income persons, and businesses that 
        provide training and job opportunities for such persons, have 
        not been fully effective and should be intensified; and
            (5) funding provided to other Federal agencies may also 
        produce significant employment and contracting opportunities 
        for the communities where the funds are expended.

SEC. 3. REPORTING; SANCTIONS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.

    Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 
U.S.C. 1701u) is amended--
