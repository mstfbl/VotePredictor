   To posthumously award a Congressional gold medal to Justin Smith 
Morrill, United States Senator of the State of Vermont, in recognition 
 of his lasting contributions to higher education opportunity for all 
                               Americans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Justin Smith Morrill Congressional 
Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that:
            (1) Justin Smith Morrill, the son of a blacksmith and 
        farmer, was born in Strafford, Vermont, on April 14, 1810. He 
        prospered as a merchant and businessman in his early years and 
        served in public office the remainder of his life.
            (2) Morrill, the longest serving Member of Congress in the 
        Nineteenth Century and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and 
        Means in the United States House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Finance in the United States Senate, served 5 
        terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1854 
        to 1869 and 6 terms in the United States Senate, from 1872 to 
        1898.
            (3) Morrill, inspired by his own lack of public education 
        opportunity beyond his fifteenth birthday, proposed legislation 
        that would set aside public lands to be sold by the States to 
        create and fund State-run colleges.
            (4) Congress enacted the First Morrill Act (7 U.S.C. 301 et 
        seq.) on July 2, 1862, marking the genesis of the national 
        focus on higher education in the United States through the 
        establishment of the land-grant institutions.
            (5) Congress enacted the Second Morrill Act (7 U.S.C. 321 
        et seq.) on August 30, 1890.
            (6) Land-grant and other public research universities today 
        award nearly 1,000,000 degrees annually and perform more than 
        $37,000,000,000 of research for improving the lives of 
        Americans.
            (7) In 1864, Morrill introduced House Joint Resolution 66 
        which created National Statuary Hall from the Old Hall of the 
        U.S. House of Representatives and authorized the President of 
        the United States to invite States to submit two statues of 
        worthy citizens to be exhibited, which continues as a daily 
        inspiration to the thousands of visitors to the United States 
        Capitol.
            (8) As chairman of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, 
        Morrill served as principal advocate for the construction and 
        financing of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of 
        Congress; for inviting Frederick Law Olmstead to design the 
        present landscape of the Capitol; for planning the location of 
        the United States Supreme Court Building; for raising funds to 
        complete the Washington Monument; and for championing the 
        Smithsonian Institution.
            (9) In delivering his last speech as Senator just two weeks 
        before his death, Morrill noted that the location of the United 
        States Supreme Court in close proximity to the United States 
        Capitol and the Library of Congress ``would form a harmonious 
        group of large public structures on Capitol Hill of unequaled 
        grandeur, and will be appreciated by the American people 
        forever''.
            (10) In his 1882 book ``Self-Consciousness of Noted 
        Persons'', Morrill concluded, ``The spur to acquire some future 
        reputation, to be earned by conscious fidelity, keeps the work 
        of men always at its best, the mechanic at the top of his 
        skill, the merchant ever mindful of the upright and downright 
        in trade; the pulpit and the bar it pushes on to effort and to 
        eloquence; it makes the soldier brave in battle, the politician 
        ashamed not be a patriot, and the statesman unwilling to give 
        up to party what was meant for mankind.''.
            (11) After Morrill died on December 28, 1898, eulogies 
        extolled Morrill's leadership, integrity and good-will, 
        including the comments of Senator George Graham Vest of 
        Missouri who stated, ``If all those to whom he did acts of 
        kindness could whisper across his grave, it would make an 
        anthem sweeter and more sonorous than any that ever pealed 
        through cathedral aisle'' and those of Senator George Hoar of 
        Massachusetts who recalled that Justin Morrill, ``knew in his 
        youth the veterans of the Revolution and the generation who 
        declared independence and framed the Constitution . . . . He 
        knew the whole history of his country from the time of her 
        independence, partly from the lips of those who shaped it, 
        partly because of the large share he had in it himself.''.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make

        appropriate locations associated with the life of Justin Smith 
        Morrill.

SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.

    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold
