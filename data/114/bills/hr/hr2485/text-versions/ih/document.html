                                 A BILL


 
   To establish in the Department of the Treasury an infrastructure 
   accelerator program to facilitate investments in and financing of

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Regional Infrastructure Accelerator 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purpose of this program is to facilitate and mobilize 
investment in, and the long-term financing of, economically viable 
covered infrastructure projects of regional or national significance by 
providing funding for these projects, including through private sector 
financing, to accelerate the delivery of high-quality, critical 
infrastructure through a self-sustaining regional infrastructure 
accelerator that mitigates risk with technical expertise and best 
practices.

SEC. 3. REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCELERATOR PROGRAM ESTABLISHED.

    (a) In General.--From amounts appropriated under paragraphs (1) and 
(3) of section 8, the Secretary of Treasury may establish a regional 
infrastructure accelerator program (in this section referred to as the 
``Program'') to provide grants to regional infrastructure accelerators 
to establish and administer a process for developing the priorities of 
and acquiring financing for covered infrastructure projects.
    (b) Program Structure.--The Program established pursuant to this 
Act shall include--
            (1) an initial grant to a regional infrastructure 
        accelerator that submits an application and a plan for 
        promoting investment in covered infrastructure projects; and
            (2) a subsequent grant to a regional infrastructure 
        accelerator for the purpose of awarding subgrants to one or 
        more State, local, or regional public entities to support 
        covered infrastructure projects and within the geographic area 
        represented by the regional infrastructure accelerator.

SEC. 4. INITIAL GRANTS TO REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCELERATORS.

    (a) Application.--A regional infrastructure accelerator that seeks 
a grant under this section shall submit an application to the Secretary 
at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the 
Secretary may reasonably require, including a plan that describes how 
the regional infrastructure accelerator will promote investment in 
covered infrastructure projects by--
            (1) providing guidance and feedback to State, local, or 
        regional public entities on infrastructure priorities, 
        financing strategies, and other matters relating to such 
        projects;
            (2) evaluating and promoting innovative financing methods;
            (3) connecting sources of financing to the State, local, or 
        regional public entities;
            (4) establishing standards to measure life-cycle costs of 
        investments in such projects, defined as budgetary impacts of 
        the design, development or construction, operations, and 
        maintenance of an infrastructure asset;
            (5) building capacity of State and local governments to 
        evaluate and structure projects involving the investment of 
        private capital; and
            (6) providing technical assistance and information on best 
        practices with respect to such projects which shall include--
