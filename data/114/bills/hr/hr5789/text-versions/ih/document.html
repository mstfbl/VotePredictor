 To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource 
    study of the site of the Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park in 
          Jessamine County, Kentucky, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Camp Nelson Heritage Park Study 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In June 1863, Camp Nelson was founded and constructed 
        by Major General Ambrose Burnside and the unit under his 
        command, the 9th Corps of the Army of Ohio.
            (2) Camp Nelson was established as a supply depot for the 
        Union Army during the Civil War and helped support the Union 
        Army's campaigns in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama.
            (3) Camp Nelson was one of the Nation's largest recruitment 
        and training centers for African-American soldiers during the 
        Civil War, as well as a refugee camp for the wives and children 
        of many of those soldiers.
            (4) Because of its proximity to Confederate States, 
        thousands of slaves fled to Camp Nelson with their families to 
        escape enslavement and to enlist in the Union Army, thereby 
        gaining their freedom.
            (5) Eight regiments of ``U.S. Colored Troops'', the 
        designation of African-American regiments at that time, were 
        founded at Camp Nelson, and three other regiments were trained 
        at the site.
            (6) Camp Nelson established a refugee camp for enlisted 
        African-American soldier's families, housing over 3,000 people, 
        primarily women and children, and included a school house, 
        hospital, mess hall, and other accommodations.
            (7) In 2008, Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park was 
        designated as part of the National Park Service's National 
        Underground Railroad Network to Freedom.
            (8) In 1998, Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park was 
        created by Jessamine County Fiscal Court using Federal, State, 
        and local support, and has preserved large tracts of this site, 
        constructed a visitor center, constructed a replica barracks, 
        recreated a fort, developed interpretive trails, and educated 
        the public about this historic site.
            (9) There is strong community interest in making Camp 
        Nelson Civil War Heritage Park a unit of the National Park 
        System.
            (10) Jessamine County Fiscal Court has expressed its desire 
        to donate the preserved historic site as a gift to the United 
        States.
