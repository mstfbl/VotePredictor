            (2) Calculation of federal tax burden.--For purposes of 
        calculating the Federal tax burden of each State under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) treat Federal taxes paid by an individual as a 
                burden on the State in which such individual resides; 
                and
                    (B) treat Federal taxes paid by a legal business 
                entity as a burden on each State in which economic 
                activity of such entity is performed in the same 
                proportion that the economic activity of such entity in 
                such State bears to the economic activity of such 
                entity in all the States.
    (b) State by State Calculation of Federal Outlays.--

        fiscal year.
            (2) Treatment of contract awards.--For purposes of 
        calculating the amount of Federal outlays received by a State 
        under paragraph (1), a Federal contract award shall be treated 
        as a Federal outlay received by each State in which performance 
        under the award takes place in the same proportion that such 
        performance in such State bears to such performance in all the 
        States.
    (c) State Defined.--In this section the term ``State'' means each 
of the several States.
