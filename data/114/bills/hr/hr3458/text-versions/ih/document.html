revenue mechanisms that preserve a user fee structure to maintain the 
long-term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund.
    (b) Objectives.--The objectives of the research, development, and 
demonstration described in subsection (a) shall be--
            (1) to study uncertainties relating to the design, 
        acceptance, and implementation of 2 or more future user-based 
        alternative revenue mechanisms;
            (2) to define the functionality of those user-based 
        alternative revenue mechanisms;
            (3) to conduct or promote research activities to 
        demonstrate and test those user-based alternative revenue 
        mechanisms, including by conducting field trials, by partnering 
        with individual States, groups of States, or other appropriate 
        entities to conduct the research activities;
            (4) to conduct outreach to increase public awareness 
        regarding the need for alternative funding sources for surface 
        transportation programs and provide information on possible 
        approaches;
            (5) to provide recommendations regarding adoption and 
        implementation of those user-based alternative revenue 
        mechanisms, and to assess the technical feasibility of value

        user-based alternative revenue mechanisms.
    (c) Grants.--The Secretary shall provide grants to individual 
States, groups of States, or other appropriate entities to conduct 
research, development, and demonstration that addresses--
            (1) the implementation, interoperability, and public 
        acceptance of, and other potential hurdles to, the adoption of 
        a user-based alternative revenue mechanism;
            (2) the protection of personal privacy;
            (3) the use of independent and private third-party vendors 
        to collect fees and operate the user-based alternative revenue 
        mechanism;
            (4) equity concerns, including the impacts of the user-
        based alternative revenue mechanism on differing income groups, 
        various geographic areas, and the relative burdens on rural and 
        urban drivers;
            (5) ease of compliance for different users of the 
        transportation system;
            (6) the reliability and security of technology used to 
        implement the user-based alternative revenue mechanism;

        revenue mechanisms, including the ability of users to select 
        from various technology and payment options;
            (8) the cost of administering the user-based alternative 
        revenue mechanism; and
