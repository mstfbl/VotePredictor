                                 A BILL


 
          To reduce childhood obesity, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Obesity in Schools Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) It is estimated that 34.9 percent (78.6 million) of 
        American adults and 17 percent (12,700,000) of American 
        children are overweight or obese.
            (2) The prevalence of obesity among children aged 6 to 11 
        more than doubled in the past 30 years, going from 7 percent in 
        1980 to 17.7 percent in 2012. The rate among adolescents aged 
        12 to 19 more than quadrupled, increasing from 5 percent to 
        20.5 percent.
            (3) An estimated 70 percent of overweight young people have 
        at least 1 additional risk factor for heart disease, such as 
        high cholesterol or high blood pressure. In addition, children 
        who are overweight are at greater risk for bone and joint 
        problems, sleep apnea, and social and psychological problems 
        such as stigmatization and poor self-esteem.
            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC), obesity-related medical costs in the United 
        States are approximately $147,000,000,000. On average, medical 
        spending for an obese individual is $1,429 higher per year than 
        for someone of normal weight.
            (5) A report released by Trust for America's Health, 
        entitled ``F as in Fat: How Obesity Policies are Failing in 
        America'', found that the United States does not have an 
        aggressive, coordinated national strategy as needed to address 
        this crisis.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO REDUCE CHILDHOOD OBESITY.

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with 
State, local, and tribal governments, Federal agencies, local 
educational agencies, health care providers, the research community, 
and the private sector, shall develop a national strategy to reduce 
childhood obesity in the United States. Such strategy shall--
            (1) provide for the reduction of childhood obesity rates by 
        10 percent by the year 2020;
            (2) address both short- and long-term solutions to reducing 
        the rates of childhood obesity in the United States;
            (3) identify how the Federal Government can work 
        effectively with State, local, and tribal governments, local 
        educational agencies, health care providers, the research 
        community, the private sector, and other entities as necessary 
        to implement the strategy; and
            (4) include measures to identify and overcome all obstacles 
        to achieving the goal of reducing childhood obesity in the 
        United States.
