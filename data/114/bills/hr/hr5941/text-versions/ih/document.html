    To provide for congressional review of transfers of funds from 
   Executive agencies to state sponsors of terrorism, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Taxpayer Dollars Safe from 
Terrorists Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SUBMISSION TO CONGRESS OF NOTICE OF INTENDED TRANSFER OF FUNDS 
              TO STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.

    (a) In General.--Before an Executive agency transfers funds to a 
state sponsor of terrorism, the head of the agency shall submit a 
written notice of such intended transfer to Congress for review in 
accordance with this Act.
    (b) Exemption for Humanitarian Assistance.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (a), any transfer of funds to a state sponsor of terrorism 
for the purpose of providing humanitarian assistance is not subject to 
the requirements of this Act.
    (c) Delay Before Transfer Takes Effect.--An intended transfer 
described in subsection (a) shall not take effect until the latest of--
            (1) the date occurring 60 days after the date on which 
        Congress receives the written notice of the intended transfer 
        under such subsection;
            (2) if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval 
        described in section 3 relating to the intended transfer, and 
        the President signs a veto of such resolution, the earlier 
        date--
                    (A) on which either House of Congress votes and 
                fails to override the veto of the President; or
                    (B) occurring 30 session days after the date on 
                which Congress received the veto and objections of the 
                President; or
            (3) the date the transfer would have otherwise taken 
        effect, if not for this section (unless a joint resolution of 
        disapproval under section 3 is enacted).
    (d) Transfer Not Permitted if Congress Enacts Joint Resolution of 
Disapproval.--An intended transfer described in subsection (a) shall 
not take effect if Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval of 
the transfer under section 3.
    (e) Special Rule for Review Near End of Session of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of any intended transfer 
        described in subsection (a) for which the written notice was 
        submitted in accordance with such subsection during the period 
        beginning on the date occurring--
                    (A) in the case of the Senate, 60 session days; or
                    (B) in the case of the House of Representatives, 60 
                legislative days,
        before the date that Congress adjourns a session of Congress 
        through the date on which the same or succeeding Congress first 
        convenes its next session, section 3 shall apply to such 
        transfer in the succeeding session of Congress.
            (2) Timing of submission of notice for purposes of 
        resolutions of disapproval.--In applying section 3 for purposes 
        of review under this subsection, an intended transfer described 
        under subsection (a) shall be treated as though the head of the 
        Executive agency submitted the written notice of the intended 
        transfer to Congress--
                    (A) in the case of the Senate, the 15th session 
                day; or
                    (B) in the case of the House of Representatives, 
                the 15th legislative day,
        after the succeeding session of Congress first convenes.
    (f) Rule of Construction.--If Congress does not enact a joint 
resolution of disapproval under section 3 respecting an intended 
transfer described in subsection (a), no court or agency may infer any 
intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the Congress with 
regard to such transfer or joint resolution of disapproval.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURES.

    (a) Description of Joint Resolution of Disapproval.--For purposes 
of this section, the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint 
resolution introduced in the period beginning on the date on which the 
written notice of an intended transfer referred to in section 2(a) is 
received by Congress and ending 60 days thereafter (excluding days 
either House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days during a 
session of Congress), the matter after the resolving clause of which is 
as follows: ``That Congress disapproves the intended transfer submitted 
by the ____ relating to ____, and such transfer shall have no force or 
effect.'' (The blank spaces being appropriately filled in).
    (b) Referral to Committees of Jurisdiction.--A joint resolution 
described in subsection (a) shall be referred to the committees in each 
House of Congress with jurisdiction.
    (c) Discharge of Committee in Senate.--In the Senate, if the 
committee to which is referred a joint resolution described in 
subsection (a) has not reported such joint resolution (or an identical 
joint resolution) at the end of 20 calendar days after the written 
notice of the intended transfer under section 2(a) is received by 
Congress, such committee may be discharged from further consideration 
of such joint resolution upon a petition supported in writing by 30 
Members of the Senate, and such joint resolution shall be placed on the 
calendar.
    (d) Procedures for Expedited Consideration of Joint Resolution in 
Senate.--(1) In the Senate, when the committee to which a joint 
resolution is referred has reported, or when a committee is discharged 
(under subsection (c) from further consideration of a joint resolution 
described in subsection (a), it is at any time thereafter in order 
(even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed 
to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint 
resolution, and all points of order against the joint resolution (and 
against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. The motion 
is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion 
to proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to 
reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to 
shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
the joint resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain 
the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.
    (2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on all 
debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
favoring and those opposing the joint resolution. A motion further to 
limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a 
motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in 
order.
    (3) In the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of the 
debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a), and a single 
quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance 
with the rules of the Senate, the vote on final passage of the joint 
resolution shall occur.
    (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure relating to a 
joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall be decided without 
debate.
    (e) Deadline for Application of Procedures for Expedited 
Consideration in Senate.--In the Senate, the procedure specified in 
subsection (c) or (d) shall not apply to the consideration of a joint 
resolution respecting an intended transfer--
            (1) after the expiration of the 60 session days beginning 
        with the date on which the written notice of the intended 
        transfer under section 2(a) is received by Congress; or
            (2) if the written notice of the intended transfer was 
        submitted during the period referred to in section 2(e)(1), 
        after the expiration of the 60 session days beginning on the 
        15th session day after the succeeding session of Congress first 
        convenes.
    (f) Coordination of Actions Between House and Senate.--If, before 
the passage by one House of a joint resolution of that House described 
in subsection (a), that House receives from the other House a joint 
resolution described in subsection (a), then the following procedures 
shall apply:
            (1) The joint resolution of the other House shall not be 
        referred to a committee.
            (2) With respect to a joint resolution described in 
        subsection (a) of the House receiving the joint resolution--
                    (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same 
                as if no joint resolution had been received from the 
                other House; but
                    (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint 
                resolution of the other House.
    (g) Exercise of Rulemaking Authority.--This section is enacted by 
Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a joint resolution described in 
        subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the 
        extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
