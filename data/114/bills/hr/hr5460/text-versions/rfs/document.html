        uniform process for reviewing applications that, in accordance 
        with paragraph (1), contain explanations to use grants provided 
        under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or systems 
        that do not meet or exceed any applicable national voluntary

        Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 747).

                systems by Federal agencies or the Armed Forces.
                    ``(B) The absence of a national voluntary consensus 
                standard for such equipment or systems.
                    ``(C) The existence of an international consensus 
                standard for such equipment or systems, and whether

                address such gap.
                    ``(E) The degree to which such equipment or systems 
                will serve the needs of the applicant better than 
                equipment or systems that meet or exceed existing 
                consensus standards.
                    ``(F) Any other factor determined appropriate by 
                the Administrator.''.
