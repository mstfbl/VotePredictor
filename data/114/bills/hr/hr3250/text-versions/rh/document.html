            ``(2) In determining the amount of a civil penalty under 
        this subsection for a person who is a retailer, the Secretary 
        shall consider whether the retailer has taken appropriate steps 
        to prevent subsequent violations, such as the establishment and 
        administration of a documented employee training program to 
        ensure all employees are familiar with and abiding by the 
        provisions of section 301(ddd), where such program includes--

        occur.
            ``(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        subsection or section 301(ddd), an employee shall not be 
        subject to penalties under this subsection unless such employee 
        knowingly and willfully participates in a conspiracy to violate 
        section 301(ddd). For purposes of this paragraph, a conspiracy 
        shall consist of an agreement between two or more persons with

        least one overt act in furtherance of the agreement.
