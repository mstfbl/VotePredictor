        Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including how to ensure 
        that the initiative--

                motor carriers transporting passengers and motor 
                carriers transporting freight;

                        crashes with respect to which a motor carrier 
                        was free from fault.
            (2) Free from fault.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1)(F)(iii), a motor carrier is free from fault with respect to

                        operated;
                            (iv) struck the carrier's vehicle while the 
                        vehicle was legally stopped at a traffic 
                        control device or off the traveled portion of a 
                        roadway; or

                                contributed to the crash;
                    (B) the crash was the result of an individual, 
                other than the driver of the carrier's vehicle, 
                committing suicide;
                    (C) the vehicle of the carrier was struck by an 
                animal; or
