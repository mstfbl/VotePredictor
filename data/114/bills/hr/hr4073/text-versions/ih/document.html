_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to establish a 
                   permanent background check system.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Child Protection Improvements Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Next Generation Identification System of the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains fingerprints and 
        criminal history records on more than 71,000,000 individuals.
            (2) Congress has worked with the States to make criminal 
        history background checks available to organizations seeking to 
        screen employees and volunteers who work with children, the 
        elderly, and individuals with disabilities, through the 
        National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.), 
        the Volunteers for Children Act (Public Law 105-251; 112 Stat. 
        1885), the Serve America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 
        1460), the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 
        (Public Law 109-248; 120 Stat. 587), and statutes enacted by 48 
        States in compliance with Public Law 92-544. However, there may 
        still be persons providing care and services to vulnerable 
        populations who fall outside these numerous and broad 
        categories of criminal history background checks authorized by 
        Federal and State law.

SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.

    The National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.) 
is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 5 as section 6; and
            (2) by inserting after section 4 the following:
