 To prohibit the receipt of Federal financial assistance by sanctuary 
                    cities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SANCTUARY CITIES INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

    Any State or local government that violates section 642 of the 
Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 
U.S.C. 1373) may not receive any Federal financial assistance (as such 
term is defined in section 7501(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code). 
The Attorney General shall determine annually which State or local 
jurisdictions are not in compliance with section 642 of the Illegal 
Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and shall report 
such determinations to Congress on March 1 of each year. The Attorney 
General shall also issue a report concerning the compliance of any 
particular State or local jurisdiction at the request of any Member of 
Congress. Any jurisdiction that is found to be out of compliance shall 
be ineligible to receive Federal financial assistance for a minimum 
period of one year, and shall only become eligible again after the 
Attorney General certifies that the jurisdiction is in compliance.
                                 <all>
