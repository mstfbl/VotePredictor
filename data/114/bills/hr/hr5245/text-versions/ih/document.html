treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or deceptive act or 
practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)). The Federal Trade Commission 
shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with 
the same jurisdiction as though all applicable terms and provisions of

            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (6), in 
        any case in which the attorney general of a State has reason to 
        believe that an interest of the residents of that State has 
        been or is threatened or adversely affected by the engagement 
        of any person in a practice that violates a rule prescribed 
        under section 3 or 4, the State, as parens patriae, may bring a 
        civil action on behalf of the residents of the State in an 
        appropriate district court of the United States or other court

                compensation on behalf of residents of the State; and
                    (D) obtain such other relief as the court may 
                consider to be appropriate.

        days prior to initiating such civil action. The notice shall 
        include a copy of the complaint to be filed to initiate such 
        civil action, except that if it is not feasible for the State 
        to provide such prior notice, the State shall provide notice 
        immediately upon instituting such civil action.

                action;
                    (B) remove the action to the appropriate United 
                States district court; and

        powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of such 
        State to conduct investigations or to administer oaths or 
        affirmations or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the 
        production of documentary and other evidence. Nothing in this 
        section shall prohibit the attorney general of a State, or 
        other authorized State officer, from proceeding in State or

        brought under paragraph (1)--
                    (A) the venue shall be a judicial district in which 
                the defendant or a related party is found, is an 
                inhabitant, or transacts business, or wherever venue is 
                proper under section 1391 of title 28, United States

                person.
            (6) Preemptive action by ftc.--Whenever a civil action or 
        an administrative action has been instituted by or on behalf of 
        the Commission for violation of any rule described under 
        paragraph (1), no State may, during the pendency of such action 
        instituted by or on behalf of the Commission, institute a civil 
        action under paragraph (1) against any defendant named in the

        in such complaint.
            (7) Award of costs and fees.--If a State prevails in any 
        civil action under paragraph (1), the State can recover 
        reasonable costs and attorney fees from the lender or related

forth in such sections that such person violated with respect to a 
ticket sold to the person bringing such action, and reasonable 
attorneys' fees and costs.

SEC. 6. NONPREEMPTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall affect the authority of any State or 
local government to establish or continue in effect a provision of law 
of the State or local government relating to the regulation of the 
resale of tickets to events or the pricing of such tickets for resale, 
except to the extent that such provision is inconsistent with this Act 
or a regulation promulgated under this Act, and then only to the extent 
of the inconsistency. A provision of law of a State or local government 
is not inconsistent with this Act or a regulation promulgated under 
this Act if such provision provides equal or greater protection to 
consumers than the protection provided under this Act or such 
regulation.

SEC. 7. FTC STUDY OF TICKET MARKET.

    (a) Study.--The Federal Trade Commission shall conduct a study of 
the ticket market to determine--
            (1) who is purchasing tickets from primary ticket sellers 
        and how many of these tickets are later resold by secondary 
        ticket sales marketplaces;
            (2) the impact on consumers of nontransferable tickets and 
        whether all tickets should be required to be transferable; and
            (3) the extent to which automated ticketing-purchasing 
        programs and other computer software is used to purchase 
        tickets or circumvent ticketing website safeguards used by 
        primary ticket sellers.
    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Commission shall transmit a report to Congress containing 
the findings of the study.
