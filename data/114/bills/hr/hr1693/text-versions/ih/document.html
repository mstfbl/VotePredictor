SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``White House Accountability Act of 
2015''.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) That the President has failed to fulfill his duty to 
        enforce immigration law.
            (2) That our national security is the primary 
        responsibility of the United States Federal Government.
            (3) That it stands to reason that when you do not fulfill 
        your responsibilities, you typically lose your compensation.

    Of the funds made available for fiscal year 2015 for ``The White 
House--Salaries and Expenses'', the unobligated balance is rescinded.
