                        expenses (other than for operations, 
                        maintenance, and capital improvements) include

                        State law provides that such a company or 
                        organization may be organized in a manner that

                        governance matters per share held in the 
                        corporation. Nothing in this clause shall be 
                        construed to create any inference about the

                        or organizations not included in this 
                        clause.''.
