        that satisfies the following requirements:
                    ``(A) The Act shall contain a finding--
                            ``(i) that there is an ongoing armed 
                        conflict within the state and, due to such 
                        conflict, requiring the return of aliens who 
                        are nationals of that state (or to the part of 
                        the state) would pose a serious threat to their 
                        personal safety;
                            ``(ii) that--

                                immediately life-threatening 
                                environmental disaster in the state 
                                resulting in a substantial, but 
                                temporary, disruption of living 
                                conditions in the area affected;
                                    ``(II) the foreign state is unable, 
                                temporarily, to handle adequately the 
                                return to the state of aliens who are 
                                nationals of the state; and
                                    ``(III) the foreign state 
                                officially has requested designation 
                                under this subparagraph; or
                            ``(iii) that there exist extraordinary and 
                        temporary conditions in the foreign state that 
                        prevent aliens who are nationals of the state 
                        from returning to the state in safety and that 
                        permitting the aliens to remain temporarily in 
                        the United States is not contrary to the 
                        national interest of the United States.
                    ``(B) The Act shall include--

                        within the effective period of the designation 
                        are likely to become) eligible for temporary 
                        protected status under this section;
                            ``(ii) such nationals' immigration status 
                        in the United States; and
                            ``(iii) a time period for the effectiveness 
                        of the designation that is not greater than 18 
                        months.
            ``(2) Termination.--
                    ``(A) Timely termination.--If an initial 
                designation of a foreign state is not extended under

                at the end of the time period described in paragraph 
                (1)(B)(iii).
                    ``(B) Early termination.--For purposes of this 
                section, the designation of a foreign state shall be

                state) no longer meets the conditions for designation 
                under paragraph (1)(A).
            ``(3) Extension.--For purposes of this section, the time 
        period for the effectiveness of the designation of a foreign 
        state shall be extended upon the enactment of an Act that 
        includes--

                under paragraph (1)(A) continue to be met; and

                extension that is not greater than 12 months.''; and
            (2) in paragraph (5)(A), by striking ``of the Attorney 
        General'' and inserting ``made in any Act''.

of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(c)(2)(B)) is

                        immigration status.''.

Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a et seq.) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (d)(3), by striking ``If the Attorney 
        General terminates the designation of a foreign state (or part 
        of such foreign state) under subsection (b)(3)(B)'' and
