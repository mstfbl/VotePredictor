SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Trials Modernization Act of

SEC. 2. CLINICAL TRIAL MODERNIZATION.

    (a) Proposals for Use of Innovative Statistical Methods in Clinical 
Protocols for Drugs, Biological Products, and Devices.--Chapter V of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended by inserting after 
section 506F (21 U.S.C. 356f) the following new section:

``SEC. 507. CLINICAL TRIAL MODERNIZATION.

    ``(a) In General.--To promote the efficiency of the development and 
regulatory review and approval, licensure, or clearance of drugs, 
biological products, and devices and the timely availability of 
innovative treatments, the Secretary shall, after providing notice and 
an opportunity for public comment, establish and implement a framework 
through which--
            ``(1) sponsors of drugs, biological products, or devices 
        may submit to the Secretary a proposal for the incorporation of 
        adaptive trial designs, Bayesian methods, or other alternative 
        statistical methods into proposed clinical protocols and 
        marketing applications for drugs, biological products, or 
        devices; and
            ``(2) the Secretary will commit to timelines for reviewing 
        and providing feedback on proposals so submitted.''.
    (b) Guidance Addressing Use of Adaptive Trial Designs and Bayesian 
Methods.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human

                addressing the use of adaptive trial design for drugs 
                and biological products; and
                    (B) issue draft guidance on the use of Bayesian 
                methods in the development and regulatory review and 
                approval, licensure, or clearance of drugs, biological 
                products, and devices.
            (2) Contents.--The guidances under paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) establish or clarify standards for using 
                adaptive trial designs and Bayesian methods in clinical 
                trials, including clinical trials that form the primary 
                basis for approval, clearance, or licensure of the 
                products involved (such as trials that provide 
                substantial evidence for the approval of drugs);
                    (B) establish a mechanism for sponsors to obtain 
                feedback from the Secretary under section 507, as added

                        simulations; or
                            (ii) the submission of resulting 
                        information to the Secretary;
                    (C) specify the types of quantitative and 
                qualitative information required for review; and
                    (D) specify the recommended analysis methodology.
