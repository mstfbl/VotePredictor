                To authorize a nuclear physics program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. NUCLEAR PHYSICS PROGRAM.

    (a) Program.--As part of the activities authorized under section 
209 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7139), the 
Director shall carry out a research program, and support relevant 
facilities, to discover and understand various forms of nuclear matter.
    (b) Facility Construction.--
            (1) In general.--Consistent with the Office of Science's 
        project management practices, the Director shall continue to 
        support the construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope 
        Beams.
            (2) Repeal.--Section 981 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 
        (42 U.S.C. 16321) is repealed.
    (c) Isotope Development and Production for Research Applications.--
            (1) In general.--The Director shall carry out a program for 
        the production of isotopes that the Director determines are 
        needed for research and applications, including--
                    (A) the development of techniques to produce 
                isotopes; and
                    (B) support for infrastructure required for isotope 
                research and production.
            (2) Coordination.--In making the determination described in 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) ensure that isotope production activities do 
                not compete with private industry unless critical 
                national interests necessitate the Federal Government's 
                involvement; and
                    (B) consider any relevant recommendations made by 
                Federal advisory committees, the National Academies, 
                and interagency working groups in which the Department 
                participates.
                                 <all>
