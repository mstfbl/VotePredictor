               of urbanized area, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF URBANIZED AREA.

    Section 5302(23) of title 49, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``The term'' and inserting the following:
                    ``(A) In general.--The term''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(B) Additional areas.--Notwithstanding 
                subparagraph (A), an area shall be treated as an 
                `urbanized area' if the Secretary of Commerce 
                determines that--
                            ``(i) the area was defined and designated 
                        in a previous decennial census as an `urbanized 
                        area';
                            ``(ii) the area was not defined and 
                        designated in the most recent decennial census 
                        as an `urbanized area' as the result of a 
                        natural disaster that caused the population of 
                        the area to fall below 50,000 people; and
                            ``(iii) the most recent annual estimate of 
                        the Bureau of the Census estimates the 
                        population of the area to be restored to 50,000 
                        or more people.''.
