                                 A BILL


 
      To streamline and harmonize Federal research regulations on 
       institutions of higher education, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``University Regulation Streamlining 
and Harmonization Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The partnership between the Federal Government and 
        institutions of higher education, affiliated medical centers, 
        and independent research institutes has been enormously 
        beneficial for the Nation, providing economic growth, a highly 
        skilled workforce, and discoveries that have improved people's 
        lives.
            (2) Regulation of federally funded research institutions, 
        when done efficiently, serves to ensure that taxpayer dollars 
        are spent wisely and that human and animal research subjects 
        are treated ethically.
            (3) A survey conducted by the Federal Demonstration 
        Partnership in 2012 found that 42 percent of faculty time 
        related to the conduct of federally funded research at research 
        institutions is spent on activities other than research, with 
        19.3 percent specifically related to administrative activities.
            (4) A study of the Federal regulatory impact on institutes 
        of higher education led by Vanderbilt University involving 13 
        public and private universities estimated that the total cost 
        of compliance with research regulations for all research 
        institutions ranged from 11 to 25 percent of total research 
        expenditures and reached an estimated 10 billion dollars across 
        the country.
            (5) Advances in technology, recordkeeping, and internal 
        controls allow awardees to document charges to Federal awards 
        for salaries and wages in increasingly efficient ways, 
        including through payroll certification, which can increase 
        accountability and reduce burdens relative to personal activity 
        reports.
            (6) Past efforts by the Federal Government, in particular 
        through the Uniform Guidance implemented by the Office of 
        Management and Budget in 2014, have made progress in reducing 
        regulatory burdens. However, problems still remain as noted by 
        the National Academies' report in September of 2015, which 
        found that ``continuing expansion of the Federal regulatory 
        system and its ever-growing requirements are diminishing the 
        effectiveness of the nation's research investment by directing 
        investigators' time away from research''.
            (7) Streamlining research regulations and moving toward 
        harmonized regulations based on data-driven cost-benefit 
        analyses across Federal research funding agencies will help 
        maximize the impact of research dollars while minimizing waste, 
        fraud, and abuse.

        of the database across Federal research funding agencies;
            (4) ensure that the database developed is the least 
        burdensome possible for research institutions applying for 
        Federal grants that still allows for the collection of 
        information necessary for Federal research funding agencies;
            (5) determine whether the database can be made more 
        efficient through linkages to databases developed under the 
        public access plans of Federal research funding agencies 
        (pursuant to the memorandum on ``Increasing Access to the 
        Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research'' published by
