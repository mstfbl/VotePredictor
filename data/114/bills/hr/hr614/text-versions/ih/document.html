SEC. 307. INCREASE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF FEDERAL BUILDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address 
        the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.
            (2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion 
        annually in energy costs.
            (3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, 
        create jobs, and reduce waste.
            (4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy 
        savings contracts are tools for utilizing private sector 
        investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front 
        cost to the taxpayer.
            (5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal 
        buildings using private sector investment in the absence of 
        appropriated dollars. Retrofits seek to reduce energy use, 
        improve infrastructure, protect national security, and cut 
        facility operations and maintenance costs.
    (b) Use of Energy and Water Efficiency Measures in Federal 
Buildings.--
            (1) Implementation of identified energy and water 
        efficiency measures.--Section 543(f)(4) of the National Energy 
        Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(4)) is amended to 
        read as follows:
            ``(4) Implementation of identified energy and water 
        efficiency measures.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the 
                completion of each evaluation under paragraph (3), each
