_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
    program to improve treatment for veterans suffering from opioid 
          addiction and chronic pain, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Our Veterans with Chronic 
Pain and Opioid Addiction Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many veterans and their families have been affected by 
        the national opioid epidemic caused in part by the prescription 
        of opioid medication to manage pain.
            (2) Prescription opioid overdose rates for veterans 
        receiving medical care furnished by the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs are twice the national average.
            (3) More than 50 percent of veterans receiving such care 
        are suffering from chronic pain.
            (4) Almost one in three veterans receiving such care are 
        prescribed opioids to manage pain.
            (5) Many veterans prescribed opioids for the management of 
        chronic pain are at risk of developing a dependency on opioids.
            (6) Many veterans receive health care from both the 
        Department and community providers but the lack of care 
        coordination among the Department and community providers when 
        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for 
        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite 
        health care resources.
            (7) Veteran-centric care coordination is associated with 
        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department 
        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the 
        best care for veterans.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) veterans suffering from opioid dependency should 
        receive timely access to treatment and social services at 
        Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or through qualified 
        community providers and should have care and services managed 
        and coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs;
            (2) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs to receive opioid addiction treatment in the 
        community must not lose the high quality, safety, care 
        coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the 
        health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        provides; and
            (3) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from a 
        community provider, such care must be secured in a cost-
        effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health 
        care system of the Department by using industry standards for 
        care and costs.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS SUFFERING FROM 
              OPIOID ADDICTION AND CHRONIC PAIN.

    (a) In General.--Beginning not later than 120 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
conduct a pilot program under which the Secretary provides health and 
social services and coordination of care and case management to covered 
veterans in need of treatment for opioid addiction and chronic pain 
through facilities of the Department and through qualified non-
Department health care providers.
    (b) Program Locations.--
            (1) In general.--The pilot program shall be carried out 
        within at least five areas within different States.
            (2) Selection.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall select five 
                States with Department medical facilities to 
                participate in the pilot program. Each of the five 
                Department facilities selected shall be located in 
                States that demonstrate--
                            (i) the need for additional resources to 
                        provide health care services, including mental 
                        health, chronic pain management and social 
                        services to veterans in need of treatment for 
                        opioid abuse based upon the community 
                        assessment in subsection (a) of this section;
                            (ii) demographic, population, and census 
                        data showing the highest rates per capita of 
                        opioid addiction in the United States or 
                        greater demand in the veteran patient 
                        population than capacity in facilities of the 
                        Department for treatment for opioid addiction; 
                        and
                            (iii) lack of sufficient Department 
                        capacity to meet the demand of all patients in 
                        need of treatment for opioid addiction.
                    (B) Other requirements.--In addition to the 
                requirements in subparagraph (A), not fewer than four 
                of the five selected States shall include--
                            (i) at least one highly rural county, as 
                        determined by the Secretary upon consideration 
                        of the most recent decennial census with the 
                        highest per capita rate of opioid addiction;
                            (ii) an urban county as determined by the 
                        Secretary upon consideration of the most recent 
                        decennial census with the largest population 
                        per capita of opioid addiction;
                            (iii) a county as determined by the 
                        Secretary in a State with one of the highest 
                        statistically significant drug and opioid 
                        overdose death rate increases from 2013 to 2014 
                        according to the Centers for Disease Control 
                        and Prevention and a low expenditure of funding 
                        per capita on substance abuse treatment in 
                        comparison to other States; and
                            (iv) a county as determined by the 
                        Secretary in a State with a high rate per 
                        capita of veterans diagnosed with chronic pain 
                        and prescribed prescription opioids.

        by the Department when care is provided by community providers; 
        and
            (5) the manner by which the Department ensures placement of 
        veterans in need of treatment for opioid dependency in 
        treatment programs within a clinically sufficient time period 
        according to published practice guidelines for the treatment of 
        patients with opioid dependency.
    (b) Assessment of Non-Department Capabilities.--In addition to the 
assessment required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall

diagnosed with an opioid addiction and for the treatment of veterans 
suffering from chronic pain.
    (c) Community Providers.--In this section, the term ``community
