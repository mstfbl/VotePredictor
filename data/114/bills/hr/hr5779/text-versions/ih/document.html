United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Automatic Voter 
Registration Act of 2016''.
    (b) Findings and Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the right to vote is a fundamental right of 
                citizens of the United States;
                    (B) it is the responsibility of the State and 
                Federal Governments to ensure that every eligible 
                citizen is registered to vote;
                    (C) existing voter registration systems can be 
                inaccurate, costly, inaccessible and confusing, with 
                damaging effect on voter participation in elections and 
                disproportionate impact on young people, persons with 
                disabilities, and racial and ethnic minorities; and
                    (D) voter registration systems must be updated with 
                21st century technologies and procedures.
            (2) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--
                    (A) to establish that it is the responsibility of 
                government at every level to ensure that all eligible 
                citizens are registered to vote;
                    (B) to enable the State and Federal Governments to 
                register all eligible citizens to vote with accurate, 
                cost-efficient, and up-to-date procedures;
                    (C) to modernize voter registration and list 
                maintenance procedures with electronic and Internet 
                capabilities; and
                    (D) to protect and enhance the integrity, accuracy, 
                efficiency, and accessibility of the electoral process.

SEC. 2. AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Requiring States To Establish and Operate Automatic 
Registration System.--
            (1) In general.--The chief State election official of each 
        State shall establish and operate a system of automatic 
        registration for the registration of eligible individuals to 
        vote for elections for Federal office in the State, in 
        accordance with the provisions of this Act.
            (2) Definition.--The term ``automatic registration'' means 
        a system that registers an individual to vote in elections for 
        Federal office in a State, if eligible, by electronically 
        transferring the information necessary for registration from 
        government agencies to election officials of the State so that, 
        unless the individual affirmatively declines to be registered, 
        the individual will be registered to vote in such elections.
    (b) Registration of Voters Based on New Agency Records.--The chief 
State election official shall--
            (1) ensure that any individual who is eligible to register 
        to vote in elections for Federal office in the State is 
        promptly registered to vote after the individual has not 
        declined registration and the individual's information has been 
        transmitted by a contributing agency pursuant to section 3; and
            (2) send written notice to the individual, in addition to 
        other means of notice established by this Act, of the 
        individual's voter registration status.
    (c) One-Time Registration of Voters Based on Existing Contributing 
Agency Records.--The chief State election official shall--
            (1) identify all individuals whose information is 
        transmitted by a contributing agency pursuant to section 4 and 
        who are eligible to be, but are not currently, registered to 
        vote in that State;
            (2) promptly send each such individual written notice, in 
        addition to other means of notice established by this Act, 
        which shall not identify the contributing agency that 
        transmitted the information but shall include--
                    (A) an explanation that voter registration is 
                voluntary, but if the individual does not decline 
                registration, the individual will be registered to 
                vote;
                    (B) a statement offering the opportunity to decline 
                voter registration through any means set forth by the 
                State consistent with this Act's requirements;
                    (C) in the case of a State in which affiliation or 
                enrollment with a political party is required in order 
                to participate in an election to select the party's 
                candidate in an election for Federal office, a 
                statement offering the individual the opportunity to 
                affiliate or enroll with a political party or to 
                decline to affiliate or enroll with a political party, 
                through such means as the State may establish 
                consistent with the requirements of this Act;
                    (D) the substantive qualifications of an elector in 
                the State;
                    (E) the instruction that the individual should 
                decline registration if ineligible to vote;
                    (F) instructions for correcting an erroneous 
                registration; and
                    (G) instructions for providing any additional 
                information which is required under State law for voter 
                registration purposes and reasonably related to the 
                management of elections;
            (3) ensure that each such individual who is eligible to 
        register to vote in elections for Federal office in the State 
        is promptly registered to vote, unless the individual declines 
        registration by providing the appropriate State election 
        official with notice within the specified time period; and
            (4) send written notice to each such individual, in 
        addition to other means of notice established by this Act, of 
        the individual's voter registration status.
    (d) Contributing Agency Defined.--In this Act, the term 
``contributing agency'' means, with respect to a State, an agency 
listed in section 3(e).

SEC. 3. CONTRIBUTING AGENCY ASSISTANCE IN REGISTRATION.

    (a) In General.--Each contributing agency in a State shall assist 
the State's chief election official in registering to vote all eligible 
individuals served by that agency, in accordance with this Act.
    (b) Requirements for Contributing Agencies.--
            (1) Instructions on automatic registration.--With each 
        application for service or assistance, and with each related 
        recertification, renewal, or change of address, or, in the case 
        of an institution of higher education, with each registration 
        of a student for enrollment in a course of study, each 
        contributing agency that (in the normal course of its 
        operations) requests individuals applying for service or 
        assistance to provide citizenship information shall inform the 
        individual of the following:
                    (A) Unless that individual declines to register to 
                vote, or is found ineligible to vote, the individual 
                will be registered to vote or, if applicable, the 
                individual's registration will be updated.
                    (B) The substantive qualifications of an elector in 
                the State, the consequences of false registration, and 
                that the individual should not register if the 
                individual does not meet all those qualifications.
                    (C) In the case of a State in which affiliation or 
                enrollment with a political party is required in order 
                to participate in an election to select the party's 
                candidate in an election for Federal office, the 
                requirement that the individual must affiliate or 
                enroll with a political party in order to participate 
                in such an election.
                    (D) Voter registration is voluntary, and that 
                neither registering nor declining to register to vote 
                will in any way affect the availability of services or 
                benefits, nor be used for other purposes.
            (2) Opportunity to decline registration required.--Each 
        contributing agency shall ensure that each application for 
        service or assistance, and each related recertification, 
        renewal, or change of address, or, in the case of an 
        institution of higher education, each registration of a student 
        for enrollment in a course of study, cannot be completed until 
        the individual is given the opportunity to decline to be 
        registered to vote.
            (3) Information transmittal.--For each individual who does 
        not decline voter registration, each contributing agency shall 
        electronically transmit to the appropriate State election 
        official, in a format compatible with the statewide voter 
        database maintained under section 303 of the Help America Vote 
        Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21083), and in a manner that ensures 
        timely voter registration--
                    (A) the individual's given name(s) and surname(s);
                    (B) the individual's date of birth;
                    (C) the individual's residential address;
                    (D) information showing that the individual is a 
                citizen of the United States, which may include an 
                affirmation made by the individual under penalty of 
                perjury that the individual is a citizen of the United 
                States;
                    (E) any valid driver's license number or the last 4 
                digits of the individual's social security number;
                    (F) the date on which information pertaining to 
                that individual was collected or last updated;
                    (G) the individual's signature, in electronic form;
                    (H) information regarding the individual's 
                affiliation or enrollment with a political party, if 
                the individual provides such information;
                    (I) any affirmation the State may request of the 
                veracity of the information supplied by the individual 
                pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (H); and
                    (J) any additional information which is required 
                under State law for voter registration purposes and 
                reasonably related to the management of elections, and 
                which is not otherwise collected by the agency in its 
                normal course of business.
    (c) Alternate Procedure for Certain Contributing Agencies.--With 
each application for service or assistance, and with each related 
recertification, renewal, or change of address, or in the case of an 
institution of higher education, with each registration of a student 
for enrollment in a course of study, any contributing agency that does 
not request or record information concerning the citizenship status of 
applicants for its services shall--
            (1) complete the requirements of section 7(a)(6) of the 
        National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 
        20506(a)(6));
            (2) ensure that each applicant's transaction with the 
        agency cannot be completed until the applicant has indicated 
        whether the applicant wishes to register to vote in elections 
        for Federal office held in the State; and
            (3) for each individual who wishes to register to vote, 
        transmit that individual's information in accordance with 
        subsection (b)(3).
    (d) Required Availability of Automatic Registration Opportunity 
With Each Application for Service or Assistance.--Each contributing 
agency shall offer each individual, with each application for service 
or assistance, and with each related recertification, renewal, or 
change of address, or in the case of an institution of higher 
education, with each registration of a student for enrollment in a 
course of study, the opportunity to register to vote as prescribed by 
this section without regard to whether the individual previously 
declined a registration opportunity.
    (e) Contributing Agencies.--
            (1) State agencies.--In each State, each of the following

                    (E) In the case of a State in which an individual

    (a) Initial Transmittal of Information.--For each individual 
already listed in a contributing agency's records as of the date of 
enactment of this Act, and for whom the agency retains all information 
listed in subparagraphs (A) through (J) of section 3(b)(3), the agency

the agency retains all information listed in subparagraphs (A) through 
(J) of section 3(b)(3), the Agency shall promptly transmit that

SEC. 5. VOTER PROTECTION AND SECURITY IN AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION.

    (a) Protections for Errors in Registration.--An individual shall 
not be prosecuted under any Federal law, or adversely affected in any 
civil adjudication concerning immigration status or naturalization, or 
by an allegation in any legal proceeding that an individual who is not 
a citizen of the United States is removable or inadmissible--
            (1) for notifying an election official of such individual's 
        automatic registration;
            (2) on the grounds that the individual is not an eligible 
        voter and has been automatically registered to vote under this 
        Act; or
            (3) because the individual has been automatically 
        registered to vote at the incorrect address.
    (b) Limits on Use of Automatic Registration.--The automatic 
registration of any individual may not be used as evidence against that 
individual in any State or Federal law enforcement proceeding, and an 
individual's lack of knowledge or willfulness of such registration may 
be demonstrated by the individual's testimony alone.
    (c) Protection of Election Integrity.--Nothing in subsection (a) or 
(b) may be construed to prohibit or restrict any action under color of 
law against an individual who--
            (1) knowingly and willfully makes a false statement to 
        effectuate or perpetuate automatic voter registration by any 
        individual; or
            (2) casts a ballot knowingly and willfully in violation of 
        State law or the laws of the United States.
