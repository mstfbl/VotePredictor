To amend the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 to protect civil 
rights and otherwise prevent meaningful harm to third parties, and for 
                            other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Do No Harm Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should 
        not be interpreted to authorize an exemption from generally 
        applicable law that imposes the religious views, habits, or 
        practices of one party upon another;
            (2) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should 
        not be interpreted to authorize an exemption from generally 
        applicable law that imposes meaningful harm, including 
        dignitary harm, on a third party; and
            (3) the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 should 
        not be interpreted to authorize an exemption that permits 
        discrimination against other persons, including persons who do 
        not belong to the religion or adhere to the beliefs of those to 
        whom the exemption is given.

SEC. 3. EXCEPTION FROM APPLICATION OF ACT WHERE FEDERAL LAW PREVENTS 
              HARM TO OTHERS.

    Section 3 of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 
U.S.C. 2000bb-3) is amended by adding at the end the following:

                    ``(C) protections against child labor, abuse, or 
                exploitation; or
                    ``(D) access to, information about, referrals for, 
                provision of, or coverage for, any health care item or 
                service;
            ``(2) to any term requiring goods, services, functions, or 
        activities to be performed or provided to beneficiaries of a 
        government contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other 
        award; or
            ``(3) to the extent that application would result in 
        denying a person the full and equal enjoyment of a good, 
        service, benefit, facility, privilege, advantage, or 
        accommodation, provided by the government.''.
