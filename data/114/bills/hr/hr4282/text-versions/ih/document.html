Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the 
various departments and agencies of the United States, or of any 
judicial or administrative rule, which provides for recovery of 
attorneys' fees, the term ``prevailing party'' shall include a party

provides any significant part of the relief sought.

eligibility criteria established for prevailing defendants nor alter 
any specific eligibility criteria contained in any statute that 
expressly limits or qualifies who may be considered a prevailing party 
for purposes of that statute.
