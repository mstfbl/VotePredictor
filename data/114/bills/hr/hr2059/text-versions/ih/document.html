                                 A BILL


 
  To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Edwin Cole ``Ed'' Bearss, in 
recognition of his contributions to preservation of American Civil War 
 history and continued efforts to bring our nation's history alive for 
         new generations through his interpretive storytelling.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Edwin Cole ``Ed'' Bearss was born June 26, 1923, in 
        Billings, Montana, to Omar and Virginia Bearss.
            (2) During a 40-year career with the National Park Service, 
        Mr. Bearss distinguished himself as one of America's preeminent 
        historians, particularly in the field of the Civil War, not 
        only through his work to preserve the places in which our 
        nation's history was forged but also through his captivating 
        interpretive storytelling about the people and events that 
        shaped those places.
            (3) His own family traces its genealogy to the Mayflower on 
        his mother's side and to 1636 on his father's side.
            (4) Mr. Bearss' lifelong love affair with the Civil War was 
        kindled during his youth when he read a biography of 
        Confederate cavalry commander J.E.B. Stuart. Even at an early 
        age, Mr. Bearss demonstrated a knack for committing facts to 
        memory, a skill that helped him win school contests in history, 
        current events, and geography.
            (5) He graduated high school in May 1941 and the following 
        year joined the U.S. Marine Corps, serving with the 3rd Marine 
        Raider Battalion during the invasion of Guadalcanal and the 
        Russell Islands. He was badly wounded in gunfire at ``Suicide 
        Creek'', Cape Gloucester, New Britain, while serving with the 
        7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division.
            (6) Upon returning home, Mr. Bearss attended Georgetown 
        University, obtaining a bachelor's degree in Foreign Service 
        studies, and later attended Indiana University, earning a 
        master's degree in history.
            (7) It was during a fortuitous visit to the Shiloh National 
        Military Park in Tennessee, on a tour with the park historian, 
        where the seeds were planted for Mr. Bearss' future career with 
        the National Park Service.
            (8) In 1955, he landed a job as park historian at the 
        National Battlefield Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi, where his 
        research helped fill in missing pieces of Civil War history. 
        None were more significant than the discovery of the U.S.S. 
        Cairo, a long-lost Union ironclad gunboat sunk by Confederate 
        submarine torpedoes in 1862 that was buried in the mud of the 
        Yazoo River. Mr. Bearss later authored a book on the ``sinking 
        and salvage'' of the ironclad.
            (9) It was during his tenure at Shiloh that he met his 
        wife, Margie, a teacher who shared Mr. Bearss' love of history. 
        They had three children, Sara, Cole, and Jenny.
            (10) Mr. Bearss became the National Park Service's chief 
        historian in 1981. Following his retirement in 1994, he was 
        recognized with the title Chief Historian Emeritus, a fitting 
        title as his research and recounting of our nation's history 
        continues to this day.
            (11) He still travels throughout the year to our nation's 
        Civil War battlefields. He once said, ``You can't describe a 
        battlefield unless you walk it.''. Anyone who has spent time 
        with Mr. Bearss touring a battlefield, sometimes braving the 
        elements, enthralled by his prodigious tales regards him as a 
        National Treasure. His unique chronicling of our nation's 
        history has been described as a ``transcendental experience'' 
        of ``Homeric monologues'' punctuated by ``colorful, vivid 
        images''. Mr. Bearss himself has been described as a cross 
        between ``a good-natured platoon sergeant and Walter 
        Cronkite''. He lectures with his eye closed, so he can ``see'' 
        the history better, he once said.
            (12) Mr. Bearss has received multiple honors for his 
        contributions to the preservation of our nation's history: the 
        Harry S. Truman Award in 1961 for Meritorious Service in the 
        field of Civil War history, Man of the Year at Vicksburg in 
        1963, inducted a member of the Company of Military Historians 
        in 1964, the Nevins-Freeman Award from the Chicago Civil War 
        Roundtable in 1980, the Department of the Interior's 
        Distinguished Service Award in 1983, and a commendation from 
        the Secretary of the Army in 1985. The Secretary of the 
        Interior at the time, James Watt, called Mr. Bearss 
        ``unquestionably the most productive historian in the history 
        of the National Park Service''.
            (13) To this day, Mr. Bearss continues to tour the country 
        visiting battlefields and Civil War organizations, keeping 
        America's history fresh in the minds of future generations.
