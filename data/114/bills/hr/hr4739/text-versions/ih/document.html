        plans for the protection and recovery of the Greater Sage 
        Grouse.
    (c) Delay in Making Endangered Species Act of 1973 Finding.--
            (1) Delay required.--In the case of any State with a State 
        management plan, the Secretary of the Interior may not make a 
        finding under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 4(b)(3)(B) 
        of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(B))

    (d) Coordination of Federal Land Management and State Management 
Plans.--
            (1) Prohibition on withdrawals and modifications of federal

        between a State management plan and Federal resource management 
        plans that affect the Greater Sage Grouse, upon notification by 
        the Governor of a State with a State management plan, the 
        Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, as 
        applicable, may not exercise authority under section 204 of the 
        Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714) 
        to make, modify, or extend any withdrawal, nor amend or 
        otherwise modify any Federal resource management plan

        was made, modified, or extended or if any amendment or 
        modification of a Federal resource management plan applicable 
        to Federal lands in the State was issued during the three-year 
        period preceding the date of the notification and the 
        withdrawal, amendment, or modification altered management of 
        the Greater Sage Grouse or its habitat, implementation and 
        operation of the withdrawal, amendment, or modification shall 
        be stayed to the extent that the withdrawal, amendment, or 
        modification is inconsistent with the State management plan. 
        The Federal resource management plan, as in effect immediately 
        before the amendment or modification, shall apply instead with 
        respect to management of the Greater Sage Grouse and its 
        habitat, to the extent consistent with the State management 
        plan.
            (3) Determination of inconsistency.--Any disagreement 
        regarding whether a withdrawal, or an amendment or other 
        modification of a Federal resource management plan, is 
        inconsistent with a State management plan shall be resolved by 
        the Governor of the affected State.
    (e) Relation to National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.--With 
regard to any major Federal action consistent with a State management 
plan, any findings, analyses, or conclusions regarding the Greater Sage 
Grouse or its habitat under section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) shall not have

Representatives a report on the Secretaries' implementation and
