                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide for special 
  procedures for P-2 nonimmigrants who are Canadian citizens, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Entertainment Artists to 
the States (BEATS) Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. SPECIAL RULES FOR P-2 NONIMMIGRANTS WHO ARE CANADIAN CITIZENS.

    Section 214(c)(4)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1184(c)(4)(E)) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
``A petition described in section 101(a)(15)(P)(ii) seeking 
classification of a citizen of Canada as a nonimmigrant under that 
section may be filed in conjunction with an application for admission 
of the citizen of Canada. Such filing may be made with an immigration 
officer at a Class A port of entry located on the United States-Canada 
land border or at a United States pre-clearance station in Canada. The 
petitioning organization is not required to make an appearance (either 
personally or by telecommunication), but the application form shall 
bear the authorized signature of the petitioner. An immigration officer 
at such a port of entry or pre-clearance station may determine 
eligibility of an individual citizen of Canada seeking nonimmigrant 
classification under section 101(a)(15)(P)(ii). If such petition is 
submitted concurrently with an application for admission and lacks 
necessary supporting documentation or is otherwise deficient, the 
inspecting immigration officer shall return it to the applicant for 
admission in order to obtain the necessary documentation from the 
petitioner or for the deficiency to be corrected. Nothing in this 
section may be construed to preclude or discourage the advance filing 
of petitions in accordance with other sections of this Act. After 
admission to the United States, a citizen of Canada admitted pursuant 
to section 101(a)(15)(P)(ii) may, during the period of validity for 
nonimmigrant status under such section and without filing an amended 
petition, (i) alter the dates and venues of performances listed in the 
original petition and (ii) add additional performances or engagements, 
provided that the altered or additional performances or engagements 
constitute no more than one third of the performances or engagements 
listed on the original petition.''.
