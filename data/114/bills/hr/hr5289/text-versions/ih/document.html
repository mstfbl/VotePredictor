                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the energy credit 
         for certain high-efficiency linear generator property.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Tax Fairness Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. ENERGY CREDIT ALLOWED FOR QUALIFIED HIGH-EFFICIENCY LINEAR 
              GENERATOR PROPERTY.

    (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 48(a)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``or'' at the end 
of clause (vi), by adding ``or'' at the end of clause (vii), and by 
adding at the end the following new clause:
                            ``(viii) qualified high-efficiency linear 
                        generator property,''.
    (b) Application of 30-Percent Credit.--Clause (i) of section 
48(a)(2)(A) of such Code is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of 
subclause (III) and by adding at the end the following new subclause:
                                    ``(V) qualified high-efficiency 
                                linear generator property, and''.
    (c) Qualified High-Efficiency Linear Generator Property.--
Subsection (c) of section 48 of such Code is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Qualified high-efficiency linear generator 
        property.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified high-
                efficiency linear generator property' means a 
                stationary linear generator power plant which has--
                            ``(i) a nameplate capacity of less than 
                        2,000 kilowatts, and
                            ``(ii) an electricity-only generation 
                        efficiency of greater than 30 percent.
                    ``(B) Limitations.--In the case of qualified high-
                efficiency linear generator property placed in service 
                during the taxable year, the credit otherwise 
                determined under subsection (a) for such year with 
                respect to such property shall not exceed an amount 
                equal to $1,500 for each 0.5 kilowatt of capacity of 
                such property.
                    ``(C) Stationary linear generator power plant.--The 
                term `stationary linear generator power plant' means an 
                integrated system consisting of translators, cylinders, 
                electricity generating equipment, and associated 
                balance of plant components which converts a fuel or 
                waste heat into electricity for stationary 
                applications. Such term shall include all secondary 
                components located between the existing infrastructure 
                for fuel delivery and the existing infrastructure for 
                power distribution, including equipment and controls 
                for meeting relevant power standards, such as voltage, 
                frequency, and power factors.
            ``(6) Termination.--The term `qualified high-efficiency 
        linear generator property' shall not include any stationary 
        linear generator power plant the construction of which does not 
        begin before January 1, 2022.''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to periods after December 31, 2016, under rules similar to the 
rules of section 48(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as in 
effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the Revenue
