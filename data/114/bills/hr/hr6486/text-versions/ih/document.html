    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Laquan McDonald Camera Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT TO HAVE BODY-WORN CAMERAS AND DASHBOARD CAMERA 
              POLICIES.

    To be in compliance with this section, a State shall require each 
law enforcement agency of that State and of a unit of a local 
government of that State to have in effect a policy requiring and 
prescribing the conditions for the use of body-worn cameras and 
dashboard cameras by law enforcement officers of that agency, and to 
establish procedures providing for the effective enforcement of that 
policy.

SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL FUNDS.

    (a) Covered Programs.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this Act, a grant program 
        is covered by this section if--
                    (A) the program is carried out by or under the 
                authority of the Attorney General; and
                    (B) the program may provide amounts to States for 
                law enforcement purposes.
            (2) List.--For each fiscal year, the Attorney General shall 
        prepare a list identifying each program that meets the criteria 
        of paragraph (1) and provide that list to each State.
    (b) Compliance.--For each fiscal year, any amount that a State 
would otherwise receive for that fiscal year under a grant program 
covered by this section shall be reduced by 10 percent, unless the 
State submits to the Attorney General a certification that each law 
enforcement agency of the State, and of each unit of local government 
of the State, is in full compliance with the requirements of section 2.
    (c) Citizen Suits.--In the case of a State that has submitted a 
certification under subsection (b), if that State has made any 
misrepresentation in that certification pertaining to full compliance 
with the requirements of section 2, a private citizen who is a resident 
of that State may bring an action in a Federal district court to compel 
the Attorney General to take appropriate action under subsection (b). 
The court shall expedite consideration of such an action, and advance 
it on the docket to the maximum extent practicable.
    (d) Redistribution of Amounts.--Amounts under a grant program not 
granted by reason of a reduction under subsection (b), shall be granted 
to one or more entities not subject to such reduction or such 
prohibition, subject to the other laws governing that program.
    (e) Effective Date.--The first grants to which subsection (b) 
applies are grants for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2017.
