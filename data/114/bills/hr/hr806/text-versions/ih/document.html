                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for a land exchange involving a parcel of real property 
under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army on the site of the 
        former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF FACILITIES BY EXCHANGE, MARE ISLAND ARMY 
              RESERVE CENTER, VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Exchange Authorized.--Using the authority available under 
section 18240 of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary of the 
Army may carry out an exchange with Touro University California (in 
this section referred to as the ``University'') under which the 
Secretary will convey all right, title, and interest of the United 
States in and to a parcel of real property, including any improvements 
thereon, consisting of approximately 3.42 acres of the former Mare 
Island Naval Shipyard on Azuar Drive in the City of Vallejo, 
California, and administered by the Secretary as part of the 63rd 
Regional Support Command, for the purpose of permitting the University 
to use the parcel for educational and administrative purposes.
    (b) Facilities To Be Acquired.--In exchange for the conveyance of 
the real property under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Army shall 
acquire, consistent with subsections (c) and (d) of section 18240 of 
title 10, United States Code, a facility, or addition to an existing 
facility, needed to rectify the parking shortage for the Mare Island 
Army Reserve Center.
    (c) Payment of Costs of Conveyance.--
            (1) Payment required.--The Secretary of the Army shall 
        require the University to cover costs (except costs for 
        environmental remediation of the property) to be incurred by 
        the Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for such costs 
        incurred by the Secretary, to carry out the conveyance under 
        subsection (a), including survey costs, costs for environmental 
        documentation related to the conveyance, and any other 
        administrative costs related to the conveyance. If amounts are 
        collected from the University in advance of the Secretary 
        incurring the actual costs, and the amount collected exceeds 
        the costs actually incurred by the Secretary to carry out the 
        conveyance, the Secretary shall refund the excess amount to the 
        University.
            (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received as 
        reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the fund 
        or account that was used to cover those costs incurred by the 
        Secretary in carrying out the conveyance or, if the period of 
        availability for obligations for that appropriation has 
        expired, to the appropriations or fund that is currently 
        available to the Secretary for the same purpose. Amounts so 
        credited shall be merged with amounts in such fund or account, 
        and shall be available for the same purposes, and subject to 
        the same conditions and limitations, as amounts in such fund or 
        account.
    (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal 
description of the property to be conveyed under subsection (a) and 
acquired under subsection (b) shall be determined by a survey 
satisfactory to the Secretary of the Army.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
