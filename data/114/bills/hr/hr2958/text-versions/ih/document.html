    Congress finds as follows:

        Community College by Resolution CN-95-68 as a wholly owned 
        educational entity of the Navajo Nation.
            (3) In 1971, Congress enacted the Navajo Community College 
        Act (Public Law 92-189; 25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.).
            (4) The Navajo Nation officially changed the name of the 
        Navajo Community College to Dine College by Resolution CAP-35-
        97.
            (5) The purpose of Dine College is to provide educational 
        opportunities to the Navajo people and others in areas 
        important to the economic and social development of the Navajo 
        Nation.
            (6) The educational philosophy of Dine College is to apply 
        principles of Sa'ah Naaghai Bik'eh Hozhoon (Dine Philosophy) to

        and heart.
            (7) The United States has a trust and treaty responsibility 
        to the Navajo Nation to provide for the educational 
        opportunities for Navajo people.
            (8) Significant portions of the Dine College's 
        infrastructure are dilapidated and pose a serious health and 
        safety risk to students, employees, and the public.
            (9) This Act is consistent with Executive Order 13592 (76 
        Fed. Reg. 76603, relating to improving American Indian and 
        Alaska Native educational opportunities and strengthening
