        identifying a grid security emergency, the Secretary may, with 
        or without notice, hearing, or report, issue such orders for 
        emergency measures as are necessary in the judgment of the 
        Secretary to protect the reliability of the bulk-power system 
        or of defense critical electric infrastructure during such 
        emergency. As soon as practicable but not later than 180 days

                order for emergency measures issued under paragraph (1) 
                for subsequent periods, not to exceed 30 days for each 
                such period, provided that the President, for each such 
                period, issues and provides to the Secretary a written 
                directive or determination that the grid security 
                emergency identified under paragraph (1) continues to 
                exist or that the emergency measure continues to be

                the extent the owner or operator of defense critical 
                electric infrastructure is required to take emergency 
                measures pursuant to an order issued under this 
                subsection, the owners or operators of a facility or 
                facilities designated by the Secretary pursuant to

        classified information related to a grid security emergency for 
        which emergency measures are issued under paragraph (1) to key 
        personnel of any entity subject to such emergency measures to 
        enable optimum communication between the entity and the 
        Secretary and other appropriate Federal agencies regarding the 
        grid security emergency.
    ``(c) Designation of Critical Defense Facilities.--Not later than 
180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary, in 
consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies and appropriate 
owners, users, or operators of infrastructure that may be defense 
critical electric infrastructure, shall identify and designate 
facilities located in the United States (including the territories) 
that are--
            ``(1) critical to the defense of the United States; and
            ``(2) vulnerable to a disruption of the supply of electric 
        energy provided to such facility by an external provider.
The Secretary may, in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies 
and appropriate owners, users, or operators of defense critical 
electric infrastructure, periodically revise the list of designated 
facilities as necessary.

Federal agencies shall, to the extent practicable and consistent with 
their obligations to protect classified and critical electric 
infrastructure information, share timely actionable information 
regarding grid security with appropriate key personnel of owners, 
operators, and users of the critical electric infrastructure.

        issued under section 202(c) for purposes of such section.
            ``(3) Sharing or receipt of information.--No cause of 
        action shall lie or be maintained in any Federal or State court 
        for the sharing or receipt of information under, and that is
