To direct the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Maritime 
 Administrator, to release all remaining right, title, and interest of 
  the United States in and to a parcel of real property in Richland, 
                   Washington, to the Port of Benton.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Port of Benton Restriction Release 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. RELEASE OF RESTRICTIONS, RICHLAND INNOVATION CENTER, RICHLAND, 
              WASHINGTON.

    (a) Release Authorized.--The Secretary of Transportation, acting 
through the Maritime Administrator and in consultation with the 
Administrator of General Services, may, upon receipt of full 
consideration as provided in subsection (b), release all remaining 
right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel of 
real property, including any improvements thereon, in Richland, 
Washington, consisting as of the date of the enactment of this Act of 
approximately 71.5 acres and containing personal and real property, to 
the Port of Benton (hereafter in this section referred to as the 
``Port'').
    (b) Consideration.--
            (1) Consideration required.--As consideration for the 
        release under subsection (a), the Port shall provide an amount 
        that is acceptable to the Secretary of Transportation, whether 
        by cash payment, in-kind consideration as described under 
        paragraph (2), or a combination thereof, at such time as the 
        Secretary may require. The Secretary may determine the level of 
        acceptable consideration under this paragraph on the basis of 
        the value of the restrictions released under subsection (a), 
        but only if the value of such restrictions is determined 
        without regard to any improvements made by the Port.
            (2) In-kind consideration.--In-kind consideration provided 
        by the Port under paragraph (1) may include the acquisition, 
        construction, provision, improvement, maintenance, repair, or 
        restoration (including environmental restoration), or 
        combination thereof, of any facility or infrastructure under 
        the jurisdiction of any office of the Federal Government.
            (3) Treatment of consideration received.--Consideration in 
        the form of cash payment received by the Secretary under 
        paragraph (1) shall be deposited in the separate fund in the 
        Treasury described in section 572(a)(1) of title 40, United 
        States Code.
    (c) Payment of Cost of Release.--
            (1) Payment required.--The Secretary of Transportation 
        shall require the Port to cover costs to be incurred by the 
        Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for such costs 
        incurred by the Secretary, to carry out the release under 
        subsection (a), including survey costs, costs for environmental 
        documentation related to the release, and any other 
        administrative costs related to the release. If amounts are 
        collected from the Port in advance of the Secretary incurring 
        the actual costs, and the amount collected exceeds the costs 
        actually incurred by the Secretary to carry out the release, 
        the Secretary shall refund the excess amount to the Port.
            (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received as 
        reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the fund 
        or account that was used to cover the costs incurred by the 
        Secretary in carrying out the release under subsection (a) or, 
        if the period of availability of obligations for that 
        appropriation has expired, to the appropriations of fund that 
        is currently available to the Secretary for the same purpose. 
        Amounts so credited shall be merged with amounts in such fund 
        or account and shall be available for the same purposes, and 
        subject to the same conditions and limitations, as amounts in 
        such fund or account.
    (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal 
description of the real property which is the subject of the release 
under subsection (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to 
the Secretary of Transportation.
    (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary of 
Transportation may require such additional terms and conditions in 
connection with the release under subsection (a) as the Secretary, in 
consultation with the Administrator of General Services, considers 
appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
