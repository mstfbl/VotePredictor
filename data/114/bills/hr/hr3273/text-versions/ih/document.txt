        certification that it is necessary to United States national 
        interests to do so; and
            (2) not later than the end of the 5-day period beginning on 
        the date on which such certification is submitted under 
        paragraph (1), there is enacted a joint resolution stating in 
        substance that Congress approves of such certification of the 
        President.
    (c) Computation of Period of Time.--The period of time described in 
subsection (b)(2) shall be computed without regard to--
            (1) the days of which either House of Congress is not in 
        session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day 
        certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die; and
            (2) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under paragraph 
        (1), when either House of the Congress is not in session.
