Sec. 401. Reduction.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution 
        of the United States entrust authority over issues of 
        educational policy to the States and the people and a 
        Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles.
            (2) Tradition and experience dictate that the governance 
        and management of schools in the United States are best 
        performed by parents, teachers, and communities.
            (3) The intrusion by the Department of Education into 
        education policy has not benefitted the quality of education in 
        this Nation.
            (4) The Department of Education has weakened the ability of 
        parents to make essential decisions about their children's 
        education and has undermined the capacity of communities to 
        govern their schools.
            (5) In the 35 years of its existence, the Department of 
        Education has grown from 130 programs and a budget of $14 
        billion to over 230 separately authorized programs which cost 
        nearly $70 billion annually. Meanwhile, education performance 
        has deteriorated.
            (6) The Department of Education has fostered over-
        regulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and litigation 
        in United States education.
            (7) The Department of Education expends large amounts of 
        money on its own maintenance and overhead. As an organization, 
        it is inefficient, ill managed, and wasteful.
            (8) Recent tests reflect poor results in mathematics and 
        reading for American students compared with students from other 
        nations.
            (9) Only through initiatives led by parents and local 
        communities with the power to act can the United States elevate 
        educational performance toward an acceptable level.
            (10) The Department of Education has been hostile to many 
        promising reform ideas.

                      TITLE I--TITLE I PORTABILITY

SEC. 101. TITLE I PORTABILITY.

    Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``SEC. 1128. STATE OPTION TO ALLOW TITLE I FUNDS TO FOLLOW THE LOW-
              INCOME CHILD.

    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and 
to the extent permitted under State law, a State educational agency may 
allocate grant funds received under this part among the local 
educational agencies in the State based on the number of eligible 
children enrolled in the public schools operated by each local 
educational agency and State-accredited private schools within each 
local educational agency's geographic jurisdiction.
    ``(b) Eligible Child.--
            ``(1) Definition.--In this section, the term `eligible 
        child' means a child from a family with an income below the 
        poverty level on the basis of the most recent satisfactory data 
        published by the Department of Commerce.
            ``(2) Criteria of poverty.--In determining the families 
        with incomes below the poverty level for the purposes of this 
        section, a State educational agency shall use the criteria of 
        poverty used by the Census Bureau in compiling the most recent 
        decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by 
        increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, 
        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    ``(c) Student Enrollment in Public and Private Schools.--
            ``(1) Identification of eligible children.--On an annual 
        basis, on a date to be determined by the State educational 
        agency, each local educational agency that receives grant 
        funding in accordance with subsection (a) shall inform the 
        State educational agency of the number of eligible children 
        enrolled in public schools served by the local educational 
        agency and State-accredited private schools within each local 
        educational agency's geographic jurisdiction.
            ``(2) Allocation to local educational agencies.--Based on 
        the identification of eligible children in paragraph (1), the 
        State educational agency shall provide to a local educational 
        agency grant funds the State educational agency received under 
        this part in an amount equal to the sum of the amount available 
        for each eligible child in the State, as determined by the 
        Secretary, multiplied by the number of eligible children 
        identified by the local educational agency under paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Distribution to schools.--Each local educational 
        agency that receives funds under paragraph (2) shall distribute 
        such funds to the public schools served by the local 
        educational agency and State-accredited private schools within 
        each local educational agency's geographic jurisdiction--
                    ``(A) based on the number of eligible children 
                enrolled in such schools; and
                    ``(B) in a manner that would, in the absence of 
                such Federal funds, supplement the funds made available 
                from non-Federal resources for the education of pupils 
                participating in programs under this part, and not to 
                supplant such funds.''.

                        has established a program that meets the 
                        requirements of section 663(c)(11) (whether 
                        statewide or in limited areas of the State) and 
                        that allows a parent of a child described in

                        private funds in accordance with 
                        663(c)(11)(B)(ii), to pay some or all of the 
                        costs of attendance at a private school--

                                the State's obligation under paragraph 
                                (1) with respect to the child during 
                                the period in which the child is
