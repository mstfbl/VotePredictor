SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) Tunisia has been a critical ally of the United States 
        for more than 200 years, dating back to 1797 when the Treaty of 
        Peace and Friendship was signed, ensuring the safety and 
        availability of open sea lanes in the Mediterranean Sea.
            (2) On December 10, 2010, the self-immolation of Tunisian 
        fruit vendor, Mohammed Bouazizi, inspired popular revolutions 
        across the region leading to political transitions in four 
        countries, often referred to as the ``Arab Spring'', and 
        initiating Tunisia's transition to democracy.
            (3) In 2014, Tunisia became the first country with a 
        majority Muslim population in the Middle East or North Africa 
        to experience both Presidential and parliamentary political 
        transitions through free and fair democratic elections.
            (4) Since 2011, more than 3,000 Tunisian citizens have gone

        (ISIS).

        surrounding areas.
            (7) The terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia (AAS) was founded 
        in April 2011 in Tunisia and is ideologically aligned with Al-
        Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) and ISIS. AAS is responsible for 
        the assassinations of Tunisian MP Mohamed Brahimi on July 25, 
        2013, and secular-democratic political activist Chokri Belaid 
        on February 6, 2013.
            (8) On September 14, 2012, Ansar al-Sharia terrorists 
        attacked the United States Embassy compound, annex, and school 
        in Tunis, Tunisia, causing millions of dollars in damages.
            (9) On January 10, 2014, Ansar al-Sharia was designated as 
        a foreign terrorist organization by the United States.
            (10) On March 18, 2015, 18 people were killed in a 
        terrorist attack at the Bardo National Museum in Tunis, 
        Tunisia.
            (11) On June 27, 2015, at least 39 people were killed and 
        36 injured in a terrorist attack on the beach of a hotel resort 
        in Sousse, Tunisia. The gunmen had received training and 
        support from ISIS in Libya.
            (12) On May 21, 2015, Tunisia was designated as a major 
        non-NATO ally of the United States.
            (13) On September 29, 2015, Tunisia joined the United 
        States-led coalition to counter ISIS.
            (14) On November 24, 2015, ISIS militants conducted a bus 
        bombing, targeting the Tunisian Presidential guard and killing 
        12 people in Tunis, Tunisia.

        exclusion under the Ben Ali period but more reforms are needed 
        to solidify Tunisia's economic stability; and
