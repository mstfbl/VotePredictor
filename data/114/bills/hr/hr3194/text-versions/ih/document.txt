                                 A BILL


 
        To protect and promote international religious freedom.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Further Independence of Religion for 
Security and Tolerance Freedom Act of 2015'' or the ``FIRST Freedom 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Many of our Nation's founders fled religious 
        persecution and placed great importance on religious freedom. 
        President George Washington summed up the prevailing view of 
        our founders when he wrote, in 1793, ``in this Land of equal 
        liberty it is our boast, that a man's religious tenets will not 
        forfeit the protection of the Laws''.
            (2) In 1791, the First Amendment to the Constitution was 
        ratified, enshrining freedom of religion as the ``First 
        Freedom'' of all Americans and becoming an inspiration to 
        people all over the world who struggle to throw off the yoke of 
        religious persecution.
            (3) Throughout our Nation's history, the United States has 
        sought to protect and promote fundamental human rights, 
        including religious freedom, in the United States and 
        throughout the world.
            (4) After World War II, under Eleanor Roosevelt's 
        leadership, the United States spearheaded the ratification of 
        the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted at Paris 
        December 10, 1948, which recognized freedom of religion as a 
        fundamental right of all people. Article 18 of that treaty 
        states ``Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, 
        conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change 
        his religion or belief, and freedom either alone or in 
        community with others and in public or private, to manifest his 
        religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and 
        observance.''.
            (5) The International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights, adopted at New York December 16, 1966, and which was 
        ratified by the United States in 1992, states, ``Everyone shall 
        have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. 
        This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion 
        or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in 
        community with others and in public or private, to manifest his 
        religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and 
        teaching.''.
            (6) Since the enactment of the International Religious 
        Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-292), referred to in this 
        section as ``IRFA'', which established the Department of 
        State's Office on International Religious Freedom, the 
        Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, and 
        the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom 
        (referred to in this section as ``USCIRF''), the state of 
        religious freedom throughout the world has significantly 
        worsened.
            (7) In section 2(a)(4) of IRFA (2 U.S.C. 6401(a)(4)), 
        Congress stated, ``More than one-half of the world's population 
        lives under regimes that severely restrict or prohibit the 
        freedom of their citizens to study, believe, observe, and 
        freely practice the religious faith of their choice.''.
            (8) According to ``Rising Tide of Restrictions on 
        Religion,'' the most recent report of the Pew Research Center's 
        Forum on Religion & Public Life, three-quarters of the world's 
        population lives in countries in which restrictions on religion 
        were high or very high.
            (9) According to the 2014 USCIRF Annual Report, ``The past 
        10 years have seen a worsening of the already-poor religious 
        freedom environment in Pakistan, a continued dearth of 
        religious freedom in Turkmenistan, backsliding in Vietnam, 
        rising violations in Egypt before and after the Arab Spring, 
        and Syria's decent [sic] into sectarian civil war with all 
        sides perpetrating egregious religious freedom violations.''.
            (10) Under section 402 of IRFA (22 U.S.C. 6442), the 
        President is required to designate a country as a country of 
        particular concern (referred to in this section as ``CPC'') if 
        the government of the country has engaged in or tolerated 
        systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of religious 
        freedom.
            (11) According to the 2015 USCIRF Annual Report, since 
        October 1999, when the first countries were designated as CPCs, 
        ``the list has been largely unchanged. Of the nine countries 
        designated as CPCs in July 2014, most had been named as CPCs 
        for over a decade . . . Since IRFA's inception, only one 
        country has been removed from the State Department's CPC list 
        due to diplomatic activity.''. This track record calls into 
        serious question the utility of the CPC mechanism and the 
        utility of IRFA to improve the state of religious freedom 
        throughout the world.
            (12) The United States has a long tradition of providing 
        safe haven to refugees, including members of religious minority 
        groups and those fleeing religious persecution. Following the 
        international community's tragic failure to shelter Jewish 
        refugees fleeing the Nazi genocide, the United States played a 
        leadership role in establishing the international legal regime 
        for the protection of refugees. Since that time, the American 
        people have generously welcomed millions of refugees fleeing 
        war and totalitarian regimes, and the United States 
        traditionally accepts at least 50 percent of resettlement cases 
        handled by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
        for Refugees (referred to in this section as ``UNHCR'').
            (13) According to the 2014 UNHCR Global Trends Report, more 
        than 59,500,000 people were forcibly displaced in 2014--
                    (A) which is equal to 1 displacement for every 122 
                people worldwide;
                    (B) which is the most displacements in a year in 
                recorded history;
                    (C) including--
                            (i) 38,200,000 individuals who were 
                        internally displaced within their own country;
                            (ii) 19,500,000 refugees; and
                            (iii) 1,800,000 asylum-seekers;
                    (D) many of whom were victims of serious human 
                rights violations, including religious persecution; and
                    (E) many are whom are members of vulnerable 
                populations, including religious minorities.
            (14) The ongoing conflict in Syria has led to the world's 
        worst ongoing humanitarian crisis and worst refugee crisis 
        since World War II. More than 50 percent of Syria's 23,000,000 
        people have been forcibly displaced from their homes and, as of 
        2015, 20 percent of the world's refugees are Syrians. UNHCR is 
        seeking to resettle 130,000 Syrian refugees during 2015 and 
        2016, with a particular focus on vulnerable individuals such as 
        religious minorities. Although the United States traditionally 
        accepts at least 50 percent of UNHCR resettlement cases, the 
        United States has only accepted approximately 800 Syrian 
        refugees since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, which is 
        an unacceptably low number.
            (15) There are several steps that would facilitate the 
        efforts of the United States Government to protect and provide 
        safe haven to refugees from religious persecution. The 2015 
        USCIRF Annual Report recommends that Congress ``work to provide 
        the President with permanent authority to designate as refugees 
        specifically-defined groups based on shared characteristics 
        identifying them as targets for persecution on account of race, 
        religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, 
        or political opinion''.
            (16) The United States Government has limited tools to hold 
        accountable the perpetrators of religious freedom violations. 
        Section 604 of IRFA added section 212(a)(2)(G) of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)), which 
        made foreign government officials who commit particularly 
        severe violations of religious freedom inadmissible to the 
        United States, but it has only been applied once, to deny entry 
        to Narendra Modi, who was Chief Minister of Gujarat, India. In 
        its 2015 Annual Report, USCIRF recommends that the State 
        Department: ``Make greater efforts to ensure foreign government 
        officials are denied entry into the United States due to their 
        inadmissibility under U.S. law for their responsibility for 
        religious freedom violations abroad.''. The effectiveness of 
        this law is also limited because it does not apply to non-state 
        actors, such as international terrorists, and it can only be 
        used to deny entry to a perpetrator who has not yet arrived in 
        the United States, not to deport a perpetrator who has already 
        entered the country.
            (17) In the 2015 USCIRF Annual Report, USCIRF recommended 
        that the United States Government ``should call for or support 
        a referral by the UN Security Council to the International 
        Criminal Court to investigate ISIL violations in Iraq and Syria 
        against religious and ethnic minorities, following the models 
        used in Sudan and Libya, or encourage the Iraqi government to 
        accept ICC jurisdiction to investigate ISIL violations in Iraq 
        after June 2014''. Given the weakness of the international 
        criminal justice system, particularly that an ICC referral is 
        subject to a UN Security Council veto, the United States 
        Government should have the ability to prosecute members of ISIL 
        in United States courts for crimes against humanity, including 
        religious persecution.
            (18) Under United States law, it is a crime for a non-
        United States national to commit genocide, torture, terrorism, 
        or several other violations of the law of nations, but it is 
        not a crime under United States law to commit crimes against 
        humanity, including religious persecution. Since the United 
        States Government is unable to prosecute perpetrators of these 
        crimes, many foreign war criminals have found safe haven in 
        this country.
            (19) In 2006, the United States Government learned that 
        Marko Boskic, a man who participated in the Srebrenica massacre 
        in the Bosnian conflict, was living in Massachusetts. Rather 
        than charging him with crimes against humanity, or religious 
        persecution, Mr. Boskic was charged with visa fraud and 
        sentenced to only 5 years in prison.
            (20) There is bipartisan agreement about the need for the 
        United States Government to promote and protect international 
        human rights, including religious freedom. USCIRF is, by 
        design, a bipartisan organization, with Commissioners appointed 
        by the President and Congressional leaders. USCIRF can most 
        effectively promote religious freedom on a bipartisan basis.
            (21) In its 2014 Annual Report entitled ``Additional 
        Opportunities to Reduce Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication 
        and Achieve Other Financial Benefits'', which identifies 
        unnecessary duplication in the Federal Government, the 
        Government Accountability Office (referred to in this section 
        as ``GAO'')--
                    (A) highlighted the lack of coordination and 
                overlapping missions of USCIRF and the Office of 
                International Religious Freedom in the Department of 
                State;
                    (B) found that ``the lack of a definition regarding 
                how State and the Commission are to interact has 
                sometimes created foreign policy tensions that State 
                has had to mitigate.''; and
                    (C) concluded that the lack of coordination between 
                the USCIRF and the Department of State may undermine 
                the efforts of the United States Government to promote 
                international religious freedom by sending mixed 
                messages to foreign governments and human-rights 
                activists who are fighting to defend religious freedom 
                in their countries.
            (22) Congress, which is responsible for overseeing the work 
        of USCIRF and ensuring that it is effectively pursuing its 
        mission, should provide greater oversight of USCIRF's 
        practices, including addressing concerns regarding financial 
        irregularities and the work environment for religious 
        minorities.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the protection and promotion of international human 
        rights, including religious freedom, should be an important 
        priority for the United States Government; and
            (2) the United States Government should pursue new 
        strategies for protecting and promoting religious freedom 
        throughout the world, including--
                    (A) the creation of new tools--
                            (i) to deter and punish the perpetrators of 
                        particularly severe violations of religious 
                        freedom, including non-state actors; and
                            (ii) to protect the victims of such 
                        violations; and
                    (B) increased diplomatic engagement that does not 
                focus primarily on CPC designations.

SEC. 3. ENHANCED PROTECTIONS FOR REFUGEES AND ASYLEES FLEEING RELIGIOUS 
              PERSECUTION.

    (a) Authority To Designate Certain Groups of Refugees for 
Consideration.--Section 207(c)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1157(c)(1)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``Subject to the numerical 
        limitations''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(B)(i) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security, may designate specifically 
        defined groups of aliens--
                    ``(I) whose resettlement in the United States is 
                justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in 
                the national interest; and
                    ``(II) who--
                            ``(aa) share common characteristics that 
                        identify them as targets of persecution on 
                        account of race, religion, nationality, 
                        membership in a particular social group, or 
                        political opinion; or
                            ``(bb) having been identified as targets 
                        under item (aa), share a common need for 
                        resettlement due to a specific vulnerability.
            ``(ii) An alien who establishes membership in a group 
        designated under clause (i) to the satisfaction of the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security shall be considered a refugee 
        for purposes of admission as a refugee under this section 
        unless the Secretary of State determines that such alien 
        ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the 
        persecution of any person on account of race, religion, 
        nationality, membership in a particular social group, or 
        political opinion.
            ``(iii) A designation under clause (i) is for purposes of 
        adjudicatory efficiency and may be revoked by the Secretary of 
        State at any time after notification to Congress.

        8 U.S.C. 1157 note)--
                    ``(I) shall be designated under clause (i) until 
                the end of the first fiscal year commencing after the

                    ``(II) shall be eligible for designation thereafter

                under consideration has been designated as a country of 
                particular concern under section 402 of International 
                Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442) for 
                engaging in or tolerating systematic, ongoing, and 
                egregious violations of religious freedom.
            ``(v) A designation under clause (i) shall not influence 
        decisions to grant, to any alien, asylum under section 208,

    (b) Time Limits for Filing for Asylum.--Section 208(a)(2) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``or the Secretary of 
        Homeland Security'' after ``Attorney General'' both places such 
        term appears;
