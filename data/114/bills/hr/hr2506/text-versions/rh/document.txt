                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to delay the authority 
   to terminate Medicare Advantage contracts for MA plans failing to 
                    achieve minimum quality ratings.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Seniors' Health Care Plan Protection 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. DELAY IN AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS FOR MEDICARE 
              ADVANTAGE PLANS FAILING TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM QUALITY 
              RATINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Consistent with the studies provided under the 
IMPACT Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-185), it is the intent of Congress--
            (1) to continue to study and request input on the effects 
        of socioeconomic status and dual-eligible populations on the 
        Medicare Advantage STARS rating system before reforming such 
        system with the input of stakeholders; and
            (2) pending the results of such studies and input, to 
        provide for a temporary delay in authority of the Centers for 
        Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to terminate Medicare 
        Advantage plan contracts solely on the basis of performance of 
        plans under the STARS rating system.
    (b) Delay in MA Contract Termination Authority for Plans Failing To 
Achieve Minimum Quality Ratings.--Section 1857(h) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(h)) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) Delay in contract termination authority for plans 
        failing to achieve minimum quality rating.--The Secretary may 
        not terminate a contract under this section with respect to the 
        offering of an MA plan by a Medicare Advantage organization 
        solely because the MA plan has failed to achieve a minimum 
        quality rating under the 5-star rating system established under 
        section 1853(o) during the period beginning on the date of the 
        enactment of this paragraph and through the end of plan year 
        2018.''.
