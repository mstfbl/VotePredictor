                product traceability documentation.

        of information.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1),

                distributor, or retailer (including a restaurant) may,

                inspections of--
                            (i) seafood; or
                            (ii) any facility that processes or sells

        implemented under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (b) Refusal of Admission.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), all 
        seafood imported or offered for import originating from an 
        exporter shall be refused admission if--
                    (A) the Secretary of Commerce finds that any 
                shipment of such seafood appears to be in violation of 
                subsection (a); or

        shall determine whether to require, as a condition of granting 
        admission into the United States to an article of seafood 
        originating from such exporter, that such seafood be 
        accompanied by a certification or other assurance under section 
        801(q) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
        381(q)).
            (3) Allowance of individual shipments.--Paragraph (1) does 
        not apply with respect to an individual shipment of seafood 
        originating from an exporter whose products must otherwise be 
        refused admission under such paragraph if the exporter presents 
        evidence to the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the 
        Secretary of Commerce from a laboratory accredited under 
        section 422 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
        U.S.C. 350k), or other equivalent evidence, documenting that 
        the shipment is in compliance with the provisions of subsection 
        (a) and other applicable Federal laws or regulations 
        prohibiting seafood fraud.
            (4) Termination of individual shipment screening 
        requirement.--Paragraph (1) shall cease to prohibit the 
        admission of seafood originating from an exporter based on a 
        prior shipment if the Secretary of Health and Human Services or 
        the Secretary of Commerce determines that--
                    (A) each prior shipment whose appearance triggered 
                the application of such paragraph was in fact in 
                compliance with the provisions of subsection (a) and 
                other applicable Federal laws or regulations, including 
                those prohibiting seafood fraud; or
                    (B) during the preceding 12 months, no shipment of 
                seafood originating from the exporter has triggered the 
                application of paragraph (1).
    (c) Penalties.--The Secretary of Commerce shall prevent any person 
from violating this Act, or any Act to which this section applies, in 
the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
powers, and duties as though sections 308 through 311 of the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1858 through 
1861) were incorporated into and made a part of and applicable to this 
Act.
    (d) List of Offenders.--The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop, 
maintain, and post on the public website of the Department of Commerce 
a list that--
            (1) includes, by country, each exporter whose seafood is 
        imported or offered for import into the United States; and
            (2) for each such exporter, tracks the timing, type, and 
        frequency of violations of Federal law relating to seafood 
        fraud.
    (e) Inspections.--The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall--
            (1) increase, as resources allow, the number of foreign and 
        domestic seafood shipments that are inspected for seafood fraud 
        by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration inspectors 
        and authorized officers, including verification of compliance 
        with the traceability requirements of subsection (a);
            (2) ensure that the percentage of seafood shipments 
        inspected during a given year is not lower than the percentage 
        inspected during the previous year; and
            (3) to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that 
        inspections and tests for seafood fraud prevention also collect 
        information to support the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services in implementing the seafood safety requirements of the 
        FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (Public Law 111-353).
    (f) Impact on Existing Food Safety Authority.--Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to execute or enforce food safety laws or 
regulations that may be adopted pursuant to the FDA Food Safety 
Modernization Act (Public Law 111-353).

SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OF STATES.

    Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency 
designated by a State, has reason to believe that any person has 
engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of seafood fraud in 
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of section 3, the State may bring a 
civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin fraud, an action to 
recover for actual monetary loss or receive $10,000 in damages for each 
violation, or both such actions. If the court finds the defendant 
willfully or knowingly violated this Act, the court may, in its 
discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not 
more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding sentence. 
Nothing in this section shall preclude an individual from bringing a 
civil action.

and enforce requirements for improving seafood safety and preventing 
seafood fraud that are consistent with the requirements of this Act.
