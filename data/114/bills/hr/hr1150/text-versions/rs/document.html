                                 AN ACT


 
To amend the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to improve the 
  ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally 
  through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign 
 assistance efforts, and through stronger and more flexible political 
    responses to religious freedom violations and violent extremism 
                   worldwide, and for other purposes.

        abroad, and advances United States interests in stability, 
        security, and development globally, the promotion of 
        international religious freedom requires new and evolving 
        policies, and diplomatic responses that are drawn from the 
        expertise of the national security agencies, the diplomatic 
        services, and other governmental agencies and nongovernmental

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in subparagraph (B)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

              AMBASSADOR AT LARGE FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS 
              FREEDOM.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Section 101 of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6411) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end before 
        the period the following: ``, and shall report directly to the 
        Secretary of State'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in subsection (c)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in paragraph (1)--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) by striking ``responsibility''

                paragraph (5); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) by inserting after paragraph (3) the 
                following new paragraph:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(4) Coordination responsibilities.--In order to 
        promote religious freedom as an interest of United States 
        foreign policy, the Ambassador at Large--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) shall coordinate international 
                religious freedom policies across all programs, 
                projects, and activities of the United States;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) should participate in any 
                interagency processes on issues in which the promotion 
                of international religious freedom policy can advance 
                United States national security interests, including in 
                democracy promotion, stability, security, and 
                development globally.''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) in subsection (d), by striking ``staff for the 
        Office'' and all that follows through the period at the end and 
        inserting ``individuals to fill at least 25 full-time 
        equivalent staff positions, and any other temporary staff 
        positions as needed to compile, edit, and manage the Annual 
        Report under the direct supervision of the Ambassador at Large, 
        and for the conduct of investigations by the Office and for 
        necessary travel to carry out the provisions of this Act. The 
        Secretary of State should also provide to the Ambassador at 
        Large funds that are sufficient to carry out the duties 
        described in this section, including as necessary 
        representation funds, in amounts comparable to those provided 
        to other Ambassadors at Large in the Department of 
        State.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--Because international religious 
freedom is a vital foreign policy interest and one that needs 
coordination across many regional bureaus and among Special Envoys and 
Special Representatives with overlapping mandates, the Secretary of 
State should consider elevating the office of International Religious 
Freedom and the position of the Ambassador at Large for International 
Religious Freedom to the Office of the Secretary, similar to other 
Ambassador at Large positions that now report directly to the 
Secretary. Providing the Office of International Religious Freedom with 
additional resources and status will demonstrate both the strategic 
importance of international religious freedom policy within the State 
Department bureaucracy and show persecuted religious groups globally 
that the United States gives priority to the protection and promotion 
of international religious freedom as mandated by the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        the criteria described in section 3(11) for 
                        designation under section 
                        402(b)(1).''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the original intent of the International 
        Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to 
        require annual reports from both the Department of State and 
        the Commission on International Religious Freedom to be 
        delivered each year, during the same calendar year, and with at 
        least 5 months separating these reports, in order to provide 
        updated information for policy-makers, Members of Congress, and 
        nongovernmental organizations; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human 
        Rights Practices no longer contain updated information on 
        religious freedom conditions globally, it is important that the 
        Department of State and the Commission work together to fulfill 
        the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act 
        of 1998.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        striking ``The Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Child

        religious freedom, how violations of international religious 
        freedom harm fundamental United States interests, how the 
        advancement of international religious freedom can advance such 
        interests, how United States international religious freedom 
        policy should be carried out in practice by United States 
        diplomats and other Foreign Service officers, and the relevance 
        and relationship of international religious freedom to United 
        States defense, diplomacy, development, and public affairs 
        efforts. The Secretary of State shall ensure the availability 
        of sufficient resources to develop and implement such

              CONCERNS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 108 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 
1998 (22 U.S.C. 6417) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        country of particular concern for religious freedom under 
        section 402(b)(1) or by a non-state actor that the Commission

         &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE II--NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 201. SPECIAL ADVISER FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS 
              FREEDOM.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 101 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
U.S.C. 3021) is amended by striking subsection (k) and inserting the 
following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(k) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
there should be within the staff of the National Security Council a 
Special Adviser to the President on International Religious Freedom, 
whose position should be comparable to that of a director within the 
Executive Office of the President, with the primary responsibility to 
serve as a resource for executive branch officials on international 
religious freedom, compiling and maintaining information on the facts 
and circumstances of violations of religious freedom (as defined in 
section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998), and 
making relevant policy recommendations to advance United States 
international religious freedom policy. The Special Advisor should also 
assist the Ambassador at Large to coordinate international religious 
freedom policies and strategies throughout the executive branch and 
within any interagency policy committees where the Ambassador at Large 
participates.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

           &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE III--PRESIDENTIAL ACTIONS&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 301. NON-STATE ACTOR DESIGNATIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The President shall, concurrent with the 
annual foreign country review required by section 402(b)(1) of the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1))--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) review and identify any non-state actors 
        operating in any such reviewed country or surrounding region 
        that have engaged in particularly severe violations of

        Act, each such non-state actor as an entity of particular 
        concern for religious freedom.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Report.--Whenever the President designates a non-state 
actor under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for 
religious freedom, the President shall, as soon as practicable after 
the designation is made, submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a report detailing the reasons for such 
designation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Actions.--The President should take specific actions 
to address severe violations of religious freedom of non-state actors 
that are designated under subsection (a), including taking actions 
commensurate to those actions described in section 405 of the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Department of State Annual Report.--The Secretary of 
State should include information detailing the reasons the President 
designated a non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for 
religious freedom under subsection (a) in the Annual Report required in

(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of State should work with Congress to create new 
political, financial, and diplomatic tools to address severe violations 
of religious freedom by non-state actors and to update the actions the 
President can take in section 405 of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Determinations of Responsible Parties.--In order to 
appropriately target Presidential actions under the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 in response, the President shall with 
respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of particular 
concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), seek to determine 
the specific officials or members thereof that are responsible for the 
particularly severe violations of religious freedom engaged in or 
tolerated by that entity.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (g) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``appropriate 
congressional committees'', ``non-state actor'', and ``particularly 
severe violations of religious freedom'' have the meanings given such 
terms in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6402), as amended by section 3 of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        to read as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 90 days

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by striking ``that--'' and all that follows 
        and inserting ``that the exercise of such waiver authority 
        would further the purposes of this Act.'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection 
        (c);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) by inserting after subsection (a) the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Additional Authority.--Subject to subsection (c),

        is a compelling interest of United States foreign policy, the 
        President, the Secretary of State, and other Executive branch

        ways to address existing violations, on a case-by-case basis, 
        through the actions specified in section 405 or other 
        commensurate action in substitution thereto.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 305. PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 408(a)(1) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6448(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following: ``Any designation of a non-state actor as an entity of 
particular concern for religious freedom under section 301 of the Frank 
R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act, together with, when 
applicable and to the extent practicable, the identities of individuals 
determined to be responsible for the violations under subsection (e) of 
such section.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

      &lt;DELETED&gt;TITLE IV--PROMOTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 401. ASSISTANCE FOR PROMOTING RELIGIOUS 
              FREEDOM.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Availability of Assistance.--It is the sense of 
Congress that for each fiscal year that begins on or after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Department of State should make 
available--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) an amount equal to not less than 10 percent of 
        the amounts available in that fiscal year for the Human Rights 
        and Democracy Fund for the promotion of international religious 
        freedom and for projects to advance United States interests in 
        the protection and advancement of international religious 
        freedom, in particular, through grants to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) groups that are able to develop legal 
                protections or promote cultural and societal 
                understanding of international norms of religious 
                freedom;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) groups that seek to address and 
                mitigate religiously motivated and sectarian violence 
                and combat violent extremism; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) groups that seek to strengthen 
                investigations, reporting, and monitoring of religious 
                freedom violations; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) an amount equal to not less than 2 percent of 
        amounts available in that fiscal year for the Human Rights and 
        Democracy Fund to be made available for the establishment of a 
        Religious Freedom Defense Fund, administered by the Ambassador 
        at Large for International Religious Freedom, to provide grants 
        for--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) victims of religious freedom abuses 
                and their families to cover legal and other expenses 
                that may arise from detention, imprisonment, torture, 
                fines, and other restrictions; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) projects to help create and support 
                training of a new generation of defenders of religious 
                freedom, including legal and political advocates, and 
                civil society projects which seek to create advocacy 
                networks, strengthen legal representation, train and 
                educate new religious freedom defenders, and build the 
                capacity of religious communities and rights defenders 
                to protect against religious freedom violations, 
                mitigate societal or sectarian violence, or minimize 
                legal or other restrictions of the right to freedom of 
                religion.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Preference.--It is the sense of Congress that, in 
providing grants under subsection (a), the Ambassador at Large for 
International Religious Freedom should, as appropriate, give preference 
to projects targeting religious freedom violations in countries 
designated as countries of particular concern for religious freedom 
under section 402(b)(1) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 
1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)) and countries included on the Special Watch 
List described in section 102(b)(1)(F)(iii) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)(F)(iii)).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Administration and Consultations.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Administration.--Amounts made available in 
        accordance with subsection (a) shall be administered by the 
        Ambassador at Large for International Religious 
        Freedom.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Consultations.--In developing priorities and 
        policies for providing grants in accordance with subsection 
        (a), including priorities and policies for identification of 
        potential grantees, the Ambassador at Large for International 
        Religious Freedom shall consult with other Federal agencies, 
        including the United States Commission on International 
        Religious Freedom and, as appropriate, nongovernmental 
        organizations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) by redesignating section 605 as section 606; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by inserting after section 604 the following

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Title VII of the International Religious Freedom Act of 
1998 (22 U.S.C. 6481 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new sections:&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;``SEC. 702. VOLUNTARY CODES OF CONDUCT FOR UNITED STATES 
              INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE UNITED 
              STATES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Finding.--Congress recognizes the enduring 
importance of United States institutions of higher education worldwide 
both for their potential for shaping positive leadership and new 
educational models in host countries and for their emphasis on teaching 
universally recognized rights of free inquiry and academic 
freedom.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
United States institutions of higher education operating campuses 
outside the United States or establishing any educational entities with 
foreign governments, particularly with or in countries the governments 
of which engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom 
as identified in the Annual Report, should seek to adopt a voluntary 
code of conduct for operating in such countries that should--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        their employees and students, including the right to manifest 
        that religion peacefully as protected in international

        of the President required by section 108 of the National 
        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) should promote 
        international religious freedom as a foreign policy and 
        national security priority and should articulate that promotion 
        of the right to freedom of religion is a strategy that protects 
        other, related human rights, and advances democracy outside the 
        United States, and make clear its importance to United States 
        foreign policy goals of stability, security, development, and 
        diplomacy; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

    (a) Findings.--Section 2(a) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``The freedom of 
        thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect 
        theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess 
        or practice any religion.'' before ``Governments'';
            (2) in paragraph (4), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``A policy or practice of routinely denying applications for 
        visas for religious workers in a country can be indicative of a 
        poor state of religious freedom in that country.''; and
            (3) in paragraph (6)--
                    (A) by inserting ``and the specific targeting of 
                non-theists, humanists, and atheists because of their 
                beliefs'' after ``religious persecution''; and
                    (B) by inserting ``and in regions where non-state 
                actors exercise significant political power and 
                territorial control'' before the period at the end.
    (b) Policy.--Section 2(b) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401(b)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as 
        subparagraphs (A) through (E);
            (2) by striking the matter preceding subparagraph (A), as 
        redesignated, and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In general.--The following shall be the policy of the 
        United States:''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Evolving policies and coordinated diplomatic 
        responses.--Because the promotion of international religious 
        freedom protects human rights, advances democracy abroad, and 
        advances United States interests in stability, security, and 
        development globally, the promotion of international religious 
        freedom requires new and evolving policies and diplomatic 
        responses that--
                    ``(A) are drawn from the expertise of the national 
                security agencies, the diplomatic services, and other 
                governmental agencies and nongovernmental 
                organizations; and

                entire range of Federal agencies.''.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a policy or practice by the government of any foreign 
        country of routinely denying visa applications for religious 
        workers can be indicative of a poor state of religious freedom 
        in that country; and
            (2) the United States Government should seek to reverse any 
        such policy by reviewing the entirety of the bilateral 
        relationship between such country and the United States.

        and all that follows and inserting ``adequate staff for the 
        Office, including full-time equivalent positions and any other 
        temporary staff positions needed to compile, edit, and manage

        Ambassador at Large, and for the conduct of investigations by

        date on which the President's annual budget request is

        and
            (2) maintaining an adequate staffing level at the Office, 
        such as was in place during fiscal year 2016, is necessary for 
        the Office to carry on its vital work.

                country,'' after ``such groups,'';

        United States actions and'' and inserting ``A detailed 
        description of United States actions, diplomatic and political 
        coordination efforts, and other''; and

                Religious Freedom Act is located shall be included in 
                this section of the report.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the original intent of the International Religious 
        Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) was to require 
        annual reports from both the Department of State and the 
        Commission on International Religious Freedom to be delivered 
        each year, during the same calendar year, and with at least 5 
        months separating these reports, in order to provide updated 
        information for policymakers, Members of Congress, and 
        nongovernmental organizations; and
            (2) given that the annual Country Reports on Human Rights 
        Practices no longer contain updated information on religious 
        freedom conditions globally, it is important that the 
        Department of State coordinate with the Commission to fulfill 
        the original intent of the International Religious Freedom Act 
        of 1998.

        Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Refugees.--The Secretary 
        of State''; and
            (5) in subsection (f), as redesignated, by striking ``The 
        Secretary of State'' and inserting ``Child Soldiers.--The 
        Secretary of State''.

U.S.C. 6417) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``faith,'' and inserting 
        ``activities, religious freedom advocacy, or efforts to protect

country review required under section 402(b)(1)(A) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)), shall--
            (1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in 
        any such reviewed country or surrounding region that have 
        engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; 
        and
            (2) designate, in a manner consistent with such Act, each 
        such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for 
        religious freedom.
    (b) Report.--Whenever the President designates a non-state actor 
under subsection (a) as an entity of particular concern for religious 
freedom, the President, as soon as practicable after the designation is 
made, shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees 
that describes the reasons for such designation.

practicable, to address severe violations of religious freedom of non-
state actors that are designated under subsection (a)(2).

1998 (22 U.S.C. 6412(b)(1)).
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--

        the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom--
                    (A) to create new political, financial, and 
                diplomatic tools to address severe violations of 
                religious freedom by non-state actors; and
                    (B) to update the actions the President can take 
                under section 405 of the International Religious 
                Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6445);
            (2) governments must ultimately be held accountable for the 
        abuses that occur in their territories; and
            (3) any actions the President takes after designating a 
        non-state actor as an entity of particular concern should also 
        involve high-level diplomacy with the government of the country 
        in which the non-state actor is operating.
    (f) Determinations of Responsible Parties.--In order to 
appropriately target Presidential actions under the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.), the President, 
with respect to each non-state actor designated as an entity of 
particular concern for religious freedom under subsection (a), shall 
seek to determine the specific officials or members that are 
responsible for the particularly severe violations of religious freedom 
engaged in or tolerated by such non-state actor.
    (g) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``appropriate 
congressional committees'', ``non-state actor'', and ``particularly 
severe violations of religious freedom'' have the meanings given such 
terms in section 3 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6402), as amended by section 3 of this Act.

                motivated and sectarian violence and combat violent 
                extremism; or

                other restrictions; and
                    (B) projects to help create and support training of 
                a new generation of defenders of religious freedom, 
                including legal and political advocates, and civil 
                society projects which seek to create advocacy 
                networks, strengthen legal representation, train and

                capacity of religious communities and rights defenders
