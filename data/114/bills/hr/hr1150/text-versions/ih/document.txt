SEC. 2. FINDINGS; POLICY.

    Section 2 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6401) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (4), in the fourth sentence, by 
                inserting ``prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter, 
                male infant circumcision, censorship of religious 
                content, or worship on the Internet,'' after 
                ``confiscations of property,'';
                    (B) in paragraph (5), by amending the second 
                sentence to read as follows: ``In many countries, 
                religious believers are forced to meet secretly, and 
                religious leaders and believers are targeted by 
                national security forces, violent nonstate actors, and 
                hostile mobs.'';
                    (C) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph 
                (9); and
                    (D) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following 
                new paragraphs:
            ``(7) There is growing evidence that demonstrates a 
        connection between the absence of religious freedom and 
        increased levels of persecution of religious minorities, 
        religiously motivated conflict, violent extremism, and 
        terrorism, including the kind of terrorism that has reached the 
        United States.
            ``(8) It is increasingly clear that understanding religion 
        and the political and security implications of religious 
        motivation and conviction is critical to the success of United 
        States diplomacy and foreign policy initiatives as there are 
        studies that show--
                    ``(A) 75 percent of the world's population lives in 
                countries where the right to the freedom of religion 
                and belief is severely restricted, either by the 
                government or violent nonstate actors; and
                    ``(B) 84 percent of the world's population 
                identifies strongly with a specific religious group.''; 
                and
            (2) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following 
        new paragraph:
            ``(6) Because the promotion of international religious 
        freedom is a foreign policy strategy that protects other, 
        related human rights, advances democracy abroad, and advances 
        United States interests in stability, security, and development 
        globally, the promotion of international religious freedom 
        requires new and evolving policies, global religion engagement 
        strategies, and diplomatic responses that are drawn from the 
        expertise of the national security agencies, the diplomatic 
        services, Congress, and other governmental agencies and 
        nongovernmental organizations, and are coordinated across and 
        carried out by the entire range of Federal agencies that are 
        engaged with or conduct negotiations or United States 
        Government funded programs with governments or violent nonstate 
        actors that engage in or tolerate violations of religious 
        freedom.''.

                of religious freedom, terrorism, or violence or 
                discrimination targeting religious minorities.

        period,'' after ``may waive''; and

and persistent waivers for any country designated as a country of 
particular concern for religious freedom under section 402(b) for 
engaging in or tolerating particularly severe violations of religious 
freedom do not fulfill the purposes of this Act, and, given that 
promotion of religious freedom is a compelling interest of United 
States foreign policy, the President, the Secretary of State, and other 
executive branch officials, in consultation with Congress, should seek 
to find ways to address existing violations, on a country-by-country 
basis, through the actions specified in section 405 or other 
commensurate actions, possibly including through the actions described 
in section 605, or by some other action that addresses the specific 
religious freedom violations of each country designated.''.

Congress that the foreign government has taken substantial and 
verifiable steps to cease the particularly severe violations of 
religious freedom.''.

``SEC. 405A. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR 
              CONCERN DESIGNATION FOR VIOLENT NONSTATE ACTORS.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Since 1998, various administrations have made 
        designations targeting violent nonstate actors who engaged in 
        or tolerated systematic, egregious, or ongoing violations of 
        religious freedom, such as the Taliban and Serbian groups 
        carrying on atrocities against Bosnians.
            ``(2) Over the past 10 years the number of violent nonstate 
        actors has increased, as have violations of religious freedom 
        perpetuated by such actors.
    ``(b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the United 
States Government that--
            ``(1) violent nonstate actors should be eligible for 
        designation as countries of particular concern described in 
        section 402(b) and that Presidential actions described in 
        section 405, 604, or 605 of this Act should be applicable to 
        violent nonstate actors or individual members of such groups; 
        and
            ``(2) the President should include, in the report to 
        Congress required by section 404, any reasons why violent 
        nonstate actors that engaged in or tolerated restrictions on 
        religious freedom, were not designated as countries of 
        particular concern, particularly if the Commission made a 
        recommendation for such a designation to the President and 
        whether any Presidential actions described in section 405, 604, 
        or 605 were taken against violent nonstate actors or individual 
        members of such groups.''.

United States institutions of higher education worldwide both for their 
potential for shaping positive leadership and new educational models in 
host countries and for their emphasis on teaching universally 
recognized rights of free inquiry and academic freedom.
    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United 
States institutions of higher education operating campuses outside the 
United States or establishing any educational entities with foreign 
governments, particularly with or in countries the governments of which 
engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom as 
identified in the Annual Report and the annual report of the 
Congressional-Executive Commission on China, should adopt a code of 
conduct--
            ``(1) upholding the right of freedom of religion of their 
        employees and students, including the right to manifest that 
        religion peacefully as protected in international law;
            ``(2) ensuring that the religious views and peaceful 
        practice of religion in no way affect, or be allowed to affect, 
        the status of a worker's or faculty member's employment or a 
        student's enrollment; and

        memoranda of understanding engaged in or constructed with a 
        foreign government to establish any educational entity, shall 
        be open, transparent, and made available for public inspection 
        before conclusion and that any such agreement shall affirm, at 
        all times, academic freedom and universal rights to the 
        freedoms of religion, speech, assembly, and association.

              PROMOTE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM THROUGH UNITED STATES FOREIGN 
              POLICY.

            ``(1) the annual national security strategy report of the 
        President required by section 108 of the National Security Act 
        of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) should promote international religious 
        freedom as a foreign policy and national security priority and 
        should articulate that promotion of the right to freedom of 
        religion is a strategy that protects other, related human 
        rights, and advances democracy outside the United States, and 
        make clear its importance to United States foreign policy goals 
        of stability, security, development, and diplomacy; and
            ``(2) the national security strategy report should be a 
        guide for the strategies and activities of relevant Federal 
        agencies and inform the Department of Defense quadrennial 
        defense review under section 118 of title 10, United States 
        Code, and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and 
        Development Review.''.
