    (a) In General.--Section 205(c)(2)(C) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 405(c)(2)(C)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(xiv)(I) The Commissioner of Social Security shall ensure that no 
document sent by mail by the Social Security Administration includes a 
complete social security account number unless the Commissioner 
determines that inclusion of such complete number is necessary.
    ``(II) Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of 
this clause and not later than each of March 31 and September 30 of 
each of the first 6 years following the year in which such date of 
enactment occurs, the Commissioner of Social Security shall submit to 
the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate a report on the implementation of 
subclause (I). Such report shall include--
            ``(aa) the title and identification number of each document 
        used by the Social Security Administration during the previous 
        year on which is printed an individual's complete social 
        security account number;
            ``(bb) the most recent date on which each such document was 
        updated; and
            ``(cc) the projected date on which complete social security 
        account numbers will be removed from each such document, or if 
        the Commissioner determines that inclusion of such complete 
        number is necessary, the rationale for such determination.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The Commissioner of Social Security shall 
implement the amendments made under subsection (a) as soon as 
practicable after the date of the enactment of this Act.
