To establish a pilot program on partnership agreements to construct new 
           facilities for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PILOT PROGRAM FOR PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS TO CONSTRUCT NEW 
              FACILITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may carry out a 
program under which the Secretary may enter into up to 5 partnership 
arrangements with a State or local authority, a 501(c)(3) corporation, 
a limited liability corporation, private entity, donor or donor group, 
or other non-Federal entity, to conduct one or more ``super 
construction projects'' (as defined in section 8103 of title 38, United 
States Code), ``major construction projects'' (as defined in section 
8104 of title 38, United States Code), or major construction projects 
to construct a new cemetery, or to develop additional gravesites or 
columbarium niches at an existing cemetery.
    (b) Application of Certain Laws.--This authority may be carried out 
notwithstanding any other law (including section 8103(e) of the title 
38, United States Code), except for those Federal laws relating to 
environmental and historic preservation, and the Davis-Bacon Act 
(sections 3141 through 3148 of title 40, United States Code).
    (c) Selection of Projects.--The projects that the Secretary may 
select for this program may be ones for which--
            (1)(A) Congress has appropriated partial funding for the 
        designated project; or
            (B) Veterans Affairs has identified a need for the project 
        through its long-range capital planning process, by listing the 
        project on the Major Construction Strategic Capital Investment 
        Planning (SCIP) priority list, submitted to Congress in its 
        annual budget submission; and
            (2) a non-Federal entity has or is willing to enter into a 
        formal agreement with the Secretary, to independently finance 
        and/or donate funds towards the underlying project, in an 
        amount acceptable and at no additional cost to the government.
    (d) Agreements.--Each partnership agreement for regarding the 
designated project shall provide:
            (1) The non-Federal entity shall conduct any necessary 
        environmental and historic preservation due diligence, comply 
        with local zoning requirements (except for studies and 
        consultations required of the Department under Federal law), 
        and obtain any permits required before beginning construction.
            (2) The non-Federal entity shall use Veterans Affairs 
        construction standards when designing and building the project, 
        except to the extent the Secretary deems otherwise.
            (3) The non-Federal entity shall form a Board of Directors 
        comprised of between 5 and 10 members, and a designated Chair 
        to oversee the Board. At least 1 member of the Board shall be a 
        Veteran who is not an employee of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs. The proposed or existing Board members shall be 
        required to promptly disclose any actual or potential conflicts 
        to the Secretary, and must agree as a condition of their 
        appointment, to remove themselves from Board membership if the 
        Chairman and Secretary agree that doing so is appropriate due 
        to an underlying apparent or existing conflict. At least 1 
        member of the Board shall be an employee of the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs, and function as a non-voting member of the 
        Board.
            (4) Within 180 days of inception or other timeframe as the 
        Secretary shall approve, the Board shall establish a written 
        Charter of the Board of Directors, to describe the roles, 
        responsibilities, policies, and procedures of operation, to 
        help ensure successful project management, design, and 
        construction, and completion of the designated project. The 
        Board shall be responsible for overseeing the activities needed 
        to finance, design, and construct the designated project for 
        the Department. The Board shall provide written updates to the 
        Secretary regarding the status of the designated project, on 
        occasions and a frequency that he shall approve.
            (5) The Board shall defer to the Secretary on all matters 
        that are inherent to the Department's mission and operations, 
        including conditional or final acceptance of the designated 
        project. The Board shall not dissolve until after the 
        Department has provided its final acceptance of the completed 
        designated project, plus any additional time or later event 
        that the Board of Directors and Secretary shall jointly 
        approve.
    (e) Project Funds.--Except as to the designated project identified 
in subsection (j) and except to the extent that Congress later provides

Secretary may provide funds to help finance, design, and construct the 
designated project, in an amount not to exceed the total dollars that 
Congress has appropriated at the time of the partnership agreement 
between the Department and non-Federal entity. The Secretary shall be 
permitted to provide such funds under terms, conditions, and schedule 
that the Secretary deems appropriate. The non-Federal entity shall be

designated project.
