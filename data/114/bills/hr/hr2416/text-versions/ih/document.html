    ``(c) Program Framework.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date 
        of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall establish a 
        draft framework for implementation of the program under this

            ``(2) Contents of framework.--The framework shall include 
        information describing--
                    ``(A) the current sources of data developed through 
                clinical experience, including ongoing safety 
                surveillance, registry, claims, and patient-centered 
                outcomes research activities;
                    ``(B) the gaps in current data collection 
                activities;
                    ``(C) the current standards and methodologies for 
                collection and analysis of data generated through 
                clinical experience; and
                    ``(D) the priority areas, remaining challenges, and 
                potential pilot opportunities that the program 
                established under this section will address.
            ``(3) Consultation.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In developing the program 
                framework under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
                consult with regulated industry, academia, medical 
                professional organizations, representatives of patient 
                advocacy organizations, disease research foundations, 
                and other interested parties.
                    ``(B) Process.--The consultation under subparagraph 
                (A) may be carried out through approaches such as--

                        entities described in such subparagraph, in 
                        which the Secretary may participate; or
                            ``(ii) a contract, grant, or other 
                        arrangement, as determined appropriate by the 
                        Secretary with such a partnership or an 
                        independent research organization.
    ``(d) Program Implementation.--The Secretary shall, not later than 
24 months after the date of enactment of this section and in accordance 
with the framework established under subsection (c), implement the 
program to evaluate the potential use of evidence from clinical 
experience.
    ``(e) Guidance for Industry.--The Secretary shall--
            ``(1) utilize the program established in subsection (d), 
        its activities, and any subsequent pilots or written reports, 
        to inform a guidance for industry on--
                    ``(A) the circumstances under which sponsors of 
                drugs and the Secretary may rely on evidence from 
                clinical experience for the purposes described in 
                subsections (a)(1) or (a)(2); and

            ``(3) not later than 48 months after the date of enactment 
        of this section, after providing an opportunity for public 
        comment on the draft guidance, issue final guidance.
    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--
            ``(1) Subject to paragraph (2), nothing in this section 
        prohibits the Secretary from using evidence from clinical

        the Secretary determines that sufficient basis exists for any 
        such non-specified use.
            ``(2) This section shall not be construed to alter--
                    ``(A) the standards of evidence under--
                            ``(i) subsection (c) or (d) of section 505, 
                        including the substantial evidence standard in 
                        such subsection (d); or
                            ``(ii) section 351(a) of the Public Health 
                        Service Act; or
                    ``(B) the Secretary's authority to require post-
                approval studies or clinical trials, or the standards 
                of evidence under which studies or trials are 
                evaluated.''.
