    (b) Consistent Treatment of Dependent Children.--Paragraph (2) of

follows:
            ``(2) Dependent children annuity.--
                    ``(A) Annuity when no eligible surviving spouse.--
                In the case of a person described in paragraph (1), the 
                Secretary concerned shall pay an annuity under this 
                subchapter to the dependent children of that person 
                under section 1450(a)(2) of this title as applicable.
                    ``(B) Optional annuity when there is an eligible 
                surviving spouse.--The Secretary may pay an annuity 
                under this subchapter to the dependent children of a 
                person described in paragraph (1) under section 
                1450(a)(3) of this title, if applicable, instead of 
                paying an annuity to the surviving spouse under 
                paragraph (1), if the Secretary concerned, in 
                consultation with the surviving spouse, determines it 
                appropriate to provide an annuity for the dependent 
                children under this paragraph instead of an annuity for 
                the surviving spouse under paragraph (1).''.
    (c) Deemed Elections.--Section 1448(f) of title 10, United States 
Code, is further amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(5) Deemed election to provide an annuity for 
        dependent.--Paragraph (6) of subsection (d) shall apply in the 
        case of a member described in paragraph (1) who dies after 
        November 23, 2003, when no other annuity is payable on behalf 
        of the member under this subchapter.''.

        chapter 73 of title 10, United States Code, shall accrue to any 
        person by reason of the amendments made by this section for any 
        period before the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Elections.--For any death that occurred before the date 
        of the enactment of this Act with respect to which an annuity 
        under such subchapter is being paid (or could be paid) to a 
        surviving spouse, the Secretary concerned may, within six 
        months of that date and in consultation with the surviving 
        spouse, determine it appropriate to provide an annuity for the 
        dependent children of the decedent under paragraph 
        1448(f)(2)(B) of title 10, as added by subsection (b)(1), 
        instead of an annuity for the surviving spouse. Any such 
        determination and resulting change in beneficiary shall be 
        effective as of the first day of the first month following the 
        date of the determination.
