                                student.''.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that Federal and State prosecutors 
should exercise their prosecutorial discretion when considering 
bringing any criminal charges against any person who comes forward to 
report a sexual assault, and who, in making such report, admits to 
engaging in unlawful consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance.
