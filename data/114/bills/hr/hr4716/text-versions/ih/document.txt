To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to support 
teacher and school professional training on awareness of student mental 
           health conditions and suicide prevention efforts.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Support Our Students Act of 2016'' 
or the ``S.O.S. Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Approximately 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable mental 
        illness.
            (2) Fifty percent of all lifetime cases of lived experience 
        of mental illness begin by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.
            (3) Fifty percent of students with a mental illness, age 14 
        years and older, drop out of high school.
            (4) One in 10 children and adolescents suffer from mental 
        illness severe enough to cause some level of impairment, but 
        only 1 in 5 of such children receive specialty mental health 
        services.
            (5) For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the 
        third leading cause of death, and an estimated 90 percent have 
        a diagnosable mental health condition.
            (6) Annually, approximately 4,600 youth die as a result of 
        suicide and another 156,000 youth ages 10 to 24 are treated for 
        self-inflicted injuries at emergency rooms.
            (7) The overwhelming majority of individuals including 
        teens, who attempt suicide, have one or more psychiatric or 
        mental health conditions.
            (8) Suicide prevention and awareness efforts are key in 
        combating this often preventable loss of life.
