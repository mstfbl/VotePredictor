end the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Future Financing.--Neither this section, nor any plan of 
action or use agreement implementing this section, shall restrict an 
owner from obtaining a new loan or refinancing an existing loan secured 
by the project, or from distributing the proceeds of such a loan; 
except that, in conjunction with such refinancing--
            ``(1) the owner shall provide for adequate rehabilitation 
        pursuant to a capital needs assessment to ensure long-term 
        sustainability of the property satisfactory to the lender or 
        bond issuance agency;
            ``(2) any resulting budget-based rent increase shall 
        include debt service on the new financing, commercially 
        reasonable debt service coverage, and replacement reserves as 
        required by the lender; and
            ``(3) for tenants of dwelling units not covered by a 
        project- or tenant-based rental subsidy, any rent increases 
        resulting from the refinancing transaction may not exceed 10 
        percent per year, except that--
                    ``(A) any tenant occupying a dwelling unit as of 
                time of the refinancing may not be required to pay for 
                rent and utilities, for the duration of such tenancy, 
                an amount that exceeds the greater of--
                            ``(i) 30 percent of the tenant's income; or
                            ``(ii) the amount paid by the tenant for 
                        rent and utilities immediately before such 
                        refinancing; and
                    ``(B) this paragraph shall not apply to any tenant 
                who does not provide the owner with proof of income.
Paragraph (3) may not be construed to limit any rent increases 
resulting from increased operating costs for a project.''.

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION.

    The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall issue any 
guidance that the Secretary considers necessary to carry out the 
provisions added by the amendments made by sections 2 and 3 not later
