    (d) Carrizo Cane Eradication.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
                    (A) Carrizo cane is a non-native, invasive plant 
                growing along the Rio Grande River in Texas, with 
                heights of up to 27 feet tall.
                    (B) According to U.S. Customs and Border 
                Protection, ``the [Carrizo cane] plant causes serious 
                officer safety issues and operational concerns because 
                it hampers enforcement along the [Rio Grande] river. 
                The plant also provides concealment to criminals, drug 
                smugglers, illegal aliens, and potential terrorists who 
                could use it as an advantage to enter the Unites States 
                illegally. The obvious officer safety hazards created 
                by this situation are of grave concern to the Border 
                Patrol and need to be remedied''.
            (2) Eradication.--The Chief of the Border Patrol shall 
        coordinate with the heads of each relevant Federal and State 
        agency to eradicate, to the greatest extent practicable, the 
        Carrizo cane plant along the Rio Grande River.
    (e) Consultation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult 
with the governors of each southern border State, including southern 
border maritime States, representatives of the Border Patrol and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection, and relevant Federal, State, local, and 
tribal agencies that have jurisdiction on the southern border, or in 
the maritime environment, to develop the operational plan required 
under subsection (f) and the metrics required under subsections (h), 
(i), (j), and (k).

        following:
                    (A) An unlawful border crossing effectiveness rate, 
                informed by situational awareness.
                    (B) A probability of detection that measures the 
                estimated total unlawful border crossing attempts not 
                detected by the Border Patrol against the unlawful 
                border crossing effectiveness rate referred to in
