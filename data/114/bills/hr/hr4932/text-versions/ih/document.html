                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to expand and clarify the 
  prohibition on inaccurate caller identification information and to 
     require providers of telephone service to offer technology to 
 subscribers to reduce the incidence of unwanted telephone calls, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Repeated Objectionable Bothering of 
Consumers on Phones Act'' or the ``ROBOCOP Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The incidence of unwanted telephone calls is a 
        nationwide nuisance.
            (2) In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission received over 3.5 
        million complaints about such calls.
            (3) Telephone scammers target vulnerable consumers, 
        particularly the elderly.
            (4) The national ``do-not-call'' registry has effectively 
        addressed unwanted telephone calls from legitimate companies, 
        but consumers continue to be subject to unwanted calls 
        originating from sources outside the United States and 
        illegitimate operators.
            (5) Such calls cost consumers an estimated $350 million in 
        2011.
            (6) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this 
        problem.
            (7) Preventing such calls from reaching consumers requires 
        two approaches:
                    (A) Identifying unwanted calls.
                    (B) Giving the consumers the ability to block or 
                filter such calls.

SEC. 3. EXPANDING AND CLARIFYING PROHIBITION ON INACCURATE CALLER ID 
              INFORMATION.

            (2) Deadline.--The Federal Communications Commission shall

                    (A) The extent to which subscribers continue to 
                receive calls with misleading or inaccurate caller 
                identification information (except for calls from 
                entities with a legitimate need and calls exempted 
                pursuant to section 227(e)(3)(B)(ii) of the 
                Communications Act of 1934), including a quantitative 
                assessment of the change in the number of complaints 
                made to the Commission regarding such calls before the 
                effective date of the regulations required by paragraph

                enable technology offered in accordance with section 
                227(d)(4)(A)(ii)(II) of the Communications Act of 1934, 
                as added by section 4 of this Act, continue to receive 
                calls originating from an automatic telephone dialing 
                system or using an artificial or prerecorded voice 
                (except for calls from public safety entities and calls 
                to which subscribers have provided prior express 
                consent), including a quantitative assessment of the 
                change in the number of complaints made to the 
                Commission regarding such calls before the effective 
                date of the regulations required by such section and 
                after such effective date.
                    (C) An assessment of whether the standards set 
                forth in such regulations have been successful in 
                reducing the number of the calls described in each of 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B) received by subscribers, and 
                whether there have been any problems with such 
                standards or the technology required by such standards, 
                such as the prevention of calls from public safety 
                entities or calls to which subscribers have provided 
                prior express consent.
                    (D) Any recommendations for legislative or 
                regulatory action to improve such standards.
            (2) Termination.--The date of termination described in this 
        paragraph is the date on which the Federal Communications 
        Commission, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, 
        determines that the report required by paragraph (1) is no 
        longer necessary because of a substantial reduction in the 
        number of calls described in each of subparagraphs (A) and (B) 
        of such paragraph.
