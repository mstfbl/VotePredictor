            (2) Selection considerations.--
                    (A) In general.--In awarding grants under this

                        students; or
                            (ii) the need for additional services

                this section only to supplement the funds that would, 
                in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available 
                from State, local, and private sources for the program, 
                and not to supplant such funds.
    (e) Evaluation and Accountability Plan.--The Secretary shall 
develop an evaluation and accountability plan for programs funded under 
this section to measure objectively the following:
            (1) The ability of the program to establish or expand 
        services provided to Dreamer students.
            (2) Graduation rates of Dreamer students.
    (f) Online Publication of Progress Results.--The Secretary of 
Education shall publish progress results online.
    (g) Dreamer Students.--In this section, the term ``Dreamer 
student'' means an individual who is a beneficiary of, or eligible for, 
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program pursuant to the 
memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security dated June 15, 2012, 
or November 20, 2014.
    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary
