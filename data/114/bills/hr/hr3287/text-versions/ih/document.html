                beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
                subsection, any specified entity which (after such 
                acquisition or transfer) qualifies as a bank under

                        to such specified entity by treating such

                apply.--Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply if 
                the specified entity referred to in such subparagraphs
