the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall--

    ``(c) Content.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary--
            ``(1) shall provide for the collection and storage of 
        information on the incidence and prevalence of hydrocephalus in 
        the United States;
            ``(2) to the extent practicable, shall provide for the 
        collection and storage of other available information on 
        hydrocephalus, such as information concerning--
