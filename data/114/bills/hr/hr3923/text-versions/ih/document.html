To provide for a report that develops recommended United States energy 
                      security valuation methods.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ENERGY SECURITY VALUATION.

    (a) Establishment of Energy Security Valuation Methods.--Not later 
than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Energy, in collaboration with the Secretary of State, shall develop and 
transmit, after public notice and comment, to the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report that develops 
recommended United States energy security valuation methods. In 
developing the report, the Secretaries may consider the recommendations 
of the Administration's Quadrennial Energy Review released on April 21, 
2015. The report shall--
            (1) evaluate and define United States energy security to 
        reflect modern domestic and global energy markets and the 
        collective needs of the United States and its allies and 
        partners;
            (2) identify transparent and uniform or coordinated 
        procedures and criteria to ensure that energy-related actions 
        that significantly affect the supply, distribution, or use of 
        energy are evaluated with respect to their potential impact on 
        energy security, including their impact on--
                    (A) consumers and the economy;
                    (B) energy supply diversity and resiliency;
                    (C) well-functioning and competitive energy 
                markets;
                    (D) United States trade balance; and
                    (E) national security objectives; and
            (3) include a recommended implementation strategy that 
        identifies and aims to ensure that the procedures and criteria 
        referred to in paragraph (2) are--
                    (A) evaluated consistently across the Federal 
                Government; and
                    (B) weighed appropriately and balanced with 
                environmental considerations required by Federal law.
    (b) Participation.--In developing the report referred to in 
subsection (a), the Secretaries may consult with relevant Federal, 
State, private sector, and international participants, as appropriate 
and consistent with applicable law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
