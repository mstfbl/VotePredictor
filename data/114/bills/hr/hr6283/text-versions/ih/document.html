            ``(3) in the case of any rule to which the exception under 
        subsection (b)(B) applies.''.
    (c) Lookback Period for Interim Final Rules.--Section 553 of title 
5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) In the case of a rule making in which the exception under 
subsection (b)(B) was applied, by not later than 18 months after the 
rule takes effect, the agency shall provide for a period in which 
interested persons may submit written data, views, or arguments, in the 
same manner as submissions under subsection (c), shall give such 
submissions due consideration, and, if appropriate, repeal or amend the

    (a) Study and Report.--Not later than 9 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Administrative Conference of the United 
States shall complete a study and submit to Congress a report thereon 
that examines--
            (1) the extent to which persons, for projects subject to a 
        permitting process under the environmental laws of a State or 
        under a Federal environmental law, are subject to unnecessary, 
        impractical, or inappropriately dilatory requirements to engage 
        in mitigation of environmental harms;
            (2) categories of projects subject to a permitting process 
        under the environmental laws of a State or under a Federal 
        environmental law for which it would be appropriate to 
        establish a deadline by which a final determination on the 
        issuance of a permit should be made;
            (3) changes to permitting processes under Federal 
        environmental law that would provide for increased protections 
        of the rights of parties applying for permits, including 
        increased use of administrative law judges in permitting 
        determinations, and finalizing agency action more 
        expeditiously; and
            (4) categories of Federal rule making that would be more 
        appropriately addressed by State action.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``permit'' means an agency's statutorily 
        authorized, discretionary, judicially reviewable granting of 
        permission to do something that would otherwise be statutorily 
        prohibited; and
            (2) the term ``State'' means each of the several States.
    (c) Reporting to ACUS.--Any agency that makes any determination 
pertaining to a permit that, in the determination of the Administrator 
of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of 
Management and Budget, would result in a cost of more than $25,000,000 
shall report such determination, and submit a copy of the requested 
permit, to the Administrative Conference of the United States by not 
later than 30 days after such determination.
