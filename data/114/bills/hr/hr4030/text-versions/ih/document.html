 To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that refugees 
may not be resettled in any State where the governor of that State has 
taken any action formally disapproving of the resettlement of refugees 
                 in that State, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES.

    Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(g) Limitation on Resettlement.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this section, the Director or the Federal agency administering 
        subsection (b)(1) may not provide for the resettlement of any 
        refugee in a fiscal year in any State where the Governor of 
        that State has taken any action formally disapproving of the 
        resettlement of refugees, or of certain refugees, in that State 
        during that fiscal year.
            ``(2) Receipt of funds.--A State where the Governor of the 
        State has taken action described in paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) in the case of such an action which 
                disapproves of the resettlement of any refugee in that 
                State, may not receive any funds under this section 
                during that fiscal year; or
                    ``(B) in the case of such an action which 
                disapproves of the resettlement of only certain 
                refugees in that State, shall receive a reduction in 
                any funds which the State would otherwise receive under 
                this section, as determined to be proportionate to the 
                number of refugees not resettled pursuant to such 
                action by the Director or the Federal agency 
                administering subsection (b)(1), as appropriate.''.
