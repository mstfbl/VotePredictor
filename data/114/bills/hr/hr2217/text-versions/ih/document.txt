                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Head Start Act to promote trauma-informed practices, age-
appropriate positive behavioral intervention and support, services for 
    young children who have experienced trauma or toxic stress, and 
 improved coordination between Head Start agencies and other programs 
                    that serve very young children.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Caring Start Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Neglect, hunger, abuse, and other forms of trauma 
        present significant challenges to young children's learning and 
        social-emotional development.
            (2) Trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive caregiving is an 
        ideal targeted intervention for vulnerable children who 
        experience trauma.
            (3) A child's development relies significantly on the 
        development of executive function skills, including cognitive 
        flexibility, self-regulation, and effortful control and 
        attention.
            (4) Focusing on these skills, even though they are not 
        obviously academic, is critical in order to improve children's 
        long-term outcomes.
            (5) Providing high-quality early childhood education can 
        protect young children from some of the most adverse effects of 
        poverty, enable their healthy development, strengthen their 
        health, and reduce or mediate toxic stress responses to adverse 
        experiences.
            (6) Robust support, professional development, and 
        specialized training for the early education and care workforce 
        is essential to providing a high-quality early education to 
        every child.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS.
