SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) A combination of structural problems, mounting debt, 
        and weak public finances has left Puerto Rico in a financial 
        debt crisis and resulted in continued outmigration of residents 
        and business from Puerto Rico further stifling growth.
            (2) A comprehensive, long-term approach must be established 
        to initiate significant reforms to restore to Puerto Rico 
        access to short-term and long-term lending, eliminate annual 
        deficits, and reduce its debt.
            (3) The current crisis requires congressional action that 
        supports Puerto Rico by providing the appropriate tools needed 
        to restore financial stability while respecting and 
        strengthening its authority to operate and grow independently.

        appropriate; or
            (B) the Government of Puerto Rico adopts or implements 
        remedial action (including revising the financial plan and 
        budget pursuant to section 202(e)) to correct the inconsistency 
        which the Council finds reasonable and appropriate, taking into 
        account the terms of the financial plan and budget; and
