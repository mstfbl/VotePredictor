SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE WITH INTERAGENCY SECURITY COMMITTEE MINIMUM SECURITY 
              STANDARDS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On October 19, 1995, six months after the Oklahoma City 
        bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, President 
        Clinton issued Executive Order 12977, creating the Interagency 
        Security Committee to address continuing Government-wide 
        security for Federal facilities. The Committee's mandate is to 
        enhance the quality and effectiveness of physical security in, 
        and the protection of, non-military Federal facilities in the 
        United States, whether Government-owned, -leased, or -managed. 
        Today, the Committee is comprised of chief security officers 
        and other senior executives from 54 Federal agencies and 
        departments.
            (2) On September 7, 2012, the primary members of the 
        Interagency Security Committee approved ``The Risk Management 
        Process: An Interagency Security Committee Standard'', which 
        was issued in August 2013.
            (3) Consistent with Executive Order 12977, ``The Risk 
        Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee 
        Standard'' is intended to be applied to all facilities in the 
        United States occupied by Federal employees for non-military 
        activities. This standard defines the criteria and processes 
        that those individuals responsible for the security of such a 
        facility should use to determine such a facility's security 
        level, and provides an integrated, single source of physical 
        security countermeasures for all such non-military Federal 
        facilities.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Interagency Security Committee standards for Federal facilities 
established by the Interagency Security Committee in the document 
entitled ``The Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security 
Committee Standard'' published in August 2013 and successor documents 
should be utilized, as appropriate, to protect all non-military Federal 
facilities.
    (c) Assessment.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to 
the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
Senate an assessment of the degree to which the standards specified in 
the ``The Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee 
Standard'', approved by the Interagency Security Committee, is utilized 
by all non-military Federal facilities and what, if any, barriers exist 
to utilization of such standards.

SEC. 4. RESEARCH.

    (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting 
through the Director of the Federal Protective Service, shall commence 
a one-year pilot program to research the advantages of converting guard 
positions at the highest-risk Federal facilities protected by the 
Federal Protective Service from contract guard positions to positions 
held by Federal employees.
    (b) Requirements.--At a minimum, the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall conduct the pilot program described in subsection (a) at one 
level III facility and one level IV facility in each of Federal 
Protective Service regions I, III, V, and VII, by hiring individuals to 
fill guard positions at each facility that participates in such pilot 
program in accordance with subsection (c).
    (c) Federal Facility Security Guard Position.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, and subject

                consistent with applicable protocols and protections; 
                and
                    (C) responding to specific security incidents, 
                including preparing for and responding to an act of 
                terrorism, that can occur at a Federal facility, 
                including response with force if necessary.
            (3) Limitation.--Individuals hired pursuant to paragraph 
        (1) may not be Federal law enforcement officers.

assign, on a temporary basis, existing personnel employed by the

security guard services under subsection (c) in furtherance of the such 
program, if the Secretary determines that individuals cannot be hired 
and trained pursuant to such subsection in a timely manner.
    (e) Maintenance of Law Enforcement Personnel.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
acting through the Director of the Federal Protective Service, shall

officers as is necessary to provide arrest authority and law 
enforcement support at each such facility, including support for 
Federal facility security guards hired pursuant to subsection (c) at 
each such facility, in the event of a terrorist attack, security 
incident, or other incident.
    (f) Departmental Evaluation.--Not later than 120 days after the 
completion of the pilot program described in subsection (a), the 
Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on 
Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the 
Comptroller General of the United States a report on such program that 
includes information on performance, including screener performance, of 
individuals participating in such program, and presented in a format 
that is able to be compared to prior covert testing data collected by 
the Comptroller General regarding contract guard performance.
    (g) Comptroller General Report.--Not later than 120 days after the 
receipt of the departmental evaluation under subsection (f), the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the Committee 
on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report 
that evaluates how the Department of Homeland Security carried out such 
pilot program, reviews the Secretary of Homeland Security's evaluation 
of performance under such subsection, and, to the degree practicable,

the Federal Protective Service's contract guard program.
    (h) Implementation.--Unless the Secretary of Homeland Security 
determines in the evaluation required under subsection (f) that overall 
performance was not acceptable of the individuals participating in the 
pilot program described in subsection (a), the Secretary, acting 
through the Director of the Federal Protective Service, shall, to the 
degree practicable, maintain Federal employees as Federal facility 
security guards at all level III and level IV Federal facilities

        programs and activities;
            (2) an assessment of the appropriateness and adaptability 
        of the structure of the fees charged to occupants of Federal 
        facilities protected by the Federal Protective Service, and the 
        degree to which such structure takes into account the actual 
        costs incurred by the Federal Protective Service, particularly 
        with respect to those instances in which the Federal Protective 
        Service provides heightened security in response to information 
        on current threats;
            (3) an assessment of the extent to which such fee-based 
        system impedes the Federal Protective Service from executing 
        its operations and implementing oversight, inspections, and 
        security enhancements;
            (4) recommendations, as appropriate, for alterations to the 
        current system and alternative funding approaches (including a 
        mix of fees and appropriations); and
            (5) options to mitigate challenges in budgeting, such as an 
        alternative account structure to increase flexibility, while 
        maintaining accountability and transparency.
