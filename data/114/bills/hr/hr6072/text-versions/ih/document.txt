    (a) Requirements Described.--Section 301(a) of the Help America 
Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new paragraphs:

        emergency.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In the event of a failure of 
                voting equipment or other circumstance at a polling 
                place in an election for Federal office that causes an 
                unreasonable delay, the appropriate election official 
                at the polling place shall--
                            ``(i) immediately advise any individual who 
                        is waiting at the polling place to cast a 
                        ballot in the election at the time of the 
                        failure that the individual has the right to 
                        use an emergency paper ballot; and
                            ``(ii) upon the individual's request, 
                        provide the individual with an emergency paper 
                        ballot for the election and the supplies 
                        necessary to mark the ballot.
                    ``(B) Treatment of ballots.--Any paper ballot which 
                is cast by an individual under this clause shall be 
                counted and otherwise treated as a regular ballot for 
                all purposes (including by incorporating it into the 
                final unofficial vote count (as defined by the State) 
                for the precinct) and not as a provisional ballot, 
                unless the individual casting the ballot would have 
                otherwise been required to cast a provisional ballot.

provided under section 323(b), the organizational independence) of 
entities performing financial audits, attestation engagements, and
