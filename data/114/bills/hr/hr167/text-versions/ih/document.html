                year is enacted that specifies an amount for wildfire 
                suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management 
                accounts at the Department of Agriculture or the

                suppression operations for that fiscal year, but shall 
                not exceed $2,689,000,000 in additional new budget 
                authority in each of fiscal years 2015 through 2022.
                    ``(ii) If the Secretary of the Interior or the 
                Secretary of Agriculture determines that supplemental 
                appropriations are necessary for a fiscal year for 
                wildfire suppression operations, such Secretary shall 
                promptly submit to Congress--
                            ``(I) a request for such supplemental 
                        appropriations; and

                        such Secretary intends to obligate the 
                        supplemental appropriations within 30 days 
                        after the date on which such supplemental 
                        appropriations are made available.
                    ``(iii) The average costs for wildfire suppression 
                operations over the previous 10 years shall be 
                calculated annually and reported in the President's 
                budget submission under section 1105(a) of title 31,

                    ``(iv) As used in this subparagraph--
                            ``(I) the term `additional new budget 
                        authority' means the amount provided for a 
                        fiscal year, in excess of 70 percent of the 
                        average costs for wildfire suppression 
                        operations over the previous 10 years, in an 
                        appropriation Act and specified to pay for the 
                        costs of wildfire suppression operations; and
                            ``(II) the term `wildfire suppression 
                        operations' means the emergency and 
                        unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting 
                        including support, response, and emergency 
                        stabilization activities, other emergency 
                        management activities, and funds necessary to 
                        repay any transfers needed for these costs.''.
