Investment of Our Retired Seniors Act of 2015'' or the ``SENIORS Act of

            (1) seniors, especially those on a fixed income, who were 
        promised social security benefits, paid into the system, and 
        now rely on those benefits, receive a proper cost-of-living 
        increase to fulfill their needs; and
            (2) Congress, in coordination with the heads of the Social 
        Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Labor, 
        should develop a legislative solution to ensure that the cost-
        of-living adjustment formula for Social Security adequately 
        reflects beneficiaries' needs.
