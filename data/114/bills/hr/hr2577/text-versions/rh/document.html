Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that project-
based contracts remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the 
exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety after written 
notice to and informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other

management of public housing as authorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of 
the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the 
Secretary shall not impose any requirement or guideline relating to 
asset management that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital 
funds for central office costs pursuant to section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)): 
Provided, That a public housing agency may not use capital funds 
authorized under section 9(d) for activities that are eligible under 
section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the operating fund in 
excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).
    Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such 
allotment holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control procedures and directives. 
The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained 
allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the accounts ``Executive 
Offices'' and ``Administrative Support Offices'', as well as each 
account receiving appropriations for ``Program Office Salaries and 
Expenses'', ``Government National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of 
Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and 
``Office of Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.
    Sec. 221.  The Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development shall, for fiscal year 2016, notify the public through the 
Federal Register and other means, as determined appropriate, of the 
issuance of a notice of the availability of assistance or notice of 
funding availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund 
administered by the Secretary that is to be competitively awarded. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for fiscal year 2016, the 
Secretary may make the NOFA available only on the Internet at the 
appropriate Government web site or through other electronic media, as 
determined by the Secretary.

    Sec. 224. (a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall 
take the required actions under subsection (b) when a multifamily 
housing project with a section 8 contract or contract for similar 
project-based assistance:

        of 30 or less; or
            (2) receives a REAC score between 31 and 59 and:

Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public

        for correcting all deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide 
        notice of the Plan to the owner, tenants, the local government, 
        any mortgagees, and any contract administrator.
            (2) At the end of the term of the Compliance, Disposition 
        and Enforcement Plan, if the owner fails to fully comply with 
        such plan, the Secretary may require immediate replacement of 
        project management with a management agent approved by the 
        Secretary, and shall take one or more of the following actions, 
        and provide additional notice of those actions to the owner and 
        the parties specified above:

                    (B) abate the section 8 contract, including partial 
                abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all 
                deficiencies have been corrected;
                    (C) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, 
                approved by the Secretary under established procedures, 
                which will be obligated to promptly make all required 
                repairs and to accept renewal of the assistance

                or seek a judicial order of specific performance 
                requiring the owner to cure all project deficiencies.
    (c) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of 
contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for 
imminent major threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 
524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 
1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in 
consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for project-
based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other 
existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The

section that are assessed through the Real Estate Assessment Center and 
have physical inspection scores of less than 30 or have consecutive 
physical inspection scores of less than 60. The report shall include:
            (1) The enforcement actions being taken to address such 
        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have 
        such conditions multiple times; and

        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified

Provided, That in addition, $42,000,000 shall be made available until

conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) shall 
        make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match 
        to be determined by NRC based on affordability and the economic 
        conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by NRC based 
        on the aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas 
        with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate 
        the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied 
        single-family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other 
        than areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants 
        may also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries 
        based on a geographic analysis of the Nation by NRC which 
        determines where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are 
        risky and likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages 
        that are likely to default and face foreclosure. A State 
        Housing Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State 
        Housing Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this 
        paragraph. A HUD-approved counseling intermediary shall meet 
        certain mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling 
        requirements, as determined by NRC, and shall be approved by 
        HUD or NRC as meeting these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only 
        be made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result 
        in the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained 
        pursuant to such activity or another positive outcome for the 
        homeowner. No funds made available under this paragraph may be 
        provided directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge 
        outstanding mortgage balances or for any other direct debt 
        reduction payments.
            (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance 
        by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds 
        under this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise 
        in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a 
        certification by NRC that the procedures for selection do not 
        consist of any procedures or activities that could be construed 
        as a conflict of interest or have the appearance of 
        impropriety.
            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall 
        have demonstrated experience in successfully working with 
        financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default,
