the Secretary of Transportation provides notification in writing to the 
following committees: the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations; the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate; and the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of

        funding, as determined by the Secretary, and to avoid or reduce 
        the proration of renewal funding allocations:  Provided 
        further, That up to $75,000,000 shall be available only: (A)

        leasing of vouchers that were issued but not leased prior to 
        the end of such calendar year; (E) for public housing agencies

        insufficient funding; and (F) for adjustments in the 
        allocations for public housing agencies that experienced a 
        significant increase, as determined by the Secretary, in 
        renewal costs as a result of participation in the Small Area

person to receive assistance under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), any financial assistance (in

mortgages under such section 255.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    Sec. 216.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in 
fiscal year 2016, in managing and disposing of any multifamily property 
that is owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, and during the process of foreclosure on any 
property with a contract for rental assistance payments under section 8 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the 
Secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are 
attached to any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the 
Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local 
government, that such a multifamily property owned or held by the 
Secretary is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments 
under such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of: (1) 
the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and all 
available Federal, State, and local resources, including rent 
adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing 
Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (``MAHRAA''); and (2) 
environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective 
fashion, the Secretary may, in consultation with the tenants of that 
property, contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an 
owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other 
rental assistance. The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to 
ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect prior to 
foreclosure, subject to the exercise of contractual abatement remedies 
to assist relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health 
and safety after written notice to and informed consent of the affected 
tenants and use of other available remedies, such as partial abatements 
or receivership. After disposition of any multifamily property 
described under this section, the contract and allowable rent levels on 
such properties shall be subject to the requirements under section 524 
of MAHRAA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    Sec. 217.  The commitment authority funded by fees as 
provided under the heading ``Community Development Loan Guarantees 
Program Account'' may be used to guarantee, or make commitments to 
guarantee, notes or other obligations issued by any State on behalf of

requirements of section 108 of the Housing and Community Development 
Act of 1974:  Provided, That any State receiving such a guarantee or

operating fund formula shall not be exempt from asset management 
requirements.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

management of public housing as authorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of 
the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g (d) and (e)), 
the Secretary shall not impose any requirement or guideline relating to 
asset management that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital 
funds for central office costs pursuant to section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g) (1) and 
(2)):  Provided, That a public housing agency may not use capital funds 
authorized under section 9(d) for activities that are eligible under 
section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the operating fund in 
excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) or 
9(g)(2).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment 
holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined 
that such allotment holder has implemented an adequate system of funds 
control and has received training in funds control procedures and 
directives. The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a 
trained allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the accounts 
``Executive Offices'' and ``Administrative Support Offices'', as well 
as each account receiving appropriations for ``Program Office Salaries 
and Expenses'', ``Government National Mortgage Association--Guarantees 
of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and 
``Office of Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    Sec. 221.  The Secretary of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall, for fiscal year 2016, notify the public 
through the Federal Register and other means, as determined 
appropriate, of the issuance of a notice of the availability of 
assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program or 
discretionary fund administered by the Secretary that is to be 
competitively awarded. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for 
fiscal year 2016, the Secretary may make the NOFA available only on the 
Internet at the appropriate Government web site or through other 
electronic media, as determined by the Secretary.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Sec. 224. (a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development shall take the required actions under subsection (b) when a 
multifamily housing project with a section 8 contract or contract for 
similar project-based assistance--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) receives a Real Estate Assessment Center 
        (REAC) score of 30 or less; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) receives a REAC score between 31 and 59; and--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) fails to certify in writing to HUD 
                within 60 days that all deficiencies have been

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) receives consecutive scores of less 
                than 60 on REAC inspections.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured 
projects with assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply 
to such units assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) 
or to public housing units assisted with capital or operating funds 
under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 
1437g).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    &lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) The Secretary shall take the following required 
actions as authorized under subsection (a):&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Secretary shall notify the owner and 
        provide an opportunity for response within 30 days. If the 
        violations remain, the Secretary shall develop a Compliance, 
        Disposition and Enforcement Plan within 60 days, with a 
        specified timetable for correcting all deficiencies. The 
        Secretary shall provide notice of the Plan to the owner, 
        tenants, the local government, any mortgagees, and any contract 
        administrator.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) At the end of the term of the Compliance, 
        Disposition and Enforcement Plan, if the owner fails to fully 
        comply with such plan, the Secretary may require immediate 
        replacement of project management with a management agent 
        approved by the Secretary, and shall take one or more of the 
        following actions, and provide additional notice of those 
        actions to the owner and the parties specified above--

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) impose civil money 
                penalties;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) abate the section 8 contract, 
                including partial abatement, as determined by the 
                Secretary, until all deficiencies have been 
                corrected;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) pursue transfer of the project to an 
                owner, approved by the Secretary under established 
                procedures, which will be obligated to promptly make 
                all required repairs and to accept renewal of the 
                assistance contract as long as such renewal is offered; 
                or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) seek judicial appointment of a 
                receiver to manage the property and cure all project 
                deficiencies or seek a judicial order of specific 
                performance requiring the owner to cure all project 
                deficiencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to 
ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the 
exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety after written 
notice to and informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
remedies set forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in 
consultation with the tenants and the local government, that the 
property is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments under 
such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of: (1) the 
costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and all available 
Federal, State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under 
section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and 
Affordability Act of 1997 (``MAHRAA''); and (2) environmental 
conditions that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the 
Secretary may, in consultation with the tenants of that property, 
contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or 
owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other rental 
assistance. The Secretary shall report semi-annually on all properties 
covered by this section that are assessed through the Real Estate 
Assessment Center and have physical inspection scores of less than 30 
or have consecutive physical inspection scores of less than 60. The 
report shall include--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the enforcement actions being taken to address 
        such conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties 
        and termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have 
        such conditions multiple times; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) actions that the Department of Housing and 
        Urban Development is taking to protect tenants of such 
        identified properties.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

used by any public housing agency for any amount of salary, including 
bonuses, for the chief executive officer of which, or any other

other entity selected to receive a grant award is announced by the

for mortgage foreclosure mitigation activities, under the following 
terms and conditions:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation 
        (NRC) shall make grants to counseling intermediaries approved 
        by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with 
        match to be determined by NRC based on affordability and the 
        economic conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by 
        NRC based on the aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage 
        foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas 
        with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate 
        the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied 
        single-family homes that are at risk of such foreclosure. Other 
        than areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures, grants 
        may also be provided to approved counseling intermediaries 
        based on a geographic analysis of the Nation by NRC which 
        determines where there is a prevalence of mortgages that are 
        risky and likely to fail, including any trends for mortgages 
        that are likely to default and face foreclosure. A State 
        Housing Finance Agency may also be eligible where the State 
        Housing Finance Agency meets all the requirements under this 
        paragraph. A HUD-approved counseling intermediary shall meet 
        certain mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance counseling 
        requirements, as determined by NRC, and shall be approved by 
        HUD or NRC as meeting these requirements.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance 
        shall only be made available to homeowners of owner-occupied 
        homes with mortgages in default or in danger of default. These 
        mortgages shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and 
        homeowners will be provided such assistance that shall consist 
        of activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and 
        result in the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained 
        pursuant to such activity or another positive outcome for the 
        homeowner. No funds made available under this paragraph may be 
        provided directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge 
        outstanding mortgage balances or for any other direct debt 
        reduction payments.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation 
        assistance by approved counseling intermediaries and State

                the Secretary and provided there is no increase in the 
                project-based assistance budget authority.
            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically

        (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project resulting from 
        additional financing obtained by the owner shall be subordinate 
        to any FHA-insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed on, 
        such project by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may 
        waive this requirement upon determination that such a waiver is

        projects.
            (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of

        the existing use restrictions.
            (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in 
        section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as 
        amended) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent that

    Sec. 215.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in fiscal

is owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, and during the process of foreclosure on any property with 
a contract for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the Secretary 
shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached 
to any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the Secretary 
determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 
524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 
1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in 
consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for project-
based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other 
existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The 
Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that project-
based contracts remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the 
exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety after written 
notice to and informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
available remedies, such as partial abatements or receivership. After 
disposition of any multifamily property described under this section, 
the contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall be 
subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
    Sec. 216.  The commitment authority funded by fees as provided 
under the heading ``Community Development Loan Guarantees Program 
Account'' may be used to guarantee, or make commitments to guarantee, 
notes, or other obligations issued by any State on behalf of non-
entitlement communities in the State in accordance with the 
requirements of section 108 of the Housing and Community Development 
Act of 1974:  Provided, That any State receiving such a guarantee or 
commitment shall distribute all funds subject to such guarantee to the

received the commitment.
    Sec. 217.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 or 
fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any asset

Development in connection with the operating fund rule:  Provided, That 
an agency seeking a discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the 
operating fund formula shall not be exempt from asset management 
requirements.
    Sec. 218.  With respect to the use of amounts provided in this Act 
and in future Acts for the operation, capital improvement and 
management of public housing as authorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of 
the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the 
Secretary shall not impose any requirement or guideline relating to 
asset management that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital 
funds for central office costs pursuant to section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  
Provided, That a public housing agency may not use capital funds 
authorized under section 9(d) for activities that are eligible under 
section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the operating fund in 
excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2).
    Sec. 219.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such 
allotment holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control procedures and directives. 
The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained 
allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the accounts ``Executive 
Offices'' and ``Administrative Support Offices,'' as well as each 
account receiving appropriations for ``Program Office Salaries and 
Expenses'', ``Government National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of 
Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and 
``Office of Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.
    Sec. 220.  The Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development shall, for fiscal year 2016 and subsequent fiscal years, 
notify the public through the Federal Register and other means, as 
determined appropriate, of the issuance of a notice of the availability 
of assistance or notice of funding availability (NOFA) for any program 
or discretionary fund administered by the Secretary that is to be 
competitively awarded. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for 
fiscal year 2016 and subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary may make 
the NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate Government 
Web site or through other electronic media, as determined by the 
Secretary.
    Sec. 221.  Payment of attorney fees in program-related litigation 
shall be paid from the individual program office and Office of General 
Counsel salaries and expenses appropriations. The annual budget 
submission for the program offices and the Office of General Counsel 
shall include any such projected litigation costs for attorney fees as 
a separate line item request. No funds provided in this title may be

Development is authorized to transfer up to 5 percent or $5,000,000, 
whichever is less, of the funds appropriated for any office funded 
under the heading ``Administrative Support Offices'' to any other 
office funded under such heading:  Provided, That no appropriation for 
any office funded under the heading ``Administrative Support Offices'' 
shall be increased or decreased by more than 5 percent or $5,000,000, 
whichever is less, without prior written approval of the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations:  Provided further, That the 
Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 5 percent or $5,000,000, 
whichever is less, of the funds appropriated for any account funded 
under the general heading ``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'' to 
any other account funded under such heading:  Provided further, That no

``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'' shall be increased or 
decreased by more than 5 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, 
without prior written approval of the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations:  Provided further, That the Secretary may transfer 
funds made available for salaries and expenses between any office 
funded under the heading ``Administrative Support Offices'' and any 
account funded under the general heading ``Program Office Salaries and 
Expenses'', but only with the prior written approval of the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations.

                days that all deficiencies have been corrected; or
                    (B) receives consecutive scores of less than 60 on 
                REAC inspections.
Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with 
assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but do not apply to such units 
assisted under section 8(o)(13) (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public 
housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under section 9 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
    (b) The Secretary shall take the following required actions as 
authorized under subsection (a)--
            (1) The Secretary shall notify the owner and provide an 
        opportunity for response within 30 days. If the violations 
        remain, the Secretary shall develop a Compliance, Disposition 
        and Enforcement Plan within 60 days, with a specified timetable 
        for correcting all deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide 
        notice of the Plan to the owner, tenants, the local government,

            (2) At the end of the term of the Compliance, Disposition 
        and Enforcement Plan, if the owner fails to fully comply with 
        such plan, the Secretary may require immediate replacement of 
        project management with a management agent approved by the 
        Secretary, and shall take one or more of the following actions, 
        and provide additional notice of those actions to the owner and

                    (A) impose civil money penalties;
                    (B) abate the section 8 contract, including partial 
                abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all

                requiring the owner to cure all project deficiencies.
    (c) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of 
contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for 
imminent major threats to health and safety after written notice to and 
informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set 
forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 
524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 
1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in 
consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for project-
based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other 
existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The 
Secretary shall report semi-annually on all properties covered by this 
section that are assessed through the Real Estate Assessment Center and 
have physical inspection scores of less than 30 or have consecutive

        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have 
        such conditions multiple times; and

        that follows through the period at the end and inserting 
        ``September 30, 2016.''.
    Sec. 228.  None of the funds in this Act provided to the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development may be used to make a grant award 
unless the Secretary notifies the House and Senate Committees on

                year 2016 or any fiscal year thereafter from the

                that are eligible under subsection (d) for assistance 
                with amounts from the Capital Fund, but only if the

    Sec. 238.  Section 526 (12 U.S.C. 1735f-4) of the National Housing

    Sec. 239.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall 
increase, pursuant to this section, the number of Moving-to-Work 
agencies authorized under section 204, title II, of the Departments of 
Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (Public Law 104-134; 110 Stat. 1321) 
by adding to the program 300 public housing agencies that are 
designated as high performing agencies under the Public Housing 
Assessment System (PHAS). No public housing agency shall be granted 
this designation through this section that administers in excess of 
22,000 aggregate housing vouchers and public housing units. Of the 
agencies selected under this section, no less than 150 shall administer 
600 or fewer aggregate housing voucher and public housing units, no 
less than 125 shall administer 601-5,000 aggregate housing voucher and 
public housing units, and no more than 20 shall administer 5,001-22,000 
aggregate housing voucher and public housing units. Of the 300 agencies 
selected under this section, five shall be agencies with portfolio 
awards under the Rental Assistance Demonstration that meet the other 
requirements of this section. Selection of agencies under this section 
shall be based on ensuring the geographic diversity of Moving-to-Work 
agencies. The Secretary may, at the request of a Moving-to-Work agency 
and one or more adjacent public housing agencies in the same area, 
designate that Moving-to-Work agency as a regional agency. A regional 
Moving-to-Work agency may administer the assistance under sections 8 
and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f and g) 
for the participating agencies within its region pursuant to the terms 
of its Moving-to-Work agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary may 
agree to extend the term of the agreement and to make any necessary 
changes to accommodate regionalization. A Moving-to-Work agency may be 
selected as a regional agency if the Secretary determines that unified 
administration of assistance under sections 8 and 9 by that agency 
across multiple jurisdictions will lead to efficiencies and to greater 
housing choice for low-income persons in the region. For purposes of 
this expansion, in addition to the provisions of the Act retained in 
section 204, section 8(r)(1) of the Act shall continue to apply unless 
the Secretary determines that waiver of this section is necessary to 
implement comprehensive rent reform and occupancy policies subject to 
evaluation by the Secretary, and the waiver contains, at a minimum, 
exceptions for requests to port due to employment, education, health 
and safety. No public housing agency granted this designation through 
this section shall receive more funding under sections 8 or 9 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 than it otherwise would have received 
absent this designation. The Secretary shall extend the current Moving-
to-Work agreements of previously designated participating agencies 
until the end of each such agency's fiscal year 2028 under the same 
terms and conditions of such current agreements, except for any changes 
to such terms or conditions otherwise mutually agreed upon by the 
Secretary and any such agency and such extension agreements shall 
prohibit any statutory offset of any reserve balances equal to four 
months of operating expenses. Any such reserve balances that exceed 
such amount shall remain available to any such agency for all 
permissible purposes under such agreement unless subject to a statutory 
offset. In addition to other reporting requirements, all Moving-to-Work 
agencies shall report financial data to the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development as specified by the Secretary, so that the effect of 
Moving-to-Work policy changes can be measured.
    Sec. 240.  Section 3(a) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 
(42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(6) Reviews of family income.--
                    ``(A) Frequency.--Reviews of family income for 
                purposes of this section shall be made--
                            ``(i) in the case of all families, upon the 
                        initial provision of housing assistance for the

                            ``(ii) no less than annually thereafter,
