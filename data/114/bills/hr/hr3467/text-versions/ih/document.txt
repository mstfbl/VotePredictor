                                 A BILL


 
To establish a pilot program to train public housing residents as home 
health aides and in home-based health services to enable such residents 
 to provide covered home-based health services to residents of public 
  housing and residents of federally-assisted rental housing, who are 
             elderly and disabled, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Together We Care Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The ``baby boom'' generation will require health care 
        attention that will exceed the current supply of health care 
        providers.
            (2) There is a shortage of training programs specializing 
        in health care and long-term services that focus on home care 
        instead of institutionalized care.
            (3) Although the need for home-based health services 
        transcends all income levels, the availability of such services 
        is more limited for residents of public housing.
            (4) Estimates indicate that there are 39.8 million 
        caregivers in the United States providing unpaid care to at 
        least one adult.
            (5) Of working persons providing unpaid care, 6 out of 
        every 10 have had to make adjustments to work schedules or 
        leave employment.
            (6) Many low-income families in the United States are 
        placed in an untenable position of choosing between work and 
        caregiving responsibilities at home.
            (7) Many residents of public housing in the United States 
        are aging and in need of care.
            (8) The Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        estimates the percentage of households assisted by the 
        Department that are elderly households is 33 percent.
            (9) Households that include a member who is a person with 
        disabilities comprise 21 percent of households living in public 
        housing.
            (10) New service programs are needed to provide home-based 
        health services to residents of public housing and to provide 
        job training and job placement for persons receiving assistance 
        from the Department of Housing and Urban Development needing 
        employment.
            (11) The Department of Housing and Urban Development should 
        establish a home-based health services pilot program to meet 
        the challenges of the increasing number of elderly persons and 
        persons with disabilities in public housing, which would 
        simultaneously create an opportunity to train job seekers in a 
        trade that provides home-based health services.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to give flexibility to the Department of Housing and 
        Urban Development and other entities to establish training 
        programs in home-based health services for public housing 
        residents; and
            (2) to provide needed home care options to elderly and 
        disabled public housing residents (including elderly and 
        disabled veterans who are public housing residents) and elderly 
        and disabled residents of federally-assisted rental housing to 
        allow them to remain in their homes and their communities.

SEC. 3. PILOT GRANT PROGRAM TO TRAIN PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS TO 
              PROVIDE COVERED HOME-BASED HEALTH SERVICES.
