SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reclamation of War Powers Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND POLICY.

    (a) It is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the intent of the 
Framers of the Constitution of the United States and ensure that the 
collective judgment of both Congress and the President will apply to 
the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or 
into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly 
indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces 
in hostilities or in such situations.
    (b) Under article I, section 8, of the Constitution, it is 
specifically provided that Congress shall have the power to make all 
laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution, not only its own 
powers but also all other powers vested by the Constitution in the 
Government of the United States, or in any department or officer 
thereof.
    (c) The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-
Chief to deploy United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into 
situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly 
indicated by the circumstances, may be exercised only pursuant to--
            (1) a declaration of war;
            (2) specific statutory authorization; or
            (3) a national emergency created by attack or imminent 
        threat of attack upon the United States, its territories or 
        possessions, or its armed forces.

SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS.

    (a) Limitation.--
            (1) In general.--No funds available for the United States 
        Armed Forces may be obligated or expended for introduction of 
        the Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where 
        imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the 
        circumstances, in the absence of--
                    (A) a declaration of war;
                    (B) specific statutory authorization; or
                    (C) a national emergency created by an attack or 
                imminent threat of attack upon the United States, its 
                territories or possessions, or the Armed Forces.
            (2) Additional limitation relating to national emergency.--
        Funds available for the United States Armed Forces may be 
        obligated or expended for introduction of the Armed Forces into 
        hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in 
        hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, by 
        reason of a national emergency created by an attack or imminent 
        threat of attack upon the United States, its territories or 
        possessions, or the Armed Forces only during the 60-day period 
        beginning on such date of introduction of the Armed Forces.
    (b) Prohibition on Consideration of Bill or Joint Resolution in 
Violation of Subsection (a).--
            (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
        Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill or joint 
        resolution that would make funds available in violation of 
        subsection (a).
            (2) Enactment as exercise of rulemaking power of house of 
        representatives and senate.--This subsection is enacted by 
        Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, 
                and as such are deemed a part of the rules of each 
                House, respectively, and such procedures supersede 
                other rules only to the extent that they are 
                inconsistent with such other rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the
