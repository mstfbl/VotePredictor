SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. ACTS AFFECTING A PERSONAL FINANCIAL INTEREST OF THE PRESIDENT 
              OR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 208 the following:
``Sec. 208A. Acts affecting a personal financial interest of the 
              President or Vice President of the United States
    ``(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being 
the President or Vice President of the United States, participates 
personally and substantially, through decision, approval, disapproval, 
recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, 
in a judicial or other proceeding, application, request for a ruling or 
other determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, 
arrest, or other particular matter in which, to their knowledge, the 
President or Vice President of the United States, their spouse, child, 
general partner, organization in which they are serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom they are negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
    ``(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply--
            ``(1) if the financial interest that would be affected by 
        the particular matter involved is held in a qualified blind 
        trust as defined by subsection (g); or
            ``(2) if the President or Vice President of the United 
        States first advises the Director of the Office of Government 
        Ethics of the nature and circumstances of the judicial or other 
        proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other 
        determination, contract, claim, controversy, charge, 
        accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
        disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a 
        written determination made by the Director of the Office of 
        Government Ethics that the interest is not so substantial as to 
        be deemed likely to affect the actions of the President or Vice 
        President or undermine the public's confidence in the integrity 
        of their office.
    ``(c) In the event that a national emergency necessitates the 
President or Vice President taking any immediate action that affects 
their personal financial interests prior to receiving an exemption 
under subsection (b)(2), the President or Vice President shall, in 
addition to the information required by subsection (b)(2), notify the 
Director of the Office of Government Ethics of the circumstances 
requiring action to be taken prior to the receipt of an exemption and 
shall make a retroactive request for an exemption under subsection 
(b)(2) within 48 hours of taking the action. The Director of the Office 
of Government Ethics shall then make a written determination as to 
whether an exemption under subsection (b)(2) would have been issued had 
the President or Vice President requested an exemption prior to taking 
the action. Should the Director of the Office of Government Ethics 
determine that an exemption would not have been granted, the President 
or Vice President shall, to the extent practicable, return, repay, 
remit, or refund any benefit gained as a result of that action. Any 
financial gains that cannot be repaid shall be gifted to reduce the 
public debt pursuant to section 3113 of title 31, United States Code.
    ``(d) The Director of the Office of Government Ethics shall 
complete the written determination required under subsection (b)(2) and 
subsection (c) as soon as practicable, but in no event shall the 
determination be made later than 10 days following a request for an 
exemption. Any request for exemption under subsection (b)(2) and 
subsection (c) not receiving a written determination within 10 days 
will be deemed to have been denied.
    ``(e) A copy of any request for an exemption and a copy of any 
determination made in response to a request for an exemption, including 
exemptions under subsection (b)(2) or (c) and any determination deemed 
to have been denied under subsection (d), shall be made available to 
the public by the Office of Government Ethics within 10 days of the 
receipt of a request for an exemption pursuant to procedures set forth 
in section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. In making such 
determination available, the agency may withhold from disclosure any 
information contained in the determination that would be exempt from 
disclosure under section 552 of title 5.
    ``(f) A violation of subsection (a) shall constitute a high crime 
and misdemeanor for the purposes of article II, section 4 of the United 
States Constitution.
    ``(g) For the purposes of this section, the term `qualified blind 
trust' shall include any trust in which the President or Vice President 
of the United States, their spouse, or any child has a beneficial 
interest in the principal or income, and which meets the following 
requirements:

                quarter with respect to the total cash value of the

                necessary to enable the interested party to complete an 
                individual tax return required by law, but such report

                consist of requests for distributions of cash or other

                interest in maximizing income or long-term capital 
                gain), (ii) to the notification of a trustee of a law 
                or regulation subsequently applicable to the reporting 
                individual which prohibits the interested party from 
                holding an asset, which notification directs that the 
                asset not be held by the trust, or (iii) to directions 
                to the trustee to sell all of an asset initially placed 
                in the trust by an interested party which in the 
                determination of the reporting individual creates a 
                conflict of interest or the appearance thereof due to 
                the subsequent assumption of duties by the reporting 
                individual; and
                    ``(G) the interested parties shall make no effort 
                to obtain information with respect to the holdings of 
                the trust, including obtaining a copy of any trust tax 
                return filed or any information relating thereto except 
                as otherwise provided in this subsection.
            ``(4) The proposed trust instrument and the proposed 
        trustee are certified in writing by the Director of the Office 
        of Government Ethics to be in compliance with the requirements 
        of this section. The Director of the Office of Government 
        Ethics shall conduct an annual recertification of the trust 
        instrument and trustee to verify that they remain in compliance 
        with the requirements of this section. If at any time the

        Government Ethics shall notify the Committee on Oversight and 
        Government Reform of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
        Senate, and provide written notification to the interested 
        parties that they are no longer eligible for an exemption under 
        subsection (b)(1) until the trust instrument and trustee are 
        recertified.
            ``(5) For the purposes of this subsection, `interested 
        party' means the President or Vice President of the United 
        States, their spouse, and any child; `reporting individual' 
        means the President or Vice President of the United States;

        determined under regulations prescribed by the Office of 
        Government Ethics, is generally involved in their role as such 
        an advisor in the management or control of trusts.

        pursuant to subsection (g) shall be made available to the 
        public within 10 days of the certification or notification 
        being made.''.
