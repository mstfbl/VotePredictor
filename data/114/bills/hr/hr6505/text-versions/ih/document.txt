                                 A BILL


 
 To require that jurisdictions receiving Byrne JAG funds have in place 
   an independent civilian review board for the purpose of reviewing 
 allegations of brutality and civil rights violations made against law 
      enforcement officers of the law enforcement agency of that 
                             jurisdiction.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Andrew Joseph III Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Andrew Joseph III, a 14-year-old boy, was killed as he 
        tried to cross Interstate 4 after being ejected and transported 
        from the Florida State Fair in Tampa on February 7, 2014.
            (2) Andrew Joseph III, of Riverview, Florida, was stopped 
        by Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office deputies while 
        attending the Tampa Fairgrounds during the Florida State Fair's 
        annual Student Day.
            (3) It is believed that law enforcement officials 
        wrongfully identified Andrew Joseph III as a participant in an 
        unruly and violent stampede.
            (4) Andrew Joseph III was detained by law enforcement 
        officials, and eventually taken two miles from the fair by 
        patrol car and left unattended, in an unknown area, surrounded 
        by four major roads.
            (5) At no point during detainment, search, interrogation, 
        ejection, or transportation, were Andrew Joseph III's parents 
        contacted by any law enforcement official.
            (6) Dropped from the patrol car in an unfamiliar 
        neighborhood, Andrew was struck and killed by a car while 
        trying to cross Interstate 4.
            (7) Tragic incidents, like the death of Andrew Joseph III, 
        can be prevented if law enforcement knows that any acts of 
        brutality or civil rights violations are being monitored by 
        independent civilian review boards.
            (8) In the name of Andrew's bereaved parents and a deeply 
        saddened community, in the hope of avoiding any similar 
        calamity, and in recognition of the fundamental precept that 
        Black Lives Matter, independent civilian review boards will 
        provide important oversight to ensure that a tragedy such as 
        this never happens again.
