              RELATING TO 2016 LOUISIANA STORMS AND FLOODING.

    (a) In General.--Section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall not apply to any qualified Louisiana storm and flood 
distribution.
    (b) Aggregate Dollar Limitation.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the 
        aggregate amount of distributions received by an individual 
        which may be treated as qualified Louisiana storm and flood 
        distributions for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess 
        (if any) of--
                    (A) $100,000, over
                    (B) the aggregate amounts treated as qualified 
                Louisiana storm and flood distributions received by 
                such individual for all prior taxable years.
            (2) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a distribution to 
        an individual would (without regard to paragraph (1)) be a 
        qualified Louisiana storm and flood distribution, a plan shall 
        not be treated as violating any requirement of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 merely because the plan treats such 
        distribution as a qualified Louisiana storm and flood 
        distribution, unless the aggregate amount of such distributions 
        from all plans maintained by the employer (and any member of 
        any controlled group which includes the employer) to such 
        individual exceeds $100,000.
            (3) Controlled group.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the 
        term ``controlled group'' means any group treated as a single

        Louisiana storm and flood distribution may, at any time during 
        the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date on which 
        such distribution was received, make one or more contributions 
        in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such 
        distribution to an eligible retirement plan of which such 
        individual is a beneficiary and to which a rollover 
        contribution of such distribution could be made under section 
        402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of such 
        Code, as the case may be.
            (2) Treatment of repayments of distributions from eligible 
        retirement plans other than iras.--For purposes of such Code, 
        if a contribution is made pursuant to paragraph (1) with 
        respect to a qualified Louisiana storm and flood distribution 
        from an eligible retirement plan other than an individual 
        retirement plan, then the taxpayer shall, to the extent of the 
        amount of the contribution, be treated as having received the 
        qualified Louisiana storm and flood distribution in an eligible 
        rollover distribution (as defined in section 402(c)(4) of such 
        Code) and as having transferred the amount to the eligible 
        retirement plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer within 
        60 days of the distribution.
            (3) Treatment of repayments for distributions from iras.--
        For purposes of such Code, if a contribution is made pursuant 
        to paragraph (1) with respect to a qualified Louisiana storm 
        and flood distribution from an individual retirement plan (as 
        defined by section 7701(a)(37) of such Code), then, to the 
        extent of the amount of the contribution, the qualified 
        Louisiana storm and flood distribution shall be treated as a 
        distribution described in section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as 
        having been transferred to the eligible retirement plan in a 
        direct trustee to trustee transfer within 60 days of the 
        distribution.
    (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            (1) Qualified louisiana storm and flooding distribution.--
        Except as provided in subsection (b), the term ``qualified 
        Louisiana storm and flooding distribution'' means any 
        distribution from an eligible retirement plan made on or after 
        the applicable disaster date, to an individual whose principal 
        residence on or after such date, is located in the Louisiana

Louisiana Storm and Flooding Distributions.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of any qualified Louisiana 
        storm and flood distribution, unless the taxpayer elects not to 
        have this subsection apply for any taxable year, any amount 
        required to be included in gross income for such taxable year 
        shall be so included ratably over the 3-taxable-year period 
        beginning with such taxable year.
            (2) Special rule.--For purposes of paragraph (1), rules 
        similar to the rules of subparagraph (E) of section 408A(d)(3)
