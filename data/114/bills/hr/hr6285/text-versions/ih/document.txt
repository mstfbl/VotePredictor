                signed a rental agreement for accommodations in the 
                United States for the duration of the alien's stay in 
                the United States;
                    ``(E) is not inadmissible under section 212;

            ``(2) Spouse.--The spouse of an alien described in 
        paragraph (1) may be admitted under the same terms as the 
        principal alien if the spouse satisfies the requirements of 
        paragraph (1), other than subparagraph (D).
            ``(3) Immigrant intent.--In determining eligibility for 
        admission under this subsection, maintenance of a residence in

        the alien to abandon the alien's residence in Canada.
            ``(4) Period of admission.--During any single 365-day 
        period, an alien may be admitted as a visitor for pleasure

        for a period not to exceed 240 days, beginning on the date of 
        admission. Time spent outside of the United States during such 
        period of admission shall not be counted for purposes of 
        determining the termination date of such period.
            ``(5) Non-resident alien tax status.--Notwithstanding 
        section 7701(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, an alien 
        admitted pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a 
        nonresident alien for purposes the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986 (other than subtitle B thereof).''.
