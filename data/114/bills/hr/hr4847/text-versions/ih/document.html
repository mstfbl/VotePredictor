                                 A BILL


 
To repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act, Public Law 89-732, to provide that 
 certain Cuban entrants are ineligible to receive refugee assistance, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Correcting Unfair Benefits for 
Aliens Act of 2016'' or as the ``CUBA Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that Cuba 
        and the United States would reopen their embassies and restore 
        diplomatic ties.
            (2) Diplomatic relations between the two countries were 
        formally reestablished July 20, 2015, when the United States 
        and Cuba reopened their respective embassies.
            (3) The International Business Times reported on September 
        10, 2015, that ``Texas is on pace this year to set a new record 
        for the number of Cubans trying to enter the United States 
        through the Lone Star State, with about 60 percent more 
        migrants from the island nation making the trip in 2015 
        compared to one year before.''.
            (4) The Obama Administration has reestablished relations 
        with Cuba, and that, therefore, the special treatment Cuban 
        nationals receive under the Cuban Adjustment Act, the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act, the Cuban Family Reunification 
        Program and the Wet Foot/Dry Foot policy are no longer 
        applicable and fail the ``urgent humanitarian reasons'' and 
        ``significant public benefit'' tests.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Cuban 
nationals should be treated under the same immigration rules as 
nationals of other countries with which the United States has 
diplomatic relations and should not receive preferential treatment.

SEC. 3. REPEAL OF THE CUBAN ADJUSTMENT ACT.

    (a) Repeals of Relevant Statutes.--
            (1) Repeal of limitation on repeal of cuban adjustment 
        act.--Section 606 of title VI of division C of Public Law 104-
        208 is repealed.
            (2) Cuban adjustment act.--Public Law 89-732 is repealed.
