                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Portal-to-Portal 
Act of 1947 to prevent wage theft and assist in the recovery of stolen 
  wages, to authorize the Secretary of Labor to administer grants to 
       prevent wage and hour violations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wage Theft Prevention and Wage 
Recovery Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Wage theft occurs when an employer does not pay an 
        employee for work that the employee has performed, depriving 
        the worker of wages and earnings to which the worker is legally 
        entitled. This theft occurs in many forms, including by 
        employers violating minimum wage requirements, failing to pay 
        overtime compensation, requiring off-the-clock work, failing to 
        provide final payments, misclassifying employees as being 
        exempt from overtime compensation or as independent contractors 
        rather than as employees, and improperly withholding tips.
            (2) Wage theft poses a serious and growing problem across 
        industries for working individuals of the United States. Wage 
        theft is widespread and is estimated to cost workers more than 
        $8,600,000,000 per year. In certain industries, compliance with 
        Federal wage and hour laws is less than 50 percent.
            (3) Wage theft is closely associated with employment 
        discrimination, with women, immigrants, and minorities being 
        disproportionately affected. Women are significantly more 
        likely to experience minimum wage violations than men, foreign-
        born workers are nearly 2 times as likely to experience minimum 
        wage violations as their counterparts born in the United 
        States, and African-Americans are 3 times more likely to 
        experience minimum wage violations than their White 
        counterparts.
            (4) Wage theft is closely associated with unsafe working 
        conditions.
            (5) Wage theft--
                    (A) depresses the wages of working families who are 
                already struggling to make ends meet;
                    (B) strains social services funds;
                    (C) diminishes consumer spending power and hurts 
                local economies;
                    (D) reduces vital State and Federal tax revenues;
                    (E) places law-abiding employers at a competitive 
                disadvantage with noncompliant employers;
                    (F) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods; 
                and
                    (G) lowers labor standards throughout labor 
                markets.
            (6) Low-wage workers are at the greatest risk of suffering 
        from wage theft. A survey of 4,387 low-wage workers in New 
        York, Los Angeles, and Chicago found that 68 percent of the 
        workers surveyed had experienced some form of wage theft in the 
        workweek immediately before the survey was conducted. These 
        workers experienced a range of wage and hour violations: 26 
        percent of such workers were not paid minimum wage; 76 percent 
        of such workers who worked more than 40 hours in the workweek 
        immediately before the survey was conducted were not paid at 
        the overtime rate; and, in the year before the survey was 
        conducted, 43 percent of the workers who attempted to address 
        such issues by filing a complaint with their employer or who 
        attempted to form a labor organization experienced retaliation 
        by their employers, including by being fired, suspended, or 
        receiving threats of reductions in their hours or pay.
            (7) In 2012, State and Federal authorities as well as 
        private attorneys recovered at least $933,000,000 in wage theft 
        enforcement actions, which was nearly 3 times the value of all 
        bank robberies, residential robberies, convenience store and 
        gas station robberies, and street robberies in the United 
        States during that year.
            (8) A Department of Labor study of wage theft in California 
        and New York found that wage theft deprived workers of 37 
        percent to 49 percent of their income, pushing at least 15,000 
        families below the poverty line and driving another 50,000 to 
        100,000 families deeper into poverty.
            (9) A study analyzing wage theft claims in the State of 
        Washington from 2009 to 2013 estimated that the total economic 
        cost of wage theft to the State totaled more than $64,000,000 
        resulting from the lower economic activity and spending of low-
        wage workers due to their lost wages.
            (10) A Department of Labor study of wage violations in 
        California and New York found that wage theft deprived families 
        of $5,600,000 in possible earned income tax credits and 
        resulted in a $22,000,000 loss in State tax revenue, a 
        $238,000,000 loss in payroll tax revenue, and a $113,000,000 
        loss in Federal income tax revenue.
            (11) Barriers to addressing wage theft continue to exist 
        decades after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
        1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.). These barriers have resulted, in 
        significant part, because enforcement of such Act has not 
        worked as Congress originally intended and because many of the 
        provisions of such Act do not include sufficient penalties to 
        discourage violations. Improvements to enforcement and 
        amendments to such Act are necessary to ensure that such Act 
        provides effective protection to individuals subject to wage 
        theft.
            (12) The lack of a Federal right for employees to receive 
        full compensation at the agreed upon wage rate for all work 
        performed by the employee has resulted in workers being able to 
        recover only the applicable minimum wage, or the overtime rate 
        if applicable, when employers engage in wage theft.
            (13) The lack of a Federal requirement to provide employees 
        with paystubs indicating how their pay is calculated or to 
        allow employees to inspect their employers' payroll records 
        significantly impedes efforts to identify and challenge wage 
        theft.
            (14) The lack of a Federal requirement to pay employees 
        their final payments in a timely manner upon termination of the 
        employment relationship between the employer and employee has 
        led to unreasonable, and sometimes indefinite, delays in 
        compensation after an employment relationship ends.
            (15) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, as in effect 
        on the day before the date of enactment of this Act, require 
        employers to compensate employees at the minimum wage rate and 
        to provide overtime compensation when appropriate, the lack of 
        civil penalties for violations of these requirements has 
        dampened their effectiveness.
            (16) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, as in effect 
        on the day before the date of enactment of this Act, provide 
        employees who are subject to wage theft with the right to 
        unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation plus an 
        additional equal amount as liquidated damages, this low level 
        of damages has proved insufficient to deter employers from 
        stealing the wages of their employees.
            (17) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, as in effect 
        on the day before the date of enactment of this Act, require 
        employers to keep records of employees' pay, the lack of 
        remedies for this requirement diminishes the effectiveness of 
        the requirement.
            (18) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and 
        regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, as in effect 
        on the day before the date of enactment of this Act, provide 
        for limited criminal penalties when employers violate the 
        provisions of such Act, the Secretary of Labor rarely resorts 
        to these penalties, causing them to serve as a hollow threat.
            (19) The statute of limitations under section 6 of the 
        Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (29 U.S.C. 255), in effect on the 
        day before the date of enactment of this Act, precludes 
        employees from bringing claims for wage theft 2 years after the 
        cause of action accrued, or 3 years after the cause of action 
        accrued if the claim is with respect to a willful or repeat 
        violation by the employer. Additionally, the statute of 
        limitations is not suspended while the Secretary of Labor 
        investigates a complaint. These strict confines of the statute 
        of limitations sometimes result in employees being deprived of 
        their ability to institute a private lawsuit against their 
        employer in order to recover their stolen wages.
            (20) Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 
        (29 U.S.C. 216(b)), as in effect on the day before the date of 
        enactment of this Act, requires employees to affirmatively 
        ``opt-in'' in order to be a party plaintiff in a collective 
        action brought by another aggrieved employee seeking to recover 
        stolen wages in court. This provision limits the ability of 
        employees to unite and pursue private lawsuits against 
        employers.
            (21) Under the penalty structure of the Fair Labor 
        Standards Act of 1938, as in effect on the day before the date 
        of enactment of this Act, many employers who are caught 
        violating such Act continue to violate the Act. A Department of 
        Labor investigation found that one-third of employers who had 
        previously engaged in wage theft continued to do so.
            (22) The Government Accountability Office and the 
        Department of Labor have recognized that when employers are 
        assessed civil penalties, they are more likely to comply with 
        the law in the future and other employers in the same region--
        regardless of industry--are also more likely to comply with the 
        law.
            (23) States that have enacted legislation to address wage 
        theft by increasing the damages to which employees are entitled 
        following violations of wage and hour laws have positively 
        impacted the workers in such States. However, many States have 
        not enacted such legislation and, worse still, some States do 
        not have any laws protecting workers from wage theft or even 
        agencies to enforce workers' rights to compensation for work. 
        This discrepancy in State laws has resulted in a fragmentation 
        of workers' rights across the United States, with some workers 
        having a measure of protection from wage theft and other 
        workers being left extremely vulnerable to wage theft.
            (24) Effective enforcement of wage and hour laws is 
        critical to increasing compliance. Given the limited resources 
        available for enforcement, enhanced strategic enforcement of 
        Federal wage and hour laws is crucial.
            (25) For enhanced strategic enforcement to be effective, 
        government regulators must work with community stakeholders who 
        have direct knowledge of ongoing violations of Federal wage and 
        hour requirements and who are in a position to prevent such 
        violations.
            (26) Partnerships between regulators, workers, nonprofit 
        organizations, and businesses can increase compliance by 
        educating workers about their rights, collecting evidence, 
        reporting violations, identifying noncompliant employers, and 
        modeling good practices.
            (27) Partnerships between regulators, workers, nonprofit 
        organizations, and businesses have been successful in combating 
        wage theft. In 2006, the Division of Labor Standards 
        Enforcement of California created a janitorial enforcement team 
        to work closely with a local janitorial watchdog organization. 
        As of 2015, the partnership had resulted in countless 
        administrative, civil, and criminal actions against employers 
        and in the collection of more than $68,000,000 in back pay for 
        janitorial workers.
            (28) The Government Accountability Office has recommended 
        that the Department of Labor identify ways to leverage its 
        resources to better combat wage theft by improving services 
        provided through partnerships.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

                recovery;
                    (B) supporting individual entities and developing 
                community partnerships that expand and improve 
                cooperative efforts between enforcement agencies and 
                community-based organizations in the prevention of wage 
                and hour violations and enforcement of wage and hour 
                laws;
                    (C) expanding outreach to workers in industries or 
                geographic areas identified by the Secretary of Labor 
                as highly noncompliant with Federal wage and hour laws;
                    (D) improving detection of employers who are not 
                complying with such laws and aiding in the 
                identification of violations of such laws; and
                    (E) facilitating the collection of evidence to 
                assist enforcement efforts.

the employee regarding the specific number of hours worked by the 
employee for the employer for which the employee was not compensated 
and the wage rate for each of those hours is accurate. The employer may 
only overcome the rebuttable presumptions described in this subsection
