            ``(5) Occupancy by over-income families in certain public 
        housing.--
                    ``(A) Notice.--If a public housing agency 
                determines that a family residing in a dwelling unit in 
                public housing is an over-income family because of an 
                income review conducted under this subsection, the 
                public housing agency shall notify such family of that 
                determination.
                    ``(B) Termination of tenancy.--Within 30 days of 
                receipt of a notice described in subparagraph (A), an 
                over-income family residing in a dwelling unit in 
                public housing--
                            ``(i) may submit an appeal of determination 
                        that includes additional documentation that was 
                        not included during the income review to 
                        confirm eligibility for tenancy in public 
                        housing; or
                            ``(ii) shall vacate the dwelling unit.
                    ``(C) PHA appeals determination.--A public housing 
                agency shall review an appeal submitted under 
                subparagraph (B)(i) and notify the over-income family 
                about the results of an appeal within 30 days of 
                receipt of the appeal. If the public housing agency 
                finds in such review that the over-income family is 
                ineligible for tenancy in public housing, the family 
                shall vacate the dwelling unit within 30 days of 
                receipt of the results of an appeal.
                    ``(D) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, 
                the term `over-income family' means an individual or 
                family ineligible to reside in a dwelling unit in 
                public housing because such family is not a low-income 
                family at the time--
                            ``(i) an annual income review is conducted 
                        under paragraph (1); or
                            ``(ii) a review is conducted pursuant to 
                        paragraph (6).''.
