        an improvement to such property or a contribution to capital of 
        such corporation--
                    ``(A) such addition shall never be taken into 
                account under subsection (d)(1)(A) if the aggregate 
                amount thereof during the taxable year with respect to 
                such property or stock is less than $1,000, and
                    ``(B) such addition shall be treated as a separate 
                asset acquired at the close of such taxable year if the 
                aggregate amount thereof during the taxable year with 
                respect to such property or stock is $1,000 or more.
        A rule similar to the rule of the preceding sentence shall 
        apply to any other portion of an asset to the extent that 
        separate treatment of such portion is appropriate to carry out 
        the purposes of this section.
            ``(2) Assets which are not indexed assets throughout 
        holding period.--The applicable inflation adjustment shall be 
        appropriately reduced for periods during which the asset was 
        not an indexed asset.
            ``(3) Treatment of certain distributions.--A distribution 
        with respect to stock in a corporation which is not a dividend 
        shall be treated as a disposition.

        that (but for this paragraph) this section would create or 
        increase a net ordinary loss to which section 1231(a)(2) 
        applies or an ordinary loss to which any other provision of 
        this title applies, such provision shall not apply. The 
        taxpayer shall be treated as having a long-term capital loss in 
        an amount equal to the amount of the ordinary loss to which the 
        preceding sentence applies.
            ``(5) Acquisition date where there has been prior 
        application of subsection (a)(1) with respect to the 
        taxpayer.--If there has been a prior application of subsection 
        (a)(1) to an asset while such asset was held by the taxpayer, 
        the date of acquisition of such asset by the taxpayer shall be 
        treated as not earlier than the date of the most recent such 
        prior application.
    ``(i) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations 
as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this 
section.''.
