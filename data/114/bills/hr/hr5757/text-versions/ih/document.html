                single proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board may 
                not seek or recover in such proceeding a total monetary 
                recovery that exceeds the sum of $30,000, exclusive of 
                any attorneys' fees and costs that may be awarded under 
                section 1405(x)(2).

        proceeding where a party agrees to cease activity that is found 
        to be infringing, including removal or disabling of access to, 
        or destruction of, infringing materials, and such agreement is 
        reflected in the record, the Copyright Claims Board shall

    ``(a) Application or Certificate.--No claim or counterclaim 
alleging infringement of an exclusive right of copyright may be 
asserted before the Copyright Claims Board unless the owner of the 
copyright has first delivered a completed application, deposit and the 
required fee for registration to the Copyright Office and either a 
registration certificate has been issued or has not been refused.
    ``(b) Certificate of Registration.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, a claimant or counterclaimant in a proceeding before 
the Copyright Claims Board shall be eligible to recover actual damages 
and profits or limited statutory damages for infringement of a work 
under this chapter if the requirements of subsection (a) have been met: 
Provided, however, That--

        determination in the proceeding until a registration 
        certificate has been issued by the Copyright Office, submitted 
        to the Copyright Claims Board and made available to the other 
        parties to the proceeding, and the other parties have been 
        provided an opportunity to address it;

        outstanding registration certificate for the work, it shall be 
        held in abeyance pending submission of the certificate to the

        one year, the Copyright Claims Board may, upon providing 
        written notice to the parties and 30 days to respond, dismiss 
        the proceeding without prejudice; and
            ``(3) if the Copyright Claims Board receives notice that 
        registration has been refused by the Copyright Office, the 
        proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice.
    ``(c) Presumption.--Where a certificate shows that registration of 
a work was made before or within 5 years of its first publication, the 
presumption set forth in section 410(c) of this title shall apply in a 
proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board, in addition to relevant 
principles of law under this title.
``Sec. 1405. Conduct of proceedings
    ``(a) In General.--Proceedings of the Copyright Claims Board shall 
be conducted in accordance with this chapter and regulations as 
implemented by the Register of Copyrights, in addition to relevant 
principles of law under this title. To the extent it appears there may 
be conflicting judicial precedent on an issue of substantive copyright 
law that cannot be reconciled, the Copyright Claims Board shall follow 
the law of the Federal jurisdiction where the action could have been 
brought if filed in Federal district court, or, if it could have been 
brought in more than one jurisdiction, the jurisdiction that the 
Copyright Claims Board determines has the most significant ties to the 
parties and conduct at issue.
    ``(b) Record.--The Copyright Claims Board shall maintain records 
documenting the proceedings before it.
    ``(c) Centralized Process.--Proceedings before the Copyright Claims 
Board shall be conducted at the offices of the Copyright Claims Board

and shall take place by means of written submissions and hearings and 
conferences accomplished via Internet-based applications and other 
telecommunications facilities: Provided, however, That in cases where 
physical or other nontestimonial evidence material to a proceeding 
cannot be furnished to the Copyright Claims Board through available 
telecommunications facilities, the Copyright Claims Board shall have 
the discretion to make alternative arrangements for the submission of 
such evidence that do not prejudice another party to the proceeding.

Claims Board may, but is not required to be represented by--
            ``(1) an attorney; or
            ``(2) a law student who is qualified under applicable law 
        governing law students' representation of parties in legal 
        proceedings and who provides such representation on a pro bono 
        basis.
    ``(e) Commencement of Proceeding.--To commence a proceeding, a 
claimant shall, subject to such additional requirements as may be 
prescribed in regulations established by the Register of Copyrights, 
file a claim with the Copyright Claims Board, that--
            ``(1) includes a statement of material facts in support of 
        the claim;
            ``(2) is certified in accordance with subsection (x)(1); 
        and
            ``(3) is accompanied by a filing fee in such amount as may 
        be prescribed in regulations established by the Register of 
        Copyrights, which amount shall be at least $100, shall not

        court, and shall be established to further the goals of the 
        Copyright Claims Board.
    ``(f) Review of Claims and Counterclaims.--
            ``(1) Claims.--Upon filing, a claim shall be reviewed by a 
        Copyright Claims Attorney to ensure that it complies with 
        applicable regulations and this chapter, including the 
        following:
                    ``(A) If the claim is found to comply, the claimant 
                shall be so notified and instructed to proceed with 
                service of the claim as provided in subsection (g).
                    ``(B) If the claim is found not to comply, the 
                claimant shall be notified that the claim is deficient 
                and permitted to file an amended claim within 30 days 
                of the date of such notice without the requirement of 
                an additional filing fee. If the claimant files a 
                compliant claim within that period, he or she shall be 
                so notified and instructed to proceed with service of 
                the claim. If the claim is refiled within the 30-day 
                period but still fails to comply, the claimant will 
                again be notified that the claim is deficient and 
                provided a second opportunity to amend it within 30 
                days without the requirement of an additional filing 
                fee. If the claim is refiled again within the second 
                30-day period and is compliant, the claimant shall be 
                so notified and instructed to proceed with service, but 
                if the claim still fails to comply, upon confirmation 
                of its noncompliance by a Copyright Claims Officer, the 
                proceeding shall be dismissed without prejudice. The 
                Copyright Claims Board shall also dismiss without 
                prejudice any proceeding in which a compliant claim is 
                not filed within the applicable 30-day time period.

                against an online service provider for infringement by 
                reason of storage of or referral or linking to 
                infringing material that may be subject to the 
                limitations on liability set forth in section 512(b), 
                section 512(c) or section 512(d) of this title, shall 
                be considered noncompliant unless the claimant affirms 
                in the statement required under subsection (e)(1) of 
                this section that he or she has previously notified the 
                service provider of the claimed infringement in 
                accordance with section 512(b)(2)(E), section 512(c)(3) 
                or section 512(d)(3) of this title, as applicable, and 
                the service provider failed to remove or disable access 
                to the material expeditiously upon the provision of 
                such notice: Provided, however, That if a claim is 
                found to be noncompliant under this subparagraph, the 
                Copyright Claims Board shall provide the claimant with 
                information concerning the service of such a notice 
                pursuant to the relevant provision of this title.
            ``(2) Counterclaims.--Upon filing and service of a 
        counterclaim, the counterclaim shall be reviewed by a Copyright 
        Claims Attorney to ensure that it complies with the provisions 
        of this chapter and applicable regulations. If the counterclaim 
        is found not to comply, the counterclaimant and other parties 
        shall be notified that it is deficient and the counterclaimant 
        permitted to file and serve an amended counterclaim within 30 
        days of the date of such notice. If the counterclaimant files 
        and serves a compliant counterclaim within that period, the 
        counterclaimant and other parties shall be so notified. If the 
        counterclaim is refiled and served within the 30-day period but 
        still fails to comply, the counterclaimant and other parties 
        will again be notified that it is deficient and the 
        counterclaimant provided a second opportunity to amend it 
        within 30 days. If the counterclaim is refiled and served again 
        within the second 30-day period and is compliant, the 
        counterclaimant and parties shall be so notified, but if the 
        counterclaim still fails to comply, upon confirmation of its 
        noncompliance by a Copyright Claims Officer, the counterclaim, 
        but not the proceeding, shall be dismissed without prejudice.
            ``(3) Dismissal for good cause.--The Copyright Claims Board 
        shall dismiss a proceeding without prejudice if, upon reviewing 
        a claim or counterclaim, or at any other time in a proceeding, 
        the Copyright Claims Board concludes that it is unsuitable for 
        determination by the Copyright Claims Board, including due to 
        the following:
                    ``(A) The failure to join a necessary party.
                    ``(B) The lack of an essential witness, evidence, 
                or expert testimony.

                fact that could exceed the competence of the Copyright 
                Claims Board.

against a respondent, a claimant must within 90 days of receiving 
notification to proceed with service file proof of service on the 
respondent with the Copyright Claims Board. To effectuate service on a 
respondent, the claimant must cause notice of the proceeding and a copy 
of the claim to be served on the respondent, either by personal service 
or pursuant to a waiver of personal service, as prescribed in 
regulations established by the Register of Copyrights. Such regulations 
shall include the following requirements and conditions:

        prescribed form and shall set forth the nature of the Copyright 
        Claims Board and proceeding, the respondent's right to opt out,

        including a prominent statement that, by not opting out within 
        the 30-day period, the respondent--
                    ``(A) will forgo the opportunity to have the 
                dispute decided by a court created under article III of

service has been filed by the claimant and the respondent does not 
submit an opt-out notice to the Copyright Claims Board within 30 days 
of service, the proceeding shall be deemed an active proceeding and the 
respondent shall be bound by the result to the extent provided under

                Claims Board;
                    ``(B) be in writing, and include an explanation of 
                the factual and legal basis of the decision therein;

                terms by which a respondent or counterclaim respondent

                other relief awarded, including pursuant to

        from a decision contained in a determination may append a 
        statement setting forth the grounds for his or her dissent.
            ``(3) Publication.--Final determinations of the Copyright 
        Claims Board shall be made available on a publicly accessible 
        website with other records to be made available to the public 
        in accordance with law: Provided, however, That such records 
        may be redacted by the Copyright Claims Board to protect 
        confidential information that is the subject of a protective 
        order under subsection (m)(2).
    ``(t) Respondent's Default.--Where a proceeding has been deemed an 
active proceeding but the respondent has failed to appear or has ceased 
participating in the proceeding, as demonstrated by his or her failure 
to meet one or more deadlines or requirements set forth in the schedule 
adopted by the Copyright Claims Board pursuant to subsection (j) 
without justifiable cause, the Copyright Claims Board may enter a 
default determination, including the dismissal of any counterclaim 
asserted by a respondent, as follows and in accordance with such other 
requirements as the Register of Copyrights may prescribe by regulation:
            ``(1) The Copyright Claims Board shall require the claimant 
        to submit relevant evidence and other information in support of 
        his or her claim and any asserted damages and, upon review of 
        such evidence and any other requested submissions from the 
        claimant, shall determine whether the materials so submitted 
        are sufficient to support a finding in favor of the claimant 
        under applicable law and, if so, the appropriate relief and 
        damages, if any, to be awarded.
            ``(2) If the claimant has met his or her burden under 
        paragraph (1), the Copyright Claims Board shall prepare a 
        proposed default determination and provide written notice to 
        the respondent at all addresses, including email addresses, 
        reflected in the records of the proceeding before the Copyright 
        Claims Board, concerning the pendency of a default 
        determination by the Copyright Claims Board and the legal 
        significance of such determination. Such notice shall be 
        accompanied by the proposed default determination and provide 
        that the respondent has 30 days from the date of the notice to 
        submit any evidence or other information in opposition to the 
        proposed default determination.
            ``(3) If the respondent responds to the notice provided 
        under paragraph (2) within the 30-day period, the Copyright 
        Claims Board shall consider respondent's submissions and, after 
        allowing the other parties to address such submissions, 
        maintain or amend its proposed determination as appropriate, 
        and the resulting determination shall not be a default 
        determination.
            ``(4) If the respondent fails to respond to the notice 
        provided under paragraph (2), the Copyright Claims Board shall 
        proceed to issue the default determination as a final 
        determination. Thereafter, the respondent may only challenge 
        such determination to the extent permitted under section 
        1407(c): Provided, however, That prior to the initiation of any 
        additional proceedings under section 1407, the Copyright Claims 
        Board shall have the discretion to vacate the default 
        determination in the interests of justice.
    ``(u) Claimant's Failure To Proceed.--
            ``(1) Failure to complete service.--If a claimant fails to 
        complete service on a respondent within the 90-day period as 
        prescribed in subsection (g), that respondent shall be 
        dismissed from the proceeding without prejudice; and if a 
        claimant fails to complete service on all respondents within 
        the 90-day period, the proceeding shall be dismissed by the 
        Copyright Claims Board without prejudice.
            ``(2) Failure to prosecute.--If a claimant fails to proceed 
        in an active proceeding, as demonstrated by his or her failure 
        to meet one or more deadlines or requirements set forth in the 
        schedule adopted by the Copyright Claims Board pursuant to 
        subsection (j) without justifiable cause, the Copyright Claims 
        Board may, upon providing written notice to the claimant and 30 
        days to respond, issue a determination dismissing the 
        claimants' claims, which shall include an award of attorneys' 
        fees and costs if appropriate under subsection (x)(2). 
        Thereafter, the claimant may only challenge such determination 
        to the extent permitted under section 1407(c): Provided, 
        however, That prior to the initiation of any additional 
        proceedings under section 1407, the Copyright Claims Board 
        shall have the discretion to vacate the determination of 
        dismissal in the interests of justice.
    ``(v) Reconsideration.--A party may, within 30 days of the date of 
issuance of a final determination by the Copyright Claims Board, submit 
a written request for reconsideration of, or an amendment to, such 
determination if the party identifies a clear error of law or fact 
material to the outcome, or a technical mistake. After providing the 
other parties an opportunity to address such request, the Copyright 
Claims Board shall respond by denying the request or issuing an amended 
final determination.
    ``(w) Review by Register.--A party who has been denied 
reconsideration by the Copyright Claims Board may, within 30 days of 
the date of such denial, request review by the Register of Copyrights 
in accordance with regulations established by the Register of 
Copyrights, which regulations shall provide for a reasonable filing 
fee. The Register's review shall be limited to consideration of whether 
the Copyright Claims Board abused its discretion in denying 
reconsideration. After providing the other parties an opportunity to 
address the request, the Register shall respond by denying the request 
or remanding the proceeding to the Copyright Claims Board for 
reconsideration of identified issues and issuance of an amended final 
determination, which amended final determination shall not be subject 
to further consideration or review other than pursuant to section 
1407(c).
    ``(x) Conduct of Parties and Attorneys.--
            ``(1) Certification.--The Register of Copyrights shall 
        establish regulations concerning certification of the accuracy 
        and truthfulness of statements made by participants in 
        proceedings before the Copyright Claims Board.
            ``(2) Bad faith conduct.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, in any proceeding in which a determination is 
        rendered and--
                    ``(A) it is established that a party pursued a 
                claim, counterclaim or defense for a harassing or other 
                improper purpose, or without reasonable basis in law or 
                fact; or
                    ``(B) the claimant's claim is dismissed for failure 
                to prosecute pursuant to subsection (u)(2),
        unless inconsistent with the interests of justice, the 
        Copyright Claims Board shall in such determination award 
        reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to any adversely affected 
        party or parties in a total amount not to exceed $5,000: 
        Provided, however, That if an adversely affected party appeared 
        pro se in the proceeding, the award to that party shall be of 
        costs only and no more than $2,500.
``Sec. 1406. Effect of proceeding
    ``(a) Determination.--Subject to the reconsideration and review 
processes afforded by section 1405(v) and 1405(w), respectively, and 
section 1407(c), the rendering of a final determination by the 
Copyright Claims Board in a proceeding, including a default 
determination or determination based on failure to prosecute, shall, 
solely with respect to the parties to such determination, preclude 
relitigation before any court or tribunal, or before the Copyright 
Claims Board, of the claims and counterclaims asserted and finally 
determined by such determination, and may be relied upon for such 
purpose in a future action or proceeding arising from the same specific 
activity or activities: Provided, however, That--

        not preclude litigation or relitigation as between the same or 
        different parties before any court or tribunal, or the 
        Copyright Claims Board, of the same or similar issues of fact 
        or law in connection with claims or counterclaims not asserted 
        and finally determined by the determination of the Copyright

        effect, in any other action or proceeding before any other 
        court or tribunal, including the Copyright Claims Board; and
            ``(3) except to the extent permitted in this subsection and 
        section 1407, no determination of the Copyright Claims Board 
        shall be cited or relied upon as legal precedent in any other 
        action or proceeding before any court or tribunal, including 
        the Copyright Claims Board.
    ``(b) Other Materials in Proceeding.--Except as permitted under 
this section and section 1407, a submission or statement of a party or 
witness made in connection with a proceeding before the Copyright 
Claims Board, including a proceeding that is dismissed, shall not be 
cited or relied upon in, or serve as the basis of, any action or 
proceeding concerning rights or limitations on rights under this title 
before any court or tribunal, including the Copyright Claims Board.
    ``(c) With Respect to Section 512(g).--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, the commencement of a proceeding by a claimant before 
the Copyright Claims Board against a subscriber of a service provider 
that seeks a declaration of infringement concerning material that has 
been removed or to which access has been disabled by the service 
provider in response to a notification of claimed infringement by the 
claimant pursuant to section 512(c)(1)(C) of this title shall be a 
basis to preclude the replacement of such material by the service 
provider pursuant to section 512(g) of this title if notice of the 
commencement of the Copyright Claims Board proceeding is provided by 
the claimant to the service provider's designated agent not less than 
10 nor more than 14 business days following receipt of a counter 
notification by the service provider pursuant to section 512(g) of this 
title.
    ``(d) Failure To Assert Counterclaim.--The failure or inability to 
assert a counterclaim in a proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board 
shall not preclude its assertion in a subsequent court action or 
proceeding before the Copyright Claims Board.
    ``(e) Opt-Out or Dismissal of Party.--If a party has timely opted 
out of a proceeding under section 1405(h) or is dismissed from a 
proceeding prior to the issuance of a final determination by the 
Copyright Claims Board, the determination shall not be binding upon and 
shall have no preclusive effect with respect to that party.
``Sec. 1407. Review and confirmation by district court
    ``(a) In General.--In any proceeding in which a party has failed to 
pay monies as required or otherwise comply with the relief awarded in a 
final determination of the Copyright Claims Board, including a default 
determination or a determination based on failure to prosecute, the 
aggrieved party may, within one year of the issuance of such final 
determination, resolution of any reconsideration by the Copyright 
Claims Board or review by the Register of Copyrights, or issuance of an 
amended final determination, whichever occurs last, apply to the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order 
confirming the final relief awarded and reducing such award to 
judgment. The court shall grant such order and direct entry of judgment 
unless the determination is or has been vacated, modified or corrected 
as permitted under subsection (c).

    Not later than 3 years after the issuance of the first 
determination by the Copyright Claims Board, the Register of Copyrights 
shall deliver a study to Congress that addresses--
            (1) the use and efficacy of the Copyright Claims Board in 
        resolving copyright claims;
            (2) whether adjustments to the authority of the Copyright 
        Claims Board, including eligible claims and works and 
        applicable damages limitations, are necessary or advisable;
            (3) whether greater allowance should be made to permit 
        awards of attorneys' fees and costs to prevailing parties, 
        including potential limitations on such awards;
            (4) potential mechanisms to assist copyright owners with 
        small claims in ascertaining the identity and location of 
        unknown online infringers;
            (5) whether the Copyright Claims Board should be expanded 
        to offer mediation or other nonbinding alternative dispute 
        resolution services to interested parties; and
            (6) such other matters as the Register of Copyrights 
        believes may be pertinent concerning the Copyright Claims 
        Board.
