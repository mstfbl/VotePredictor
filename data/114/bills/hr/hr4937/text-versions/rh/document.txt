improving natural gas transmission and hazardous liquid pipeline 
facility integrity risk analysis.
    (b) Membership.--The working group convened pursuant to subsection 
(a) shall include representatives from--
            (1) the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
        Administration;
            (2) industry stakeholders, including operators of pipeline 
        facilities, inspection technology vendors, and pipeline 
        inspection organizations;

Secretary on--
            (1) the need for, and the identification of, a system to 
        ensure that dig verification data are shared with in-line 
        inspection operators to the extent consistent with the need to 
        maintain proprietary and security sensitive data in a 
        confidential manner to improve pipeline safety and inspection 
        technology;
            (2) ways to encourage the exchange of pipeline inspection 
        information and the development of advanced pipeline inspection 
        technologies and enhanced risk analysis;
            (3) opportunities to share data, including dig verification 
        data between operators of pipeline facilities and in-line 
        inspector vendors to expand knowledge of the advantages and 
        disadvantages of the different types of in-line inspection 
        technology and methodologies;
            (4) options to create a secure system that protects 
        proprietary data while encouraging the exchange of pipeline 
        inspection information and the development of advanced pipeline 
        inspection technologies and enhanced risk analysis; and
            (5) regulatory, funding, and legal barriers to sharing the 
        information described in paragraphs (1) through (4).

shall consider--
            (1) any efforts underway to test a secure information-
        sharing system for the purpose described in subsection (a);
            (2) any progress in establishing common standards for 
        maintaining, collecting, and presenting pipeline safety 
        regulatory inspection data, and a methodology for the sharing 
        of the data;
            (3) any existing inadequacies or gaps in State and Federal 
        inspection, enforcement, geospatial, or other pipeline safety 
        regulatory inspection data;
            (4) the potential safety benefits of a national integrated 
        pipeline database; and
            (5) recommendations of stakeholders for how to implement a 
        secure information-sharing system that protects proprietary and 
        security sensitive information and data for the purpose 
        described in subsection (a).
