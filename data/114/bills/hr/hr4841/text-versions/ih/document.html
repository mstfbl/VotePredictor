                                 A BILL


 
  To establish programs for health care provider training in Federal 
health care and medical facilities, to establish Federal co-prescribing 
guidelines, to establish a grant program with respect to naloxone, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Co-Prescribing Saves Lives Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Together, the misuse of heroin and opioids account for 
        approximately 25,000 deaths in the United States per year.
            (2) Drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 
        the United States in 2013, and among people 25 to 64 years old, 
        drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle fatalities 
        in 2013.
            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in the United States, fatal opioid-related drug 
        overdose rates have more than quadrupled since 1990 and have 
        never been higher. Each day in the United States, 46 people die 
        from an overdose of prescription painkillers. Nearly 2,000,000 
        Americans aged 12 or older either abused or were dependent on 
        opioids in 2013.
            (4) Naloxone is a safe and effective antidote to all 
        opioid-related overdoses, including heroin and fentanyl, and is 
        a critical tool in preventing fatal opioid overdoses in both 
        health care and at-home settings.
            (5) The opioid overdose antidote naloxone has reversed more 
        than 26,000 overdose cases between 1996 and 2014, according to 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
