                                 A BILL


 
  To impose sanctions against any entity with respect to which Iran's 
Revolutionary Guard Corps owns, directly or indirectly, a 20 percent or 
        greater interest in the entity, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Quarantining the Ayatollah's State-
Sponsored Aggression and Militancy (QASSAM) Act''.

    TITLE I--IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS WATCH LIST AND REPORT

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) threatens the 
        national security of the United States and United States 
        allies.
            (2) The IRGC provides direct sponsorship and support to 
        numerous foreign terrorist organizations, including Hamas and 
        Hezbollah, and maintains support for the Bashar al-Assad regime 
        in Syria which is responsible for hundreds of thousands of 
        deaths.
            (3) The United States holds the IRGC responsible for severe 
        and continuing human rights violations against the Iranian 
        people, including unlawful arrests, torture, and harassment.
            (4) The United States currently upholds sanctions against 
        the IRGC for its support of terrorism and human rights abuses.
            (5) The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department 
        of the Treasury currently includes the IRGC on the list of 
        specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained 
        by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of 
        the Treasury (in this section referred to as the ``SDN list'').
            (6) The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department 
        of the Treasury includes on the SDN list entities in which the 
        IRGC owns a 50 percent or greater interest. The inclusion of an 
        entity on the SDN list results in the blocking of all assets 
        and property of such entity. This regulation, commonly termed 
        the ``50 percent rule'', is codified in section 561.405 of 
        title 31, Code of Federal Regulations, and is the standard used 
        by the Office of Foreign Assets Control when determining 
        ownership of entities owned or controlled by blocked or 
        sanctioned persons.
            (7) The IRGC maintains a powerful and expansive presence 
        throughout Iran's financial, commercial, and oil sectors, 
        owning, controlling, operating, and influencing Iranian 
        entities while producing revenues estimated in the billions of 
        dollars. According to the Department of the Treasury, ``The 
        IRGC has a growing presence in Iran's financial and commercial 
        sectors and extensive economic interests in the defense 
        production, construction, and oil industries, controlling 
        billions of dollars in corporate business.''.
            (8) The IRGC has continuously practiced sanctions evasion 
        and deceptive business practices to conceal its ownership over 
        Iranian entities, owning numerous Iranian entities which are 
        not on the SDN list because IRGC ownership is below 50 percent, 
        leaving such entities unsanctioned and open to business.
            (9) As sanctions are lifted and Iran becomes more open to 
        international commerce, the international community must be 
        aware of any and all entities that are IRGC-owned, -controlled, 
        -operated, or influenced, including those entities that do not 
        make the threshold to be included on the SDN list.

Department of the Treasury.

        property are in the United States, come within the United 
        States, or are or come within the possession or control of a 
        United States person.
            (2) Inapplicability of national emergency requirement.--The
