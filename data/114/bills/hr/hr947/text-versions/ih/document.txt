SEC. 3. PREMIUM RATES.

    Section 1308 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4015) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(n) Prohibition on Lowering Premium Rate for Structures Rebuilt 
Pursuant to Certain Variances.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this title, after the repair and restoration of a residential structure 
pursuant to a variance granted in accordance with section 1315(a)(3), 
the chargeable premium rate for the structure may not be lower than the 
rate that otherwise would apply to the structure if the structure had 
not been substantially damaged by a fire or other disaster, not 
including a flood, and repaired and restored pursuant to the 
variance.''.
