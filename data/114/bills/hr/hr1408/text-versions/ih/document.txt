    (b) Study of the Appropriate Capital for Mortgage Servicing

            (1) In general.--The Federal banking agencies shall, 
        jointly, conduct a study of the appropriate capital 
        requirements for mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic 
        banking institutions.
            (2) Issues to be studied.--The study required by this 
        subsection shall include, with a specific focus on nonsystemic 
        banking institutions--
                    (A) the risk to banking institutions of holding 
                mortgage servicing assets;
                    (B) the history of the market for mortgage 
                servicing assets, including particularly the market for 
                such assets in the period of the financial crisis;
                    (C) the ability of banking institutions to 
                establish a value for their mortgage servicing assets 
                through periodic sales or other means;
                    (D) regulatory approaches to mortgage servicing 
                assets in addition to capital requirements that could 
                be used to address concerns about the value of and 
                ability to sell mortgage servicing assets;
                    (E) the impact of imposing the Basel III capital 
                requirements and the NCUA capital requirements on 
                nonsystemic banking institutions on their ability to 
                compete in the mortgage servicing business, including 
                the need for economies of scale to compete in that 
                business, and on their ability to provide service to 
                consumers to whom they have made a mortgage loan;
                    (F) an analysis of what the mortgage servicing 
                marketplace would look like if the Basel III capital 
                requirements and the NCUA capital requirements on 
                mortgage servicing assets--
                            (i) were fully implemented; and
                            (ii) applied to both banking institutions 
                        and nondepository residential mortgage loan 
                        servicers;
                    (G) the significance of problems with mortgage 
                servicing assets, if any, in banking institution 
                failures and problem banking institutions, including 
                specifically identifying failed banking institutions 
                where mortgage servicing assets contributed to the 
                failure; and
                    (H) an analysis of the relevance of the Basel III 
                capital requirements and the NCUA capital requirements 
                on mortgage servicing assets to the banking systems of 
                other significant developed countries.
            (3) Report to congress.--Not later than the end of the 6-
        month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Federal banking agencies shall issue a report to the 
        Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate 
        and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
        Representatives containing--
                    (A) the results of the study required under 
                paragraph (1); and
                    (B) any analysis on the specific issue of mortgage 
                servicing assets undertaken by the Federal banking 
                agencies prior to finalizing regulations implementing 
                the Basel III capital requirements and the NCUA capital 
                requirements.
    (c) Delay of Rulemaking.--
            (1) Rules on mortgage servicing assets.--Notwithstanding 
        any other provision of law, no regulation to implement the 
        Basel III capital requirements or the NCUA capital requirements 
        with respect to mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic 
        banking institutions shall take effect before the end of the 3-
        month period beginning on the date the report is issued under 
        subsection (b)(3).
            (2) Final rule requirements.--Before any final rule is 
        issued by a Federal banking agency with respect to capital 
        requirements on mortgage servicing assets for nonsystemic 
        banking institutions, the Federal banking agency shall--
                    (A) if the related proposed rule was issued before 
                the date on which the report is issued under subsection 
                (b)(3), issue a new proposed rule for public comment; 
                and
                    (B) consider regulatory approaches to mortgage 
                servicing assets that could address concerns about the 
                value of and ability to sell mortgage servicing assets.
