        paragraph (1) shall include, with a specific focus on banking 
        institutions--
                    (A) the risk to banking institutions of holding 
                mortgage servicing assets;
                    (B) the history of the market for mortgage 
                servicing assets, including in particular the market 
                for those assets in the period of the financial crisis;
                    (C) the ability of banking institutions to 
                establish a value for mortgage servicing assets of the

                    (D) regulatory approaches to mortgage servicing 
                assets and capital requirements that may be used to 
                address concerns about the value of and ability to sell 
                mortgage servicing assets;
                    (E) the impact of imposing the Basel III capital 
                requirements and the NCUA capital requirements on 
                banking institutions on the ability of those 
                institutions--
                            (i) to compete in the mortgage servicing 
                        business, including the need for economies of 
                        scale to compete in that business; and
                            (ii) to provide service to consumers to 
                        whom the institutions have made mortgage loans;
                    (F) an analysis of what the mortgage servicing 
                marketplace would look like if the Basel III capital 
                requirements and the NCUA capital requirements on 
                mortgage servicing assets--
                            (i) were fully implemented; and
                            (ii) applied to both banking institutions 
                        and nondepository residential mortgage loan 
                        servicers;
                    (G) the significance of problems with mortgage 
                servicing assets, if any, in banking institution 
                failures and problem banking institutions, including 
                specifically identifying failed banking institutions 
                where mortgage servicing assets contributed to the 
                failure; and
                    (H) an analysis of the relevance of the Basel III 
                capital requirements and the NCUA capital requirements 
                on mortgage servicing assets to the banking systems of 
                other significantly developed countries.
            (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Federal banking agencies 
        shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
        Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services 
        of the House of Representatives a report containing--

                paragraph (1);
                    (B) any analysis on the specific issue of mortgage 
                servicing assets undertaken by the Federal banking 
                agencies before finalizing regulations implementing the 
                Basel III capital requirements and the NCUA capital 
                requirements; and
                    (C) any recommendations for legislative or 
                regulatory actions that would address concerns about 
                the value of and ability to sell and the ability of 
                banking institutions to hold mortgage servicing assets.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 14, 2015.

            Attest:
