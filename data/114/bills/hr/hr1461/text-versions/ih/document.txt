            (2) Diverting user fees, such as the fuel tax, away from 
        funding projects for the construction of roads, bridges, and 
        other critical national infrastructure has jeopardized the 
        solvency of the Highway Trust Fund.
            (3) Projects for the construction of mass transit 
        facilities, bike paths, and other non-highway infrastructure 
        should be funded from revenue sources other than the Highway 
        Trust Fund.

        ``March 31, 1983''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(6) Transfer to highway account.--On October 1, 2015, the
