    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment

appropriate, establish a policy directing all air carriers providing 
scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air transportation to 
establish policies that enable a child, who is age 13 or under on the 
date an applicable flight is scheduled to occur, to be seated in a seat 
adjacent to the seat of an accompanying family member over the age of 
13, to the maximum extent practicable and at no additional cost, except 
when assignment to an adjacent seat would require an upgrade to another 
cabin class or a seat with extra legroom or seat pitch for which 
additional payment is normally required.
    (b) Effect on Airline Boarding and Seating Policies.--When 
considering any new policy under this section, the Secretary shall 
consider the traditional seating and boarding policies of air carriers 
providing scheduled passenger interstate or intrastate air 
transportation and whether those policies generally allow families to 
sit together.
    (c) Statutory Construction.--Notwithstanding the requirement in 
subsection (a), nothing in this section may be construed to allow the 
Secretary to impose a significant change in the overall seating or 
boarding policy of an air carrier providing scheduled passenger

        (1), the Administrator shall consider--
                    (A) increased fines and advanced oversight for 
                airport operators that report missing more than five 
                percent of credentials for unescorted access to any 
                SIDA of an airport;
                    (B) best practices for Category X airport operators 
                that report missing more than three percent of

                airport;
                    (C) additional audits and status checks for airport 
                operators that report missing more than three percent 
                of credentials for unescorted access to any SIDA of an 
                airport;
                    (D) review and analysis of the prior five years of 
                audits for airport operators that report missing more 
                than three percent of credentials for unescorted access 
                to any SIDA of an airport;
                    (E) increased fines and direct enforcement 
                requirements for both airport workers and their 
                employers that fail to report within 24 hours an 
                employment termination or a missing credential for 
                unescorted access to any SIDA of an airport; and

        X airport are missing, or more than five percent of credentials 
        to access any SIDA at any other airport are missing; and
            (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees an 
        annual report on the number of violations and fines related to 
        unescorted access to the SIDA of an airport collected in the
