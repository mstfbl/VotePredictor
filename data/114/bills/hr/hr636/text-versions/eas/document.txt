                relates to assessing damage to critical infrastructure 
                such as roads, bridges, and utilities, including water 
                and power, ultimately speeding response time;
            (2) advancements in miniaturization of safety technologies, 
        including for aircraft weighing under 4.4 pounds, have 
        increased economic opportunities for using unmanned aircraft 
        systems while reducing kinetic energy and risk compared to 
        unmanned aircraft that may weigh as much as 55 pounds;
            (3) advancements in unmanned technology will have the 
        capacity to ultimately improve manned aircraft safety; and
            (4) integrating unmanned aircraft systems safely into the 
        national airspace, including beyond visual line of sight and 
        nighttime operations on a routine basis should remain a top 
        priority for the Federal Aviation Administration as it pursues

SEC. 3101. CAUSES OF AIRLINE DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS.

    (a) Review.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall 
        review the categorization of delays and cancellations with 
        respect to air carriers that are required to report such data.
            (2) Considerations.--In conducting the review under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider, at a minimum--
                    (A) whether delays and cancellations attributed by 
                an air carrier to weather were unavoidable due to an 
                operational or air traffic control issue, or due to the 
                air carrier's preference in determining which flights 
                to delay or cancel during a weather event;
                    (B) whether and to what extent delays and 
                cancellations attributed by an air carrier to weather 
                disproportionately impact service to smaller airports 
                and communities; and
                    (C) whether it is an unfair or deceptive practice 
                in violation of section 41712 of title 49, United 
                States Code, for an air carrier to inform a passenger 
                that a flight is delayed or cancelled due to weather, 
                without any other context or explanation for the delay 
                or cancellation, when the air carrier has discretion as 
                to which flights to delay or cancel.
            (3) Advisory committee for aviation consumer protection.--
        The Secretary may use the Advisory Committee for Aviation

subsection (a) is complete, the Secretary shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a report on the review under 
subsection (a), including any recommendations.

as affecting the decision of an air carrier to maximize its system 
capacity during weather-related events to accommodate the greatest 
number of passengers.

SEC. 3102. INVOLUNTARY CHANGES TO ITINERARIES.

    (a) Review.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of

        review whether it is an unfair or deceptive practice in 
        violation of section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, for 
        an air carrier to change the itinerary of a passenger, more 
        than 24 hours before departure, if the new itinerary involves 
        additional stops or departs 3 hours earlier or later and 
        compensation or other more suitable air transportation is not 
        offered.
            (2) Advisory committee for aviation consumer protection.--
        The Secretary may use the Advisory Committee for Aviation 
        Consumer Protection, established under section 411 of the FAA 
        Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 42301 prec.

        refunds or other consideration to a consumer who is impacted by

        which flights to cancel or delay during a weather-related 
        event.
            (2) Requiring an air carrier to provide notification and

SEC. 4104. FACILITY OUTAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On September 26, 2014, an Administration contract 
        employee deliberately started a fire that destroyed critical 
        equipment at the Administration's Chicago Air Route Traffic 
        Control Center (referred to in this section as the ``Chicago 
        Center'') in Aurora, Illinois.
            (2) As a result of the damage, Chicago Center was unable to 
        control air traffic for more than 2 weeks, thousands of flights 
        were delayed or cancelled into and out of O'Hare International 
        Airport and Midway Airport in Chicago, and aviation 
        stakeholders and airlines reportedly lost over $350,000,000.
            (3) According to the Office of the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Transportation, the fire at Chicago Center 
        demonstrated that the Administration's contingency plans for 
        the Chicago Center and the airspace it controls do not ensure 
        redundancy and resiliency for sustained operations.
            (4) Further, the Inspector General found that Chicago 
        Center incident highlighted the limited flexibility and lack of 
        resiliency in critical elements of the Administration's current 
        air traffic control infrastructure, including limited 
        communication capacity and the inability to easily transfer 
        control of airspace and flight plans.
    (b) Comprehensive Contingency Plan.--Not later than 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall update the 
Administration's comprehensive contingency plan to address potential 
air traffic facility outages that could have a major impact on 
operation of the national airspace system.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the plan is 
updated under subsection (b), the Administrator shall submit to the 
appropriate committees of Congress a report on the update, including 
any recommendations for ensuring air traffic facility outages do not 
have a major impact on operation of the national airspace system.

SEC. 4105. ADS-B MANDATE ASSESSMENT.

    (a) Assessment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation 
shall assess--
            (1) Administration and industry readiness to meet the ADS-B 
        mandate by 2020;
            (2) changes to ADS-B program since May 2010; and
            (3) additional options to comply with the mandate and 
        consequences, both for individual system users and for the 
        overall safety and efficiency of the national airspace system, 
        for noncompliance.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the assessment 
under subsection (a) is complete, the Inspector General of the 
Department of Transportation shall submit to the appropriate committees 
of Congress a report on the progress made toward meeting the ADS-B 
mandate by 2020, including any recommendations of the Inspector General 
to carry out such mandate.

SEC. 4106. NEXTGEN INTEROPERABILITY.

    (a) In General.--To implement a more effective international

       TITLE VI--TRANSPORTATION SECURITY AND TERRORISM PREVENTION

       Subtitle A--Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act

SEC. 6101. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security Enhancement 
and Oversight Act''.

SEC. 6102. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the 
        United States have involved the use of Secure Identification 
        Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') badges, 
        the credentials used by airport and airline workers to access 
        the secure areas of an airport.
            (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield-
        Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using 
        his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and 
        facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a number 
        of months via commercial aircraft.
            (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety 
        Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his SIDA 
        badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and transport a 
        firearm in his carry-on luggage.
            (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that 
        over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta 
        International Airport were lost or missing.
            (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation 
        Security Administration contractors were indicted for 
        participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed 
        through the secure area of the San Francisco International 
        Airport.
            (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not 
        maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead 
        relies on airport operators to track airport worker 
        credentials.
            (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement 
        authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain 
        threshold of missing SIDA badges.
            (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee 
        issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access 
        control.
            (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department 
        of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not 
        have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers who 
        had records in United States intelligence-related databases 
        because the Administration was not authorized to receive all 
        terrorism-related information under current interagency 
        watchlisting policy.
            (10) The Inspector General also found that the 
        Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to 
        reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment 
        investigations, including criminal history record checks and 
        work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight 
        over the airport operators that the Administration relies on to 
        perform criminal history and work authorization checks for 
        airport workers.
            (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider 
        threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities.

                employers that fail to report within 24 hours an 
                employment termination or a missing credential for 
                unescorted access to any SIDA of an airport; and

        security commensurate with the level of security required by 
        United States air cargo security programs, the Administrator 
        may revoke or temporarily suspend such approval and official 
        recognition until such time as the Administrator determines

        required by such United States air cargo security programs.
            (2) Notification.--If the Administrator of the

        on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the
