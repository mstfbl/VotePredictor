            (1) In general.--The 2015 ozone standards shall not apply 
        to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit 
        application if--
                    (A) the Administrator or the State, local, or 
                tribal permitting authority, as applicable, determines 
                the application to be complete on or before the date of 
                promulgation of the final designation of the area

                public notice of a preliminary determination or draft 
                permit for the application before the date that is 60 
                days after the date of promulgation of the final

                of the criteria for ozone published under section 108 
                of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7408) or the national ambient 
                air quality standard for ozone promulgated under

consultation with the independent scientific review committee appointed 
under subsection (d), finds that a range of levels of air quality for 
an air pollutant are requisite to protect public health with an 
adequate margin of safety, as described in the preceding sentence, the 
Administrator may consider, as a secondary consideration, likely 
technological feasibility in establishing and revising the national 
primary ambient air quality standard for such pollutant.''.
    (c) Consideration of Adverse Public Health, Welfare, Social, 
Economic, or Energy Effects.--Section 109(d)(2) of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7409(d)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(D) Prior to establishing or revising a national ambient air 
quality standard, the Administrator shall request, and such committee 
shall provide, advice under subparagraph (C)(iv) regarding any adverse 
public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may 
result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of such 
national ambient air quality standard.''.
    (d) Timely Issuance of Implementing Regulations and Guidance.--
Section 109 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409) is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(e) Timely Issuance of Implementing Regulations and Guidance.--
            ``(1) In general.--In publishing any final rule 
        establishing or revising a national ambient air quality 
        standard, the Administrator shall, as the Administrator 
        determines necessary to assist States, permitting authorities, 
        and permit applicants, concurrently publish regulations and 
        guidance for implementing the standard, including information 
        relating to submission and consideration of a preconstruction 
        permit application under the new or revised standard.
            ``(2) Applicability of standard to preconstruction 
        permitting.--If the Administrator fails to publish final 
        regulations and guidance that include information relating to 
        submission and consideration of a preconstruction permit 
        application under a new or revised national ambient air quality 
        standard concurrently with such standard, then such standard 
        shall not apply to the review and disposition of a 
        preconstruction permit application until the Administrator has 
        published such final regulations and guidance.
            ``(3) Rules of construction.--
                    ``(A) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed 
                to preclude the Administrator from issuing regulations 
                and guidance to assist States, permitting authorities, 
                and permit applicants in implementing a national 
                ambient air quality standard subsequent to publishing 
                regulations and guidance for such standard under 
                paragraph (1).
                    ``(B) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed 
                to eliminate the obligation of a preconstruction permit 
                applicant to install best available control technology 
                and lowest achievable emission rate technology, as 
                applicable.
                    ``(C) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed 
                to limit the authority of a State, local, or tribal 
                permitting authority to impose more stringent emissions 
                requirements pursuant to State, local, or tribal law 
                than national ambient air quality standards.
