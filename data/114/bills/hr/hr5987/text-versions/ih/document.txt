        of recreational vessels on such waters.
    (b) Fees.--The Board of Directors may levy fees on the owner of a

Directors--
            (1) may not require the removal of such floating cabin--
                    (A) in the case of a floating cabin that was 
                granted a permit by the Tennessee Valley Authority 
                before the date of enactment of this section, for a 
                period of 15 years beginning on such date; and
                    (B) in the case of a floating cabin not granted a 
                permit by the Tennessee Valley Authority before the 
                date of enactment of this section, for a period of 5 
                years beginning on such date; and
            (2) shall approve and allow the use of the floating cabin 
        on waters under the jurisdiction of the Tennessee Valley 
        Authority at such time, and for such duration, as the floating 
        cabin meets the requirements of subsection (a) and the owner of 
        such cabin has paid any fee levied pursuant to subsection (b).
    (d) Definition of Floating Cabin.--In this section, the term
