SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Border Security Review 
Act''.

SEC. 2. NORTHERN BORDER THREAT ANALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit 
to the appropriate congressional committees a Northern Border threat 
analysis that includes--
            (1) current and potential terrorism and criminal threats 
        posed by individuals and organized groups seeking to--
                    (A) enter the United States through the Northern 
                Border; or
                    (B) exploit border vulnerabilities along the 
                Northern Border;
            (2) improvements needed at and between ports of entry along 
        the Northern Border to--
                    (A) prevent terrorists and instruments of terror 
                from entering the United States; and
                    (B) reduce criminal activity, as measured by the 
                total flow of illegal goods, illicit drugs, and 
                smuggled and trafficked persons moved in either 
                direction across the Northern Border;
            (3) gaps in law, policy, cooperation between State, local, 
        and tribal law enforcement, international agreements, or tribal 
        agreements that hinder effective and efficient border security, 
        counter-terrorism, anti-human smuggling and trafficking 
        efforts, and the flow of legitimate trade along the Northern 
        Border; and
            (4) an analysis of whether additional U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection preclearance and pre-inspection operations at 
        ports of entry along the Northern Border could help prevent 
        terrorists and instruments of terror from entering the United 
        States.
    (b) Analysis Requirements.--For the threat analysis required under 
subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consider and 
examine--
            (1) technology needs and challenges;
            (2) personnel needs and challenges;
            (3) the role of State, local, and tribal law enforcement in 
        general border security activities;
            (4) the need for cooperation among Federal, State, local, 
        tribal, and Canadian law enforcement entities relating to 
        border security; and
            (5) the terrain, population density, and climate along the 
        Northern Border.
    (c) Classified Threat Analysis.--To the extent possible, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit the threat analysis 
required under subsection (a) in unclassified form. The Secretary may 
submit a portion of the threat analysis in classified form if the 
Secretary determines such is appropriate.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Homeland Security and 
                Governmental Affairs of the Senate;
                    (B) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;
                    (C) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House 
                of Representatives; and
                    (D) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
                Representatives.
