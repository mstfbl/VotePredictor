  To require the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a northern 
            border threat analysis, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Border Security Review 
Act''.

SEC. 2. NORTHERN BORDER THREAT ANALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit 
to the appropriate congressional committees a northern border threat 
analysis. Such analysis, at a minimum, shall include the following:
            (1) An analysis of current and potential terrorism threats 
        posed by individuals seeking to enter the United States through 
        the northern border.
            (2) An analysis of improvements needed at ports of entry 
        along the northern border to prevent terrorists and instruments 
        of terror from entering the United States.
            (3) An analysis of the number of additional U.S. Customs 
        and Border Protection agents and officers needed at and between 
        ports of entry along the northern border.
            (4) An analysis of gaps in law, policy, international 
        agreements, or tribal agreements that hinder the border 
        security and counterterrorism efforts along the northern 
        border.
            (5) An analysis of illegal cross border activity between 
        ports of entry, including the maritime borders of the Great 
        Lakes.
            (6) An analysis of the scope of border security challenges 
        that shall include the terrain, population density, and climate 
        along the northern border.
            (7) An analysis of whether additional preclearance and pre-
        inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of 
        entry along the northern border could help prevent terrorists 
        and their instruments from entering the United States.
    (b) Classified Threat Analysis.--The threat analysis required under 
subsection (a) may be submitted in classified form, if the Secretary of 
Homeland Security determines that such is appropriate.
