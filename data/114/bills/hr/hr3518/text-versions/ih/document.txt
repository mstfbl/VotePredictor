                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 28, United States Code, to prohibit the use of amounts 
 from the Asset Forfeiture Fund for the Domestic Cannabis Suppression/
  Eradication Program of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Civil Asset Forfeiture Funding 
for Marijuana Suppression Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. RESTRICTION ON USE OF THE ASSET FORFEITURE FUND FOR THE 
              DOMESTIC CANNABIS SUPPRESSION/ERADICATION PROGRAM.

    Section 524 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(e) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, beginning in 
fiscal year 2015, and for each fiscal year thereafter, no amounts in 
the Fund may be used for the Domestic Cannabis Suppression/Eradication 
Program of the Drug Enforcement Administration, or any substantially 
similar program.''.

SEC. 3. NO AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF THE DOMESTIC 
              CANNABIS SUPPRESSION/ERADICATION PROGRAM.

    Notwithstanding section 981(e) of title 18, United States Code, no 
property may be transferred to a Federal agency or a State and local 
agency, if that property is used for any purpose pertaining to the 
Domestic Cannabis Suppression/Eradication Program of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, or any substantially similar program.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) expends a large amount of resources on enforcing 
prohibitions on marijuana. The DEA administrator's comments about the 
relative harm of marijuana support Congress's belief that the DEA's 
marijuana prohibition policy is an inappropriate use of resources.
