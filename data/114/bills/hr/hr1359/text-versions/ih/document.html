_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
       To authorize the establishment of American Dream Accounts.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Dream Accounts Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Only 9.8 out of every 100 individuals from low-income 
        families will graduate from an institution of higher education 
        before reaching the age of 24.
            (2) Lack of knowledge about how to apply to, and pay for, 
        an institution of higher education is a barrier for many low-
        income students and students who would be in the first 
        generation in their families to attend an institution of higher 
        education.
            (3) According to Public Agenda, most young adults give 
        secondary school counselors fair or poor ratings for advice 
        about attending an institution of higher education, including 
        advice about how to decide what institution of higher education 
        to attend, how to pay for higher education, what careers to 
        pursue, and how to apply to an institution of higher education.
            (4) More than 1,700,000 students fail to file the Free 
        Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and about one-
        third of such students would qualify for a Federal Pell Grant.
            (5) During the last 2 decades, costs of attending 
        institutions of higher education have increased dramatically, 
        but need-based financial aid has not kept pace with such 
        increasing costs.
            (6) In the 1990-1991 school year, the maximum Federal Pell 
        Grant covered 45 percent of the average cost of attendance at a 
        public 4-year institution of higher education (including 
        tuition, fees, room, and board), but in the 2010-2011 school 
        year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered only 34 percent of 
        such cost.
            (7) Parental and youth college savings are strong 
        predictors of a youth's expectations about attendance at an 
        institution of higher education.
            (8) Only 32 percent of parents who earn less than $35,000 a 
        year are saving for their child's education at an institution 
        of higher education.
            (9) According to the Center for Social Development, 
        ``wilt'' occurs when a young person who expects to graduate 
        from a 4-year institution of higher education has not yet 
        attended such institution by the ages of 19 to 22.
            (10) Children who have savings dedicated for attendance at 
        an institution of higher education are 4 times more likely to 
        attend a 4-year institution of higher education and avoid 
        ``wilt''.
