        amount required to be apportioned to any State under each of 
        paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section 104(b) for the fiscal 
        year if the Secretary determines that the State does not 
        satisfy the requirement under paragraph (2) of this subsection 
        as of that date.
            ``(2) Requirement.--A State satisfies the requirement under 
        this paragraph if the State has enacted and is enforcing a law 
        that--

                        device if such operator is 21 years of age or 
                        older; and
                    ``(B) requires, upon conviction of a violation of a
