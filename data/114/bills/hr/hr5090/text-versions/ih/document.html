  To ensure that air transportation between the United States and the 
European Union complies with the intent of article 17 bis of the United 
 States-European Union-Norway-Iceland Air Transport Agreement of June 
                               21, 2011.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. TRANSATLANTIC OPEN SKIES.

    The Secretary of Transportation shall not issue a foreign air 
carrier permit under section 41302 of title 49, United States Code, or 
an exemption under section 40109 of such title, to provide foreign air 
transportation under the United States-European Union-Norway-Iceland 
Air Transport Agreement of June 21, 2011 (as amended), unless the 
Secretary--
            (1) finds that issuing the permit or exemption would be 
        consistent with the intent of the parties, set forth in article 
        17 bis of such agreement, that opportunities created by the 
        agreement do not undermine labor standards or the labor-related 
        rights and principles contained in the parties' respective 
        laws; and
            (2) imposes such conditions on the permit or exemption as 
        may be necessary to ensure that the carrier's provision of 
        foreign air transportation complies with the intent of article 
        17 bis.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
