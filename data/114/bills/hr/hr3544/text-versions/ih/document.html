                                 A BILL


 
 To help keep law enforcement officers and communities safer by making 
   grants to purchase body worn cameras for use by State, local, and 
                    tribal law enforcement officers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safer Officers and Safer Citizens 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While police body worn cameras are not a panacea, they 
        do contribute to keeping both law enforcement officers and 
        citizens safer.
            (2) Increasing the use of body worn cameras by law 
        enforcement officers has been shown by multiple studies to 
        significantly reduce the number of use of force incidents and 
        the number of citizen complaints.
            (3) Increased accountability and transparency in policing 
        activities will benefit all our citizens, including our law 
        enforcement officers.

SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.

    Title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 
(42 U.S.C. 3711 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

  ``PART LL--GRANT PROGRAM FOR BODY WORN CAMERAS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
                                OFFICERS

``SEC. 3021. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.

    ``(b) Uses of Funds.--Grants awarded under this section shall be--
            ``(1) distributed directly to the State, unit of local 
        government, or Indian tribe; and

    ``(c) Preferential Consideration.--In awarding grants under this 
part, the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance shall give 
preferential consideration, if feasible, to an application from a 
jurisdiction that--
            ``(1) has in place a comprehensive policy that is--
                    ``(A) developed in consultation with a broad group 
                of criminal justice experts and community members, and 
                that contains policies and procedures addressing 
                deployment, video capture, privacy protections, 
                viewing, use, release, storage, retention, the effect 
                on community-police interactions, and audits and 
                controls;
                    ``(B) supported by a comprehensive communication

                bar, civic leadership, labor organizations, victim and 
                juvenile advocacy, the media, and the public; and
                    ``(C) informed by the best practices on body worn 
                cameras developed by the Department of Justice;
            ``(2) has the greatest need for body worn cameras based on 
        the percentage of law enforcement officers in the department 
        who do not have access to a body worn camera;
            ``(3) has a violent crime rate at or above the national 
        average as determined by the Bureau of Justice Statistics; and
            ``(4) commits to submitting such metrics on the usage of 
        body worn cameras, in such a format and at such a time as the 
        Department of Justice shall reasonably specify, for the 
        purposes of collecting and studying data on the effectiveness 
        of body worn cameras to increase safety for both law 
        enforcement officers and citizens.
    ``(d) Matching Funds.--The portion of the costs of a program 
provided by a grant under subsection (a) may not exceed 75 percent. Any 
funds appropriated by Congress for the activities of any agency of an 
Indian tribal government or the Bureau of Indian Affairs performing law

non-Federal share of a matching requirement funded under this 
subsection.

``SEC. 3022. APPLICATIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--To request a grant under this part, the chief 
executive of a State, unit of local government, or Indian tribe shall 
submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance in such form and containing such information as the Director 
may reasonably require.
    ``(b) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the

Assistance shall promulgate regulations to implement this section, 
including the information that must be included and the requirements 
that the States, units of local government, and Indian tribes must meet 
in submitting the applications required under this section.

``SEC. 3023. DEFINITIONS.

    ``For purposes of this part--
            ``(1) the term `Indian tribe' has the same meaning as in 
        section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
        Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e));
            ``(2) the term `law enforcement officer' means any officer, 
        agent, or employee of a State, unit of local government, or 
        Indian tribe authorized by law or by a government agency to 
        engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, or 
        investigation of any violation of criminal law, or authorized 
        by law to supervise sentenced criminal offenders;
            ``(3) the term `State' means each of the 50 States, the 
        District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
        United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the 
        Northern Mariana Islands; and
            ``(4) the term `unit of local government' means a county, 
        municipality, town, township, village, parish, borough, or

``SEC. 3024. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to carry

    ``(b) Remaining Funds.--Any amounts made available to carry out 
this part that are unobligated at the end of each fiscal year, shall be 
returned to the general fund of the Treasury for debt reduction.''.

SEC. 4. OFFSET.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Office of Personnel Management allows for 
        administrative leave as an administratively authorized absence 
        from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave, but 
        recognizes that administrative leave is not an entitlement, and 
        agencies are not required to grant it.
            (2) Administrative leave does not include annual leave, 
        maternity leave, sick leave, leave taken in accordance with the 
        Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2611 et seq.), 
        or military leave.
            (3) A Government Accountability Office report on Federal 
        paid administrative leave detailed data from the Office of 
        Personnel Management that showed that from fiscal year 2011 
        through fiscal year 2013, about 97 percent of Federal employees 
        charged 20 days or less of paid administrative leave, although 
        some Federal employees charged between 1 and 3 years of paid 
        administrative leave. Further, Agency officials stated that the 
        most common reason for which selected employees charged amounts 
        relatively higher than the agency average was for personnel 
        matters, such as investigations into alleged misconduct.
    (b) Requirement.--
            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection--
                    (A) the term ``administrative leave'' means leave 
                without loss of or reduction in--
                            (i) pay;
                            (ii) leave to which an employee is 
                        otherwise entitled; or
                            (iii) credit for time or service; and
                    (B) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given the 
                term ``executive agency'' under section 105 of title 5, 
                United States Code.
            (2) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act--
                    (A) the Office of Personnel Management shall issue 
                regulations limiting administrative leave for an 
                employee of any agency to not more than 20 days per 
                year, unless approved individually by the head of the 
                agency; and
                    (B) the Office of Management and Budget shall 
                ensure each agency adjusts the number of employees 
                (determined on a full-time equivalent basis) authorized 
                to be employed by the agency, and each component of the 
                agency, to reflect lower personnel requirements due to 
                increased available work hours per employee.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
