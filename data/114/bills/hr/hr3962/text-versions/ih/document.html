    This Act shall not prohibit any of the following:
            (1) Patrol of borders and national waters.--The use of a 
        MAVD by a Federal entity to surveil national borders or

                action is necessary--
                            (i) to prevent imminent danger of death or 
                        serious bodily harm to a specific individual;
                            (ii) to counter an imminent risk of a

                        organization;
                            (iii) to prevent imminent destruction of 
                        evidence; or
                            (iv) to counter an imminent or actual 
                        escape of a criminal or terrorist suspect.
                    (B) Records.--A Federal entity using a MAVD 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i) shall maintain a 
                retrievable record of the facts giving rise to the 
                reasonable suspicion that an exigent circumstance 
                existed.
            (3) Public safety and research.--The use of a MAVD by a 
        Federal entity--

                in connection to, or prevent forest fires;
                    (B) to monitor environmental, geologic, or weather-
                related catastrophe or damage from such an event;
                    (C) to research or survey for wildlife management, 
                habitat preservation, or geologic, atmospheric, or 
                environmental damage or conditions;
                    (D) to survey for the assessment and evaluation of 
                environmental, geologic or weather-related damage, 
                erosion, flood, or contamination; and
                    (E) to survey public lands for illegal vegetation.
            (4) Consent.--The use of a MAVD by a Federal entity for the 
        purpose of acquiring information about an individual, or about 
        an individual's property or effects, if such individual has 
        given written consent to the use of a MAVD for such purposes.
            (5) Warrant.--Law enforcement using a MAVD, pursuant to, 
        and in accordance with, a Rule 41 warrant, to surveil specific 
        property, persons, or their effects.

SEC. 5. BAN ON IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Confidential Information.--No Federal entity actor may make any 
intentional effort to identify an individual from, or associate an 
individual with, the information collected by operations authorized by 
paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 4, nor shall the collected 
information be disclosed to any entity except another Federal entity or 
State, tribal, or local government agency or department, or political 
subdivision thereof, that agrees to be bound by the restrictions in 
this Act.
    (b) Probable Cause.--The restrictions described in subsection (a) 
shall not apply if there is probable cause that the information 
collected is evidence of specific criminal activity and a warrant is 
obtained.

SEC. 6. PROHIBITION ON USE OF EVIDENCE.

    No evidence obtained or collected in violation of this Act may be 
admissible as evidence against an individual in any trial, hearing, or

authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision 
thereof.

SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON SOLICITATION AND PURCHASE.

    (a) Existing Authority.--A Federal entity shall not solicit to or 
award contracts to any entity for such entity to surveil by MAVD for 
the Federal entity, unless the Federal entity has existing authority to 
surveil the particular property, persons or their effects, or interest.
    (b) Permission Granted.--A Federal entity shall not purchase any 
information obtained from MAVD surveillance by a non-Federal entity if 
such information contains personal information, except pursuant to the 
express consent of all persons whose personal information is to be 
sold.

SEC. 8. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt any State law 
regarding the use of MAVDs exclusively within the borders of that 
State.
