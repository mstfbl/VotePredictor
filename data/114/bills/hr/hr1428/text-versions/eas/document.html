    (d) Designation of Covered Country.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General may, with the 
        concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, designate a 
        foreign country or regional economic integration organization, 
        or member country of such organization, as a ``covered 
        country'' for purposes of this section if--
                    (A)(i) the country or regional economic integration 
                organization, or member country of such organization, 
                has entered into an agreement with the United States 
                that provides for appropriate privacy protections for 
                information shared for the purpose of preventing, 
                investigating, detecting, or prosecuting criminal 
                offenses; or
                    (ii) the Attorney General has determined that the 
                country or regional economic integration organization, 
                or member country of such organization, has effectively 
                shared information with the United States for the 
                purpose of preventing, investigating, detecting, or 
                prosecuting criminal offenses and has appropriate 
                privacy protections for such shared information;
                    (B) the country or regional economic integration 
                organization, or member country of such organization, 
                permits the transfer of personal data for commercial 
                purposes between the territory of that country or 
                regional economic organization and the territory of the 
                United States, through an agreement with the United 
                States or otherwise; and
                    (C) the Attorney General has certified that the 
                policies regarding the transfer of personal data for 
                commercial purposes and related actions of the country 
                or regional economic integration organization, or 
                member country of such organization, do not materially 
                impede the national security interests of the United 
                States.
            (2) Removal of designation.--The Attorney General may, with 
        the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, revoke the 
        designation of a foreign country or regional economic 
        integration organization, or member country of such 
        organization, as a ``covered country'' if the Attorney General 
        determines that such designated ``covered country''--
                    (A) is not complying with the agreement described 
                under paragraph (1)(A)(i);
                    (B) no longer meets the requirements for 
                designation under paragraph (1)(A)(ii);
                    (C) fails to meet the requirements under paragraph 
                (1)(B);
                    (D) no longer meets the requirements for 
                certification under paragraph (1)(C); or
                    (E) impedes the transfer of information (for 
                purposes of reporting or preventing unlawful activity) 
                to the United States by a private entity or person.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
