at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) Agency Discretion.--The head of each agency has the sole and 
exclusive authority, with respect to any information technology or 
information system under the control of such agency--
            ``(1) to take any action the agency determines to be 
        necessary to reduce or eliminate security weakness and risk, 
        including to protect the information contained in the 
        information technology or information system; and
            ``(2) to take any action the agency determines to be 
        necessary to reduce or eliminate future security weakness and 
        risk, including to protect the information contained in the 
        information technology or information system.''.

Cybersecurity Act of 2015, Public Law 114-113.
