                        a delegated State agency, and such a 
                        determination has been made using acceptable 
                        data sources to include U.S. Census Bureau data

                        Statistics (including data from the Local Area

            (3) Permanent authorization of regional center program.--By 
        adding after subparagraph (D) the following:
                    ``(E) Employment creation regional centers.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Visas under this 
                        paragraph shall be made available to qualified 
                        immigrants who participate in a program 
                        involving a regional center in the United 
                        States, which has been designated by the 
                        Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation

                        a general proposal, for the promotion of 
                        economic growth, including increased exports, 
                        improved regional productivity, job creation, 
                        and increased domestic capital investment. A 
                        regional center shall have jurisdiction over a 
                        specific geographic area, which shall be 
                        described in the proposal and consistent with 
                        the purpose of concentrating pooled investment

                        a regional center under this subparagraph may 
                        be based on general predictions, contained in 
                        the proposal, concerning--
                                    ``(I) the kinds of new commercial 
                                enterprises that will receive capital

                        investors not involving regional centers, the 
                        Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation 
                        with the Secretary of Commerce, shall recognize 
                        reasonable methodologies for determining the 
                        number of jobs created by a designated regional 
                        center, including such jobs that are estimated 
                        to have been created indirectly through 
                        revenues generated from increased exports,
