SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Taxpayer-supported research investments administered by 
        the Foundation should serve the national interest.
            (2) The Foundation has made major contributions for more 
        than 60 years to strengthen and sustain the Nation's academic 
        research enterprise.
            (3) The economic strength and national security of the 
        United States, and the quality of life of all Americans, are 
        grounded in the Nation's scientific and technological 
        capabilities.
            (4) Providing support for basic research is an investment 
        in our Nation's future security and economic prosperity.
            (5) Congress applauds the Foundation's recognition that 
        wise stewardship of taxpayer dollars is necessary to maintain 
        and ensure the public's trust for funding of fundamental 
        scientific and engineering research.
            (6) Other nations are increasing their public investments 
        in basic research in the physical sciences in order to boost 
        long-term economic growth.
            (7) Longstanding United States leadership in 
        supercomputing, genomics, nanoscience, photonics, quantum 
        physics, and other key technological areas is jeopardized if 
        United States investments in basic research in the natural 
        sciences do not keep pace.
            (8) Redundant regulations and reporting requirements 
        imposed by Federal agencies on research institutions and 
        researchers increase costs by tens of millions of dollars 
        annually.
            (9) The Foundation carries out important functions by 
        supporting basic research in all science and engineering 
        disciplines and in supporting STEM education at all levels.
            (10) The research and education activities of the 
        Foundation promote the discovery, integration, dissemination, 
        and application of new knowledge in service to society and 
        prepare future generations of scientists, mathematicians, and 
        engineers who will be necessary to ensure America's leadership 
        in the global marketplace.
            (11) Many of the complex problems and challenges facing the 
        Nation increasingly require the collaboration of multiple 
        scientific disciplines. The Foundation should continue to 
        emphasize cross-directorate research collaboration and 
        activities to address these issues and encourage 
        interdisciplinary research.
            (12) The Foundation should meet the highest standards of 
        efficiency, transparency, and accountability in its stewardship 
        of public funds.
            (13) The Foundation is charged with the responsibilities--
                    (A) to develop and encourage the pursuit of a 
                national policy for the promotion of basic research and 
                education in the sciences;
                    (B) to initiate, support, and conduct basic 
                scientific research and to appraise the impact of 
                research on industrial development and the general 
                welfare;
                    (C) to initiate, support, and conduct scientific 
                research activities in connection with matters relating 
                to the national defense, at the request of the 
                Secretary of Defense;
                    (D) to award scholarships and graduate fellowships 
                in the sciences;
                    (E) to foster the interchange of scientific 
                information among scientists and across scientific 
                disciplines;
                    (F) to evaluate scientific research programs 
                undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, and 
                to correlate the Foundation's scientific research with 
                that undertaken by individuals and by public and 
                private research groups;
                    (G) to communicate effectively to American citizens 
                the relevance of public investments in scientific 
                discovery and technological innovation to the Nation's 
                security, prosperity, and welfare; and
                    (H) to establish such special commissions as the 
                Board considers necessary.
            (14) The emerging global economic, scientific, and 
        technical environment challenges long standing assumptions 
        about domestic and international policy, requiring the 
        Foundation to play a more proactive role in sustaining the 
        competitive advantage of the United States through superior 
        research capabilities.

SEC. 114. RECOMPETITION OF AWARDS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the merit-reviewed competition of grant and award 
        proposals is a hallmark of the Foundation grant and award 
        making process;
            (2) the majority of Foundation-funded multi-user research 
        facilities have transitioned to five-year cooperative 
        agreements, and every five years the program officer 
        responsible for the facility makes a recommendation to the 
        National Science Board as to the renewal, recompetition, or 
        termination of support for the facility; and
            (3) requiring the recompetition of expiring awards is based 
        on the conviction that competition is most likely to ensure the 
        effective stewardship of Foundation funds for supporting 
        research and education.
    (b) Recompetition.--The Director shall ensure that the system for 
recompetition of Maintenance and Operations of facilities, equipment 
and instrumentation is fair, consistent, and transparent and is applied 
in a manner that renews grants and awards in a timely manner. The 
Director shall periodically evaluate whether the criteria of the system 
are being applied in a manner that is transparent, reliable, and valid.

SEC. 115. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING INDUSTRY INVESTMENT IN STEM 
              EDUCATION.

            (1) in order to bolster the STEM workforce pipeline, many 
        industry sectors are becoming involved in K-12 initiatives and 
        supporting undergraduate and graduate work in STEM subject 
        areas and fields;
            (2) partnerships with education providers, STEM focused 
        competitions, and other opportunities have become important 
        aspects of private sector efforts to strengthen the STEM 
        workforce;
            (3) understanding the work that private sector 
        organizations are undertaking in STEM fields should inform the 
        Federal Government's role in STEM education; and
            (4) successful private sector STEM initiatives, as 
        reflected by measurements of relevant outcomes, should be 
        encouraged and supported by the Foundation.

SEC. 117. RESEARCH REPRODUCIBILITY AND REPLICATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the gold standard of good science is the ability of a 
        researcher or research lab to reproduce a published method and 
        finding;
            (2) there is growing concern that a significant amount of 
        published research findings cannot be reproduced or replicated, 
        which can negatively affect the public's trust in science;
            (3) there are a complex set of factors affecting 
        reproducibility and replication; and
            (4) the increasing interdisciplinary nature and complexity 
        of scientific research may be a contributing factor to issues 
        with research reproducibility and replication.
    (b) Report.--The Director shall--
            (1) not later than 45 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, enter into an agreement with the National Research 
        Council to provide, within 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, a report to assess research and data 
        reproducibility and replicability issues in interdisciplinary 
        research and to make recommendations on how to improve rigor 
        and transparency in scientific research; and

        Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
        Transportation of the Senate on the findings of the assessment, 
        together with the agreement or disagreement of the Director and 
        Board with each of its findings and recommendations.

SEC. 118. RESEARCH GRANT CONDITIONS.

    The Foundation shall establish procedures to ensure that--
            (1) a research grant awarded by the Foundation to a 
        principal investigator supports a scope of work not otherwise 
        being directly funded by grants provided by other Federal 
        agencies;
            (2) a principal investigator includes in any application 
        for a research grant awarded by the Foundation a list of all 
        Federal research funding received by the principal 
        investigator, as well as any funding that is being requested as 
        of that time;
            (3) unpublished research results used to support a grant 
        proposal made to the Foundation do not include any knowing

      TITLE II--SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS

SEC. 201. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the National Science Board's Science and 
        Engineering Indicators, the science and engineering workforce 
        has shown sustained growth for more than half a century, and 
        workers with science and engineering degrees tend to earn more 
        than comparable workers in other fields.
            (2) According to the Program for International Student 
        Assessment 2012 results, America lags behind many other nations 
        in STEM education. American students rank 21st in science and 
        26th in mathematics.
            (3) Junior Achievement USA and ING found a decrease of 25 
        percent in the percentage of teenage students interested in 
        STEM careers.
            (4) According to a 2007 report from the Department of 
        Labor, industries and firms dependent on a strong science and 
        mathematics workforce have launched a variety of programs that 
        target K-12 students and undergraduate and graduate students in 
        STEM fields.
            (5) The Federal Government spends nearly $3 billion 
        annually on STEM education related program and activities, but 
        encouraging STEM education activities beyond the scope of the 
        Federal Government, including privately sponsored competitions 
        and programs in our schools, is crucial to the future technical 
        and economic competitiveness of the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) more effective coordination and adoption of performance 
        measurement based on objective outcomes for federally supported 
        STEM programs is needed;
            (2) leveraging private and nonprofit investments in STEM 
        education will be essential to strengthening the Federal STEM 
        portfolio;
            (3) strengthening the Federal STEM portfolio may require 
        program consolidations and terminations, but such changes 
        should be based on evidence with stakeholder input;
            (4) coordinating STEM programs and activities across the 
        Federal Government in order to limit duplication and engage 
        stakeholders in STEM programs and related activities for which 
        objective outcomes can be measured will bolster results of 
        Federal STEM education programs, improve the return on 
        taxpayers' investments in STEM education programs, and in turn 
        strengthen the United States economy; and
            (5) as the Committee on STEM Education implements the 5-
        year Strategic Plan for Federal STEM education required under 
        section 101(b)(5) of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act 
        of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 6621(b)(5)), STEM education stakeholders 
        must be engaged and outcome-based evaluation metrics should be 
        considered in the coordination and consolidation efforts for 
        the Federal STEM portfolio.

SEC. 302. REGULATORY EFFICIENCY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) high and increasing administrative burdens and costs in 
        Federal research administration, particularly in the higher 
        education sector where most federally sponsored research is 
        performed, are eroding funds available to carry out basic 
        scientific research;
            (2) progress has been made over the last decade in 
        streamlining the pre-award grant application process through 
        Grants.gov, the Federal Government's website portal;
            (3) post-award administrative costs have grown as Federal 
        research agencies have continued to impose agency-unique 
        compliance and reporting requirements on researchers and 
        research institutions;
            (4) facilities and administration costs at research 
        universities can exceed 50 percent of the total value of 
        Federal research grants, and it is estimated that nearly 30 
        percent of the funds invested annually in federally funded 
        research is consumed by paperwork and other administrative 
        processes required by Federal agencies; and
            (5) it is a matter of critical importance to American 
        competitiveness that administrative costs of federally funded 
        research be streamlined so that a higher proportion of taxpayer 
        dollars flow into direct research activities.
    (b) In General.--The Director of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy shall establish a working group under the authority 
of the National Science and Technology Council, to include the Office

reviewing Federal regulations affecting research and research 
universities and making recommendations on how to--
            (1) harmonize, streamline, and eliminate duplicative 
        Federal regulations and reporting requirements;
            (2) minimize the regulatory burden on United States 
        institutions of higher education performing federally funded 
        research while maintaining accountability for Federal tax 
        dollars; and
            (3) identify and update specific regulations to refocus on 
        performance-based goals rather than on process while still 
        meeting the desired outcome.
    (c) Stakeholder Input.--In carrying out the responsibilities under 
subsection (b), the working group shall take into account input and 
recommendations from non-Federal stakeholders, including federally
