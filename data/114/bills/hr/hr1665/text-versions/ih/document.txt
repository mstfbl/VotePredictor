              GAS AND LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GAS.

            (1) In general.--Subparagraph (B) of section 4041(a)(2) of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking 
        ``and'' at the end of clause (i), by redesignating clause (ii)

        following new clause:
                            ``(ii) in the case of liquefied petroleum 
                        gas, 18.3 cents per energy equivalent of a 
                        gallon of gasoline, and''.
            (2) Energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline.--Paragraph 
        (2) of section 4041(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(C) Energy equivalent of a gallon of gasoline.--
                For purposes of this paragraph, the term `energy 
                equivalent of a gallon of gasoline' means, with respect 
                to a liquefied petroleum gas fuel, the amount of such 
                fuel having a Btu content of 115,400 (lower heating 
                value). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a Btu 
                content of 115,400 (lower heating value) is equal to 
                5.75 pounds of liquefied petroleum gas.''.

                        gas, 24.3 cents per energy equivalent of a 
                        gallon of diesel.''.
            (2) Energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel.--Paragraph (2) 
        of section 4041(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
        amended by subsection (a)(2), is amended by adding at the end 
        the following:
                    ``(D) Energy equivalent of a gallon of diesel.--For 
                purposes of this paragraph, the term `energy equivalent 
                of a gallon of diesel' means, with respect to a 
                liquefied natural gas fuel, the amount of such fuel 
                having a Btu content of 128,700 (lower heating value). 
                For purposes of the preceding sentence, a Btu content 
                of 128,700 (lower heating value) is equal to 6.06

        by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6) and by 
        inserting after paragraph (4) the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Special rule for liquefied natural gas.--In the case

        product of 50 cents and the per energy equivalent of a gallon 
        of diesel (as defined in section 4041(a)(2)(D)) for the number 
        of gallons of liquefied natural gas sold by the taxpayer for 
        use as a fuel in a motor vehicle or motorboat, sold by the 
        taxpayer for use as a fuel in aviation, or so used by the
