              AFFAIRS.

    (a) Expansion of Opioid Safety Initiative.--
            (1) Inclusion of all medical facilities.--Not later than 
        180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall expand the Opioid Safety 
        Initiative of the Department of Veterans Affairs to include all 
        medical facilities of the Department.
            (2) Guidance.--The Secretary shall establish guidance that 
        each health care provider of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs, before initiating opioid therapy to treat a patient as 
        part of the comprehensive assessment conducted by the health 
        care provider, use the Opioid Therapy Risk Report tool of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs (or any subsequent tool), which 
        shall include information from the prescription drug monitoring 
        program of each participating State as applicable, that 
        includes the most recent information to date relating to the 
        patient that accessed such program to assess the risk for 
        adverse outcomes of opioid therapy for the patient, including 
        the concurrent use of controlled substances such as 
        benzodiazepines, as part of the comprehensive assessment 
        conducted by the health care provider.
            (3) Enhanced standards.--The Secretary shall establish 
        enhanced standards with respect to the use of routine and 
        random urine drug tests for all patients before and during 
        opioid therapy to help prevent substance abuse, dependence, and 
        diversion, including--
                    (A) that such tests occur not less frequently than 
                once each year; and
                    (B) that health care providers appropriately order, 
                interpret and respond to the results from such tests to 
                tailor pain therapy, safeguards, and risk management 
                strategies to each patient.
    (b) Pain Management Education and Training.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out the Opioid Safety

                update to such guideline.
                    (B) The use of evidence-based pain management 
                therapies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, non-
                opioid alternatives, and non-drug methods and 
                procedures to managing pain and related health 
                conditions including medical devices approved or 
                cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for the 
                treatment of patients with chronic pain and 
                complementary alternative medicines.
                    (C) Screening and identification of patients with 
                substance use disorder, including drug-seeking 
                behavior, before prescribing opioids, assessment of 
                risk potential for patients developing an addiction, 
                and referral of patients to appropriate addiction
