  to short sale offers to purchase such homes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Vacant Homes Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. PROMPT RESPONSE REQUIRED.

    (a) Before Foreclosure.--
            (1) 90 days provided to respond.--With respect to a home in 
        foreclosure, the mortgage owner of such home who receives 
        notice from the owner of such home (or from such owner's 
        designee) of a qualified offer to buy such home in a short sale 
        shall, no later than 90 days after receipt of such notice, 
        provide a response to--
                    (A) such homeowner; and
                    (B) the person who made such offer.
            (2) Certification required when owner in imminent 
        default.--If such home is a home in foreclosure only because 
        the owner is in imminent default on a loan secured by a 
        mortgage of such home, a communication from such owner (or 
        designee) to such mortgage owner does not constitute ``notice'' 
        under paragraph (1) unless such owner certifies in such notice 
        that he or she is in imminent default on such loan.
            (3) Contents of response.--A response described under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) state that such mortgage owner accepts the 
                offer; or
                    (B) state that such mortgage owner rejects the 
                offer and adequately provide a reason for such 
                rejection.
            (4) Sufficient responses.--A response described under 
        paragraph (1) which states that such mortgage owner rejects the 
        offer adequately provides a reason for such rejection only if 
        it provides--
                    (A) a counteroffer stating--
                            (i) an alternative price at which the 
                        mortgage owner would approve the offer; and
                            (ii) an economic analysis demonstrating a 
                        reasonable expectation that, within the 1-year 
                        period following the 90-day period under 
                        subsection (a), the home's fair market value 
                        will likely be equal or greater than such 
                        alternative price;
                    (B) proof that the home's title is encumbered such 
                that the transfer of title proposed by the offer is 
                prohibited;
                    (C) proof that another mortgage owner of the home 
                prohibits its being the subject of a short sale; or
                    (D) proof that an enforceable contract between the 
                mortgage owner and another person prohibits the 
                mortgage owner from approving the offer.
    (b) After Foreclosure.--
            (1) 90 days provided to respond.--With respect to a 
        foreclosed home, the owner of such home (or a servicer acting 
        on behalf of the owner) who receives a qualified offer to buy 
        such home shall, no later than 90 days after receipt of such 
        offer, provide a response to the person who made such offer.
            (2) Contents of response.--A response described under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) state that such owner or servicer accepts the 
                offer; or
                    (B) state that such owner or servicer rejects the 
                offer and adequately provide a reason for such 
                rejection.
            (3) Sufficient responses.--A response described under 
        paragraph (1) which states that such mortgage owner rejects the 
        offer adequately provides a reason for such rejection only if 
        it provides--
                    (A) a counteroffer stating--
                            (i) an alternative price at which the 
                        mortgage owner would approve the offer; and
                            (ii) an economic analysis demonstrating a 
                        reasonable expectation that, within the 1-year 
                        period following the 90-day period under 
                        subsection (a), the home's fair market value 
                        will likely be equal or greater than such 
                        alternative price; or
                    (B) proof that the home's title is encumbered such 
                that the transfer of title proposed by the offer is 
                prohibited.

SEC. 3. PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION.

    (a) For Homeowners.--A homeowner who has provided a mortgage owner 
with notice of a qualified offer under section 2(a) and does not within
