                    ``(A) Simple leverage ratio.--The appropriate 
                Federal banking agencies shall issue regulations 
                establishing a minimum simple leverage ratio at no less 
                than 10 percent. The simple leverage ratio requirement 
                shall be consistent with regulations promulgated 
                pursuant to section 38 (relating to prompt corrective 
                action).
                    ``(B) Application to traditional banking 
                organization.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
                law, a traditional banking organization that meets the 
                minimum simple leverage ratio established under 
                subparagraph (A) may elect, by notice to the 
                appropriate Federal banking agencies, to maintain the 
                minimum simple leverage ratio as its sole measure of 
                capital adequacy.
                    ``(C) Exemption from risk-based capital 
                requirement.--The risk-based capital requirement in 
                section 38(c)(1)(A) shall not apply to a traditional 
                banking organization that makes an election under 
                subparagraph (B) and complies with regulations issued 
                in accordance with this paragraph.
                    ``(D) Grace period.--A traditional banking 
                organization that makes an election under subparagraph 
                (B) and fails to maintain the minimum simple leverage 
                ratio described in subparagraph (A) (as determined by 
                the first quarterly report of condition issued after 
                making such an election) shall be exempt from the risk-
                based capital requirement in section 38(c)(1)(A) for a 
                period of 18 months beginning on the date of such 
                determination.
            ``(2) Reservation of authority.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of this subsection, an appropriate Federal banking 
        agency may require additional capital adequacy measures 
        applicable to a newly chartered traditional banking 
        organization or for an individual traditional banking 
        organization if such measures are required to ensure the safety 
        and soundness of the banking organization or to prevent an 
        unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
            ``(3) Definitions.--
                    ``(A) Traditional banking organization.--The term

                        leverage ratio shall not be construed to be a 
                        generally applicable leverage capital 
                        requirement for purposes of section 171 of the

                leverage ratio requirement under section 18(aa)(1)(B) 
                of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a traditional 
                banking organization with a simple leverage ratio of 8 
                percent or more may make an election under such section 
                18(aa)(1)(B) during the 18-month period beginning on 
                the date of the enactment of this Act.

                the end of the 18-month period described under 
                subparagraph (A) to meet the minimum simple leverage 
                ratio, or the organization's election under section 
                18(aa)(1)(B) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act shall 
                be terminated.
