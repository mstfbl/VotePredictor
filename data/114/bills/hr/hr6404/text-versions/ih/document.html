  To permit occupational therapists to conduct the initial assessment 
      visit under a Medicare home health plan of care for certain 
                         rehabilitation cases.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Home Health Flexibility Act 
of 2016''.

SEC. 2. PERMITTING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS TO CONDUCT THE INITIAL 
              ASSESSMENT VISIT UNDER A MEDICARE HOME HEALTH PLAN OF 
              CARE FOR CERTAIN REHABILITATION CASES.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 484.55(a)(2) of title 42, 
Code of Federal Regulations, or any other provision of law, an 
occupational therapist may conduct the initial assessment visit for an 
individual who is eligible for home health services under title XVIII 
of the Social Security Act if the referral order by the physician--
            (1) does not include skilled nursing care;
            (2) includes occupation therapy; and
            (3) includes physical therapy or speech language pathology.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be 
construed to provide for initial eligibility for coverage of home 
health services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act solely on 
the basis of a need for occupational therapy.
