                Foundation may execute a construction agreement with 
                respect to the project.
                    (C) Transmittal to congress.--The Director shall 
                transmit each certification made under subparagraph (B)

                        awardee to ensure project stability and 
                        continuity.

                        identify any financial action that may be

                sources of non-Federal funds received in excess of 
                $50,000 during the award period.
                    (D) Expense reporting.--The Foundation shall
