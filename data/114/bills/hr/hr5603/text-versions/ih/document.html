                                 A BILL


 
  To authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to pay rewards under an 
  asset recovery rewards program to help identify and recover stolen 
assets linked to foreign government corruption and the proceeds of such 
  corruption hidden behind complex financial structures in the United 
                           States and abroad.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    (a) The Act may be cited as the ``Kleptocracy Asset Recovery 
Rewards Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR), a World 
        Bank and United Nations anti-money-laundering effort, estimates 
        that between $20 billion to $40 billion has been lost to 
        developing countries annually through corruption.
            (2) In 2014, more than $480 million in corruption proceeds 
        hidden in bank accounts around the world by former Nigerian 
        dictator Sani Abacha and his co-conspirators was forfeited 
        through efforts by the Department of Justice.
            (3) In 2010, the Department of Justice established the 
        Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, to work in partnership 
        with Federal law enforcement agencies to forfeit the proceeds 
        of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, return 
        those proceeds to benefit the people harmed by these acts of 
        corruption and abuse of office.
            (4) Of the $20 billion to $40 billion lost by developing 
        countries annually through corruption, only about $5 billion 
        has been repatriated in the last 15 years.
            (5) Governments weakened by corruption and loss of assets 
        due to corruption have fewer resources to devote to the fight 
        against terrorism and fewer resources to devote to building 
        strong financial, law enforcement, and judicial institutions to 
        aid in the fight against the financing of terrorism.
            (6) The United States has a number of effective programs to 
        reward individuals who provide valuable information that assist 
        in the identification, arrest, and conviction of criminal 
        actors and their associates, as well as seizure and forfeiture 
        of illicitly derived assets and the proceeds of criminal 
        activity.
            (7) The Internal Revenue Service has the Whistleblower 
        Program, which pays awards to individuals who provide specific 
        and credible information to the IRS if the information results 
        in the collection of taxes, penalties, interest or other 
        amounts from noncompliant taxpayers.
            (8) The Department of State administers rewards programs on 
        international terrorism, illegal narcotics, and transnational 
        organized crime with the goal of bringing perpetrators to 
        justice.
            (9) None of these existing rewards programs specifically 
        provide monetary incentives for identifying and recovering 
        stolen assets linked solely to foreign government corruption, 
        as opposed to criminal prosecutions or civil or criminal 
        forfeitures.
            (10) The recovery of stolen assets linked to foreign 
        government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption may 
        not always involve a BSA violation or lead to a forfeiture 
        action. In such cases there would be no ability to pay rewards 
        under existing Treasury Department authorities.
            (11) Foreign government corruption can take many forms but 
        typically entails government officials stealing, 
        misappropriating, or illegally diverting assets and funds from 
        their own government treasuries to enrich their personal wealth 
        directly through embezzlement or bribes to allow government 
        resources to be expended in ways that are not transparent and 
        may not either be necessary or be the result of open 
        competition. Corruption also includes situations where public 
        officials take bribes to allow government resources to be 
        expended in ways which are not transparent and may not be 
        necessary or the result of open competition. These corrupt 
        officials often use the United States and international 
        financial system to hide their stolen assets and the proceeds 
        of corruption.
            (12) The individuals who come forward to expose foreign 
        governmental corruption and kleptocracy often do so at great 
        risk to their own safety and that of their immediate family 
        members and face retaliation from persons who exercise foreign 
        political or governmental power. Monetary rewards and the 
        potential award of asylum can provide a necessary incentive to 
        expose such corruption and provide a financial means to provide 
        for their well-being and avoid retribution.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that a 
Department of the Treasury stolen asset recovery rewards program to 
help identify and recover stolen financial assets linked to foreign 
government corruption and the proceeds of such corruption hidden behind 
complex financial structures is needed in order to--
            (1) intensify the global fight against corruption; and
            (2) serve United States efforts to identify and recover 
        such stolen assets, forfeit proceeds of such corruption, and, 
        where appropriate and feasible, return the stolen assets or 
        proceeds thereof to the country harmed by the acts of 
        corruption.
