            ``(5) Union square defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `Union Square' means the area for which jurisdiction and 
        control was transferred to the Architect of the Capitol under 
        section 1202 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012 
        (2 U.S.C. 1811 note).''.
