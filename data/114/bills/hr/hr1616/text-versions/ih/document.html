                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize the approval of natural gas pipelines and establish 
deadlines and expedite permits for certain natural gas gathering lines 
                    on Federal land and Indian land.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Natural Gas Gathering Enhancement 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) record volumes of natural gas production in the United 
        States as of the date of enactment of this Act are providing 
        enormous benefits to the United States, including by--
                    (A) reducing the need for imports of natural gas, 
                thereby directly reducing the trade deficit;
                    (B) strengthening trade ties among the United 
                States, Canada, and Mexico;
                    (C) providing the opportunity for the United States 
                to join the emerging global gas trade through the 
                export of liquefied natural gas;
                    (D) creating and supporting millions of new jobs 
                across the United States;
                    (E) adding billions of dollars to the gross 
                domestic product of the United States every year;
                    (F) generating additional Federal, State, and local 
                government tax revenues; and
                    (G) revitalizing the manufacturing sector by--
                            (i) significantly increasing commercial 
                        demand for steel; and
                            (ii) providing abundant and affordable 
                        feedstock;
            (2) natural gas is lost due to venting and flaring, 
        primarily in areas where natural gas infrastructure has not 
        been developed quickly enough, such as States with large 
        quantities of Federal land and Indian land;
            (3) permitting processes can hinder the development of 
        natural gas infrastructure, such as pipeline lines and 
        gathering lines on Federal land and Indian land; and
            (4) additional authority for the Secretary of the Interior 
        to approve natural gas pipelines and gathering lines on Federal 
        land and Indian land would--
                    (A) assist in bringing gas to market that would 
                otherwise be vented or flared; and
                    (B) significantly increase royalties collected by 
                the Secretary of the Interior and disbursed to Federal, 
                State, and tribal governments and individual Indians.
