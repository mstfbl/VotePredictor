                                 A BILL


 
   To enhance the security operations of the Transportation Security 
 Administration and stability of the transportation security workforce 
    by applying the personnel system of Title 5 of the U.S. Code to 
  employees of the Transportation Security Administration who provide 
   screening of all passengers and property, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rights for Transportation Security 
Officers Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists, who 
        underwent airport security screening prior to boarding domestic 
        flights, were able to commandeer four airplanes and use those 
        airplanes to perpetrate the most deadly terrorist attack ever 
        to be executed on United States soil.
            (2) In the aftermath of those attacks, Congress passed the 
        Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted by 
        President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001 (Public Law 107-
        71), to enhance the level of security screening throughout our 
        aviation system and transfer responsibility for such screening 
        from the private sector to a new Federal agency, the 
        Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
            (3) By establishing TSA, Congress and the American public 
        recognized that the highest level of screener performance was 
        directly linked to employment and training standards, pay and 
        benefits, and the creation of an experienced, committed 
        screening workforce.
            (4) The Aviation and Transportation Security Act included a 
        statutory footnote allowing the TSA Administrator to ``employ, 
        appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation'', 
        including the ``terms, and conditions of employment of Federal 
        Service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary 
        determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions 
        of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United 
        States Code''.
            (5) TSA has interpreted the ATSA footnote as applying to 
        the majority of the Transportation Security Officer workforce 
        performing screening functions, while all other Transportation 
        Security Administration employees, including managers, are 
        subject to title 5, United States Code, as incorporated in 
        title 49 of such Code.
            (6) In November 2006, the International Labor Organization 
        ruled that the Bush Administration violated international labor 
        law when it prohibited Transportation Security Officers from 
        engaging in collective bargaining.
            (7) After the Federal Labor Relations Board approved a 
        petition for the election of an exclusive representative, on 
        February 4, 2011, then-TSA Administrator John Pistole issued a 
        binding determination stating in part ``it is critical that 
        every TSA employee feels that he or she has a voice and feels 
        safe raising issues and concerns of all kinds. This is 
        important not just for morale; engagement of every employee is 
        critically important for security''.
            (8) The February 4, 2011, determination was superseded by a 
        second Determination issued on December 29, 2014, changing the 
        previous guideline for collective bargaining and resulting in 
        limitations in the subjects that can be bargained, issues in 
        dispute that may be raised to an independent, third-party 
        neutral decisionmaker (such as an arbitrator or the Merit 
        Systems Protection Board), and barriers to union representation 
        of the Transportation Security Officer workforce.
            (9) Both the 2011 and 2014 determinations cited TSA's 
        authority under section 44935 note of title 59, United States 
        Code, to create a personnel system that denies the 
        Transportation Security Officer workforce the same title 5 
        rights as other Federal workers, including the right to appeal 
        adverse personnel decisions to the Merit Systems Protection 
        Board, fair pay under the General Services wage system, 2011, 
        fair pay and raises under the General Services wage system, 
        including overtime guidelines, access to earned leave, 
        application of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, fair 
        performance appraisals under chapter 73 of title 5, United 
        States Code, and direct protections against employment 
        discrimination found in title 7, United States Code.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
personnel system utilized by the Transportation Security Administration 
pursuant to the authority of section 44935 note of title 49, United 
States Code, provides insufficient workplace protections for the 
Transportation Security Officer workforce, the frontline personnel who 
secure our Nation's aviation system and that such personnel should be 
provided protections under title 5, United States Code.
