              CONTRACT.

    Section 15(l)(2) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(l)(2)(D)) 
is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (E) through (I) as

            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (D) the following new

                    ``(E) review any solicitation for a contract or

                task order or part of the contract or task order is set 
                aside for small business concerns, whether one or more 
                contract or task order awards are reserved for small 
                business concerns under a multiple award contract, or 
                whether or not the solicitation would result in a 
                bundled or consolidated contract (as defined in 
                subsection (s)) or a bundled or consolidated task 
                order;''.
