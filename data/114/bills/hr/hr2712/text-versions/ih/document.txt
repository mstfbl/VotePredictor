                        affordability safe harbors promulgated by the 
                        Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of

                period that such coverage is available to full time 
                employees of the employer; and

        respective missions, and to provide to the Secretary of Health

        tax credits under section 36B of such Code and the cost-sharing

        change in availability of coverage for participating employees.
    (c) Exemption From Reporting Requirement Under Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986.--If, through the system created under subsection (a), an 
employer provides prospective reporting for a calendar year in which a

        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the calendar year in which 
        such plan year ends; and
            (2) such employer shall be treated as satisfying the 
        requirements of section 6056(c) of such Code for the calendar

SEC. 7. ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ACA SUBSIDIES.

    (a) In General.--Except as specified in subsection (b), a 
marketplace (as defined in subsection (d)) may automatically reenroll 
an individual into a qualified health plan (as defined for purposes of 
title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) so long as 
the marketplace--
            (1) redetermines on an annual basis the eligibility of the 
        individual for any advanced premium tax credit or a cost-
        sharing reduction pursuant to section 1412 of the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18082); and
            (2) takes into account, in making such redeterminations, 
        annual changes in premiums and in the Federal poverty level as 
        well as the most recent income data available with respect to 
        the individual involved.
    (b) Reenrollment Limitations.--If a marketplace does not follow the 
processes specified under the section with respect to an individual, 
then the marketplace may not automatically reenroll the individual into 
a qualified health plan with an advanced premium tax credit or a cost-
sharing reduction until the individual provides current income 
information to the marketplace so that eligibility for a credit or 
reduction can be redetermined.
    (c) Comprehensive Guidance Based on Current Guidance.--The 
provisions of this section are intended to generally reflect and be 
consistent with the guidance on annual eligibility redeterminations and 
reenrollments for marketplace coverage issued by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services on April 22, 2015. In carrying out this 
section, the Secretary shall apply rules (whether through guidance or 
otherwise) regarding the annual eligibility redeterminations and 
reenrollments for coverage and for tax credits and cost-sharing 
reduction for individuals through a marketplace that are consistent 
with this section and are at least as comprehensive as the guidance 
(issued on April 22, 2015) applied for coverage for 2016. Such guidance 
shall include provisions that ensure that--
            (1) enrollees eligible to be automatically reenrolled in a 
        qualified health plan and to continue provision of such a tax 
        credit or cost-sharing reduction shall maintain on file with 
        the marketplace (or otherwise provide to the marketplace) an 
        authorization for disclosure of information verifying 
        eligibility for such a credit or cost-sharing reduction;
            (2) the marketplace annually requests updated income 
        information to verify such eligibility; and
            (3) enrollees are provided timely and appropriate notices 
        of the rules regarding annual redeterminations and 
        reenrollments.
    (d) Marketplace Defined.--In this section, the term ``marketplace'' 
means State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange 
established under sections 1311 and 1321 of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18031, 18041), respectively.
