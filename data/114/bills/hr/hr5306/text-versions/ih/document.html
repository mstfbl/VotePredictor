    The Congress recommends the following procedures to make uniform 
and simplify the process by which State legislatures make an 
application, or a rescission of an application, under article V of the 
Constitution to call a convention for proposing amendments to the 
Constitution:
            (1) Officers to transmit and receive applications.--After 
        the adoption by the legislature of a State of an application or 
        rescission, the secretary of state of the State, or if there be 
        no such officer, the person who is charged by the State law 
        with such function, should submit to Congress at least two 
        copies of the resolution or other measure containing the 
        application or rescission, one copy addressed to the President 
        of the Senate, and one copy to the Speaker of the House of 
        Representatives.
            (2) Contents of resolution or measure.--Each copy of the 
        resolution or measure should contain--
                    (A) its exact text, with the authenticating 
                signature of the relevant officer of the legislature; 
                and
                    (B) the date on which the legislature adopted the 
                resolution or measure.
            (3) Incomplete application or rescission.--If a State 
        submits an application or rescission in a manner that is 
        inconsistent with this section, the Clerk of the House or the 
        Secretary of the Senate shall so notify the appropriate State 
        official. That State official may then resubmit the 
        application.
