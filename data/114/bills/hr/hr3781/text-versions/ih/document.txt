Sec. 6. Effective date.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Our Nation's child welfare financing system gives 
        States and Indian tribes few resources to invest in prevention 
        and family services that help keep children safely at home or 
        in the care of other family members.
            (2) Title IV-E of the Social Security Act currently 
        provides States and Indian tribes with mandatory Federal 
        funding support for children only after they are placed in 
        foster care. Title IV-E provides few incentives for State and 
        tribal efforts to prevent the need for out-of-home placements 
        of children or to reduce the time children spend in foster 
        care.
            (3) In contrast, State and tribal innovations implemented 
        through title IV-E waivers suggest that permitting State and 
        tribal spending under title IV-E for front end prevention and 
        family services may help reduce the prevalence and length of 
        foster care placements while maintaining or improving safety 
        and permanency outcomes for children.
            (4) Additionally, State experiences with subsidized 
        guardianship demonstrate that when children cannot remain with 
        their parents, children placed with relatives or kin experience 
        greater stability than children placed with non-relative foster 
        families. Kinship or relative care reduces the emotional trauma 
        associated with separation from parents, helps keep siblings 
        together, and preserves cultural heritage and community bonds. 
        Providing supportive services to relatives and kin can reduce 
        the number of children entering or re-entering foster care.
            (5) At the same time, current Federal funding for broad, 
        community-based, primary prevention programs through title IV-B 
        is too limited to adequately reach the number of families in 
        need.
            (6) Greater access to prevention and family services will 
        help keep children safe and supported at home with their 
        parents or other family members, give States and Indian tribes 
        the flexibility to adapt evidence-based support services to the 
        specific needs of each family, and ensure that States and 
        Indian tribes are held accountable for allocating services in 
        ways that maximize safety and permanency for children, while 
        minimizing the prevalence of lengthy foster care placements.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to enable States to provide enhanced 
support to children and families and prevent foster care placements 
through the provision of time-limited family services and expanded 
kinship supports.

SEC. 4. TIME-LIMITED FAMILY SERVICES UNDER PART E OF TITLE IV OF THE 
              SOCIAL SECURITY ACT.

    (a) Time-Limited Family Services Defined.--Section 475 of such Act 
(42 U.S.C. 675) is amended by adding at the end the following:

        a child described in subparagraph (C) during a 12-month period 
        that begins on a date described in subparagraph (D). Such 
        individuals shall remain eligible for time-limited family 
        services for a full 12-month period without regard to whether 
        any such individuals cease to be described in subparagraph (C) 
        after the period begins.

arrangement is at risk of a disruption or dissolution that would result 
in a foster care placement.''.

                re-entering into foster care, or of being prevented
