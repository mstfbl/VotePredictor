                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 40, United States Code, to direct the Administrator of 
General Services to incorporate bird-safe building materials and design 
        features into public buildings, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Bird-Safe Buildings Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nearly one-third of the 800 bird species in the United 
        States are endangered, threatened, or in significant decline.
            (2) In the United States alone, an estimated 1 billion 
        birds die annually from striking buildings, bridges, and other 
        manmade structures, with glass being one of the primary causes 
        of the deaths.
            (3) Birds have a significant impact on the United States 
        economy, as evidenced by United States Fish and Wildlife 
        Service estimates that the 47 million birdwatchers in the 
        United States contribute $40 billion annually to the Nation's 
        economy.
            (4) The General Services Administration is obligated, under 
        Executive Order 13186, to ``support the conservation intent of 
        the migratory bird conventions by integrating bird conservation 
        principles, measures, and practices into agency activities and 
        by avoiding or minimizing, to the extent practicable, adverse 
        impacts on migratory bird resources when conducting agency 
        actions''.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 33 of title 40, United States Code, is
