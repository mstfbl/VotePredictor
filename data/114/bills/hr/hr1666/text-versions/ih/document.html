        officer) approves the contracting officer's justification with 
        respect to an individual solicitation that a specified number 
        greater than 5 is in the Federal Government's interest. The 
        contracting officer shall provide written documentation of how 
        a maximum number greater than 5 is consistent with the purposes 
        and objectives of the two-phase selection procedures.''; and
