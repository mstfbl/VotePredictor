                                 A BILL


 
To improve the integrity and safety of interstate horseracing, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act 
of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the 
        adulteration or misbranding of any food, drug, or device in 
        interstate commerce.
            (2) The manufacture, delivery, and use of certain 
        performance enhancing drugs in horseracing can constitute 
        violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
            (3) According to a Food and Drug Administration Import 
        Alert titled ``Animal Drug Imported For Use By Racetrack 
        Veterinarians'', the Food and Drug Administration routinely 
        receives complaints from State racetrack authorities about the 
        illegal use of clenbuterol, detomidine hydrochloride, 
        glucosaminoglycan polysulfuric acid ester, hyaluronic acid, and 
        isoxsuprine hydrochloride.
            (4) Currently, nearly every horse participating in 
        interstate horseracing is injected shortly before racing with 
        furosemide, a drug that is approved by the Food and Drug 
        Administration for use in horses only for the treatment of 
        edema.
            (5) Congress enacted the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 
        to regulate interstate commerce with respect to parimutuel 
        wagering on horseracing in order to further the horseracing 
        industry of the United States.
            (6) The use of performance-enhancing drugs in horseracing 
        is widespread in the United States, where no uniform 
        regulations exist with respect to the use of, and testing for, 
        performance-enhancing drugs in interstate horseracing.
            (7) A 2012 New York Times investigation found that, on 
        average, every week 24 horses die racing, a high equine 
        fatality rate likely caused by the misuse of permitted 
        medication and abuse of illegal drugs.
            (8) A 2013 horseracing industry study found that a large 
        majority of parimutuel wagering participants avoid wagering at 
        certain tracks and when certain trainers compete because they 
        assume illegal drug use affects race results.
            (9) Total parimutuel wagering on Thoroughbred horseracing 
        in the United States declined 30 percent from 2002 to 2014.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Interstate off-track wager; horsemen's group; host 
        racing association; off-track betting system.--The terms 
        ``interstate off-track wager'', ``horsemen's group'', ``host 
        racing association'', and ``off-track betting system'' have the 
        meanings given those terms in section 3 of the Interstate 
        Horseracing Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3002).
            (2) Veterinarian-client-patient relationship.--The term 
        ``veterinarian-client-patient relationship'' has the meaning of 
        that term as used in the Principles of Veterinary Medical 
        Ethics of the American Veterinary Medical Association (as in 
        effect on the date of the enactment of this Act).
