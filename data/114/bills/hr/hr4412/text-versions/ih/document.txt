faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements of that section 
and the Commission's procedures under that section, extend the time

construction of the project for up to 3 consecutive 2-year periods from 
the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by the 
Commission.
    (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period required for 
commencement of construction of the project described in subsection (a) 
has expired prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Commission may reinstate the license for the project effective as of 
the date of its expiration and the first extension authorized under 
subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of such expiration.
