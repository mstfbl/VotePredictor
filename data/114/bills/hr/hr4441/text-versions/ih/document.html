SEC. 134. MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination and 
        related barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for 
        minority- and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
        airport-related markets across the Nation. These continuing 
        barriers merit the continuation of the airport disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
            (2) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. 
        This testimony and documentation shows that race- and gender-
        neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address the problem.
            (3) This testimony and documentation demonstrates that 
        discrimination across the Nation poses a barrier to full and 
        fair participation in airport-related businesses of women 
        business owners and minority business owners in the racial 
        groups detailed in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, and has impacted firm development and many aspects 
        of airport-related business in the public and private markets.
            (4) This testimony and documentation provides a strong 
        basis that there is a compelling need for the continuation of 
        the airport disadvantaged business enterprise program and the 
        airport concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program 
        to address race and gender discrimination in airport-related 
        business.

SEC. 136. CRITICAL HABITAT ON OR NEAR AIRPORT PROPERTY.

    (a) Federal Agency Requirements.--The Secretary of Transportation, 
to the maximum extent practicable, shall work with the heads of 
appropriate Federal agencies to ensure that designations of critical 
habitat, as that term is defined in section 3 of the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1532), on or near airport property do not--
            (1) result in conflicting statutory, regulatory, or Federal 
        grant assurance requirements for airports or aircraft 
        operators;
            (2) interfere with the safe operation of aircraft; or
            (3) occur on airport-owned lands that have become 
        attractive habitat for a threatened or endangered species 
        because such lands--
                    (A) have been prepared for future development;
                    (B) have been designated as noise buffer land; or
                    (C) are held by the airport to prevent encroachment 
                of uses that are incompatible with airport operations.
    (b) State Requirements.--In a State where a State agency is 
authorized to designate land on or near airport property for the 
conservation of a threatened or endangered species in the State, the 
Secretary, to the maximum extent practicable, shall work with the State 
in the same manner as the Secretary works with the heads of Federal 
agencies under subsection (a).

SEC. 137. RNAV DEPARTURE PROCEDURES.

    When proposing a new area navigation departure procedure, or 
amending an existing procedure that would direct aircraft between the 
surface and 6,000 feet above ground level over noise sensitive areas, 
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall consider 
the feasibility of dispersal headings or other lateral track variations 
to address community noise concerns, if--
            (1) the affected airport operator, in consultation with the 
        affected community, submits a request to the Administrator for 
        such a consideration;
            (2) the airport operator's request would not, in the 
        judgment of the Administrator, conflict with the safe and 
        efficient operation of the national airspace system; and
            (3) the effect of a modified departure procedure would not 
        significantly increase noise over noise sensitive areas, as 
        determined by the Administrator.

SEC. 138. REVIEW AND NOTIFICATION OF CATEGORICAL EXCLUSIONS GRANTED FOR 
              NEXT GENERATION FLIGHT PROCEDURES.

                decision of the Administrator made between February 14, 
                2012, and September 30, 2014, to grant a categorical 
                exclusion under this subsection with respect to a 
                procedure to be implemented at an OEP airport that was 
                a material change from procedures previously in effect 
                at the airport to determine if the implementation of 
                the procedure had a significant effect on the human

                a significant effect on the human environment in the 
                community in which the airport is located, the 
                Administrator shall--

                        that do not substantially degrade the 
                        efficiencies achieved by the implementation of 
                        the procedure being reviewed.
                    ``(C) Human environment defined.--In this

        dangers to the public safety of operating unmanned aircraft 
        near airports without the appropriate approvals or 
        authorizations; and
