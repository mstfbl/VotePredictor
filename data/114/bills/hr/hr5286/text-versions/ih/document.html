care provider under a contract or sharing agreement entered into 
pursuant to provisions of law other than this section.
    ``(b) Veteran Eligibility.--Eligibility of a veteran for care and 
services under this section shall be determined as if such care or

in a facility of the Department shall apply to veterans receiving care 
and services under this section.
