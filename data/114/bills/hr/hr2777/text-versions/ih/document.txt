                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Commissioner of Social Security to implement certain 
        record keeping recommendations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Integrity Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Individuals can commit various types of fraud against 
        the Government by reporting earnings under deceased 
        individuals' Social Security Numbers (SSNs).
            (2) Various Federal entities rely on the Social Security 
        Administration's (SSA) death information to detect unreported 
        deaths and verify the accuracy of reported deaths.
            (3) The Numident is the SSA's computer database file on all 
        who have applied for a Social Security number. The Office of 
        the Inspector General (OIG) of the SSA conducted an audit and 
        determined that the SSA did not have controls in place to 
        annotate death information on the Numident records of 
        numberholders who exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies 
        and were likely deceased.
            (4) The OIG identified approximately 6.5 million 
        numberholders age 112 or older who did not have death 
        information on the Numident.
            (5) The OIG identified 34 cases in which it appeared that 
        the deceased numberholder's name and Social Security Number 
        (SSN) had been misused. In one instance an employer reported 
        paying wages to someone from 2008 through 2012 using a 
        numberholder's name and SSN that had been born in 1886. SSA 
        payment records indicated that the numberholder died in January 
        1965, but the SSA did not record the numberholder's death on 
        the Numident. SSA continued paying benefits to the 
        numberholder's widow until her death in February 1973. SSA's 
        Master Earning File (MEF) contained no reported earnings 
        information for this numberholder from 1956 through 2007.
            (6) The OIG determined that thousands of the SSNs could 
        have been used to commit identity fraud. For tax years 2006 
        through 2011, SSA received reports that individuals using 
        66,920 SSNs had approximately $3.1 billion in wages, tips, and 
        self-employment income. SSA transferred the earnings to the 
        Earnings Suspense File because the employees' or self-employed 
        individuals' names on the earnings reports did not match the 
        numberholders' names.
            (7) During calendar years 2008 through 2011, employers made 
        4,024 E-Verify inquiries using 3,873 SSNs belonging to 
        numberholders born before June 16, 1901. According to the OIG, 
        these inquiries indicate individuals' attempts to use the SSNs 
        to apply for work.
            (8) The OIG determined that resolving these discrepancies 
        will improve the accuracy and completeness of the Death Master 
        File and help prevent future misuse of these SSNs.
            (9) The American taxpayer deserves to have the surety of 
        knowing that every agency and department within the Federal 
        Government takes the prudent actions necessary to prevent 
        future fraud and waste of hard-earned dollars.
            (10) In line with the OIG's recommendations, the SSA should 
        take proactive action to protect the American taxpayer by 
        ensuring that there are controls in place to annotate death 
        information on the Numident records of numberholders who 
        exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies.
