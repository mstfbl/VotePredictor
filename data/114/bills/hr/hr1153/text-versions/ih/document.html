                        States in time to see such family member alive 
                        if the alien were to be admitted through the

                deemed strictly in the public interest described in 
                this subparagraph only if the alien has assisted the 
                United States Government in a matter, such as a 
                criminal investigation, espionage, or other similar law 
                enforcement activity, and either the alien's presence 
                in the United States is required by the Government or 
                the alien's life would be threatened if the alien were 
                not permitted to come to the United States.
                    ``(D) Limitation on the use of parole authority.--
                The Secretary of Homeland Security may not use the 
                parole authority under this paragraph to permit to come 
                to the United States aliens who have applied for and 
                have been found to be ineligible for refugee status or 
                any alien to whom the provisions of this paragraph do 
                not apply.
                    ``(E) Parole not an admission.--Parole of an alien 
                under this paragraph shall not be considered an 
                admission of the alien into the United States. When the 
                purposes of the parole of an alien have been served, as 
                determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the 
                alien shall immediately return or be returned to the 
                custody from which the alien was paroled and the alien 
                shall be considered for admission to the United States 
                on the same basis as other similarly situated 
                applicants for admission.
                    ``(F) Report to congress.--Not later than 90 days 
                after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary of 
                Homeland Security shall submit a report to the 
                Committees on the Judiciary of the House of 
                Representatives and the Senate describing the number 
                and categories of aliens paroled into the United States 
                under this paragraph. Each such report shall contain 
                information and data concerning the number and 
                categories of aliens paroled, the duration of parole, 
                and the current status of aliens paroled during the 
                preceding fiscal year.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on the first day of the first month beginning more than 60 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON PAROLE PROCEDURES AND STANDARDIZATION OF 
              PAROLE PROCEDURES.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security shall jointly conduct a review, and report to the Judiciary 
Committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, not later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually 
thereafter, regarding the effectiveness of parole and custody 
determination procedures applicable to aliens who have established a 
credible fear of persecution and are awaiting a final determination 
regarding their asylum claim by the immigration courts. The report 
shall include the following:
            (1) An analysis of the rate at which release from detention 
        (including release on parole) is granted to aliens who have 
        established a credible fear of persecution and are awaiting a 
        final determination regarding their asylum claim by the 
        immigration courts throughout the United States, and any 
        disparity that exists between locations or geographical areas, 
        including explanation of the reasons for this disparity and 
        what actions are being taken to have consistent and uniform 
        application of the standards for granting parole.
            (2) An analysis of the effect of the procedures and 
        policies applied with respect to parole and custody 
        determinations both by the Attorney General and the Secretary 
        on the alien's pursuit of their asylum claim before an 
        immigration court.
            (3) An analysis of the effectiveness of the procedures and 
        policies applied with respect to parole and custody 
        determinations both by the Attorney General and the Secretary 
        in securing the alien's presence at the immigration court 
        proceedings.
    (b) Recommendations.--The report should include recommendations 
with respect to whether the existing parole and custody determination 
procedures applicable to aliens who have established a credible fear of 
persecution and are awaiting a final determination regarding their 
asylum claim by the immigration courts both respect the interests of 
aliens and ensure the presence of the aliens at the immigration court 
proceedings. The report should include an assessment on corresponding 
failure to appear rates, inabsentia orders, and absconders.
