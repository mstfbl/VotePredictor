        that a waiver notice fails to comply with paragraph (2) and 
        notifies the State of the reason for such determination not 
        later than 30 days after the date on which the State submits 
        the waiver notice, such waiver notice shall not be effective.

        effective on the first day of the first year that begins after 
        the 60-day period that begins on the date on which notification 
        of the revocation occurs.
