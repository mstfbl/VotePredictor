To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the burial of the 
 cremated remains of persons who served as Women's Air Forces Service 
                 Pilots in Arlington National Cemetery.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. BURIAL OF CREMATED REMAINS IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY OF 
              CERTAIN PERSONS WHOSE SERVICE IS DEEMED TO BE ACTIVE 
              SERVICE.

    (a) In General.--Section 2410 of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(c)(1) The Secretary of the Army shall ensure that under such 
regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the cremated remains of any 
person described in paragraph (2) are eligible for inurnment in 
Arlington National Cemetery with military burial honors in accordance 
with section 1491 of title 10.
    ``(2) A person described in this paragraph is a person whose 
service has been determined to be active duty service pursuant to 
section 401 of the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 
38 U.S.C. 106 note) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.''.
    (b) Applicability.--
            (1) In general.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
        apply with respect to--
                    (A) the remains of a person that are not formally 
                interred or inurned as of the date of the enactment of 
                this Act; and
                    (B) a person who dies on or after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act.
            (2) Formally interred or inurned defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``formally interred or inurned'' means 
        interred or inurned in a cemetery, crypt, mausoleum, 
        columbarium, niche, or other similar formal location.

SEC. 2. REPORT ON CAPACITY OF ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit to the Committees on 
Veterans' Affairs and the Committees on Armed Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate a report on the interment and inurnment 
capacity of Arlington National Cemetery, including--
            (1) the estimated date that the Secretary determines the 
        cemetery will reach maximum interment and inurnment capacity; 
        and
            (2) in light of the unique and iconic meaning of the 
        cemetery to the United States, recommendations for legislative 
        actions and nonlegislative options that the Secretary 
        determines necessary to ensure that the maximum interment and 
        inurnment capacity of the cemetery is not reached until well 
        into the future, including such actions and options with 
        respect to--
                    (A) redefining eligibility criteria for interment 
                and inurnment in the cemetery; and
                    (B) considerations for additional expansion 
                opportunities beyond the current boundaries of the 
                cemetery.
