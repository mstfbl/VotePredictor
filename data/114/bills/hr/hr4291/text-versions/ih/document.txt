SEC. 2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SYRIAN AND IRAQI REFUGEES.

    (a) In General.--Prior to admitting to the United States as a 
refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1157) a covered alien, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
and the Director of National Intelligence, shall ensure that the 
covered alien--
            (1) has taken and passed a lie detector test, as determined 
        by the Secretary;
            (2) has submitted to the Secretary biometric identification 
        information, including DNA, which the Secretary has compared 
        against all relevant databases and determined that the covered 
        alien has no known history of engaging in terrorist activity 
        (as such term is defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(iv) of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv))); 
        and
            (3) does not pose a threat to the national security of the 
        United States based on a background check that the Secretary 
        conducts, which includes a review of the covered alien's 
        interactions on and posting of material to the Internet 
        (including social media services), and for purposes of which, 
        the alien has submitted to the Secretary such information as 
        the Secretary determines necessary.
    (b) Covered Alien.--The term ``covered alien'' means an alien 
applying for admission to the United States as a refugee who--
            (1) is a national of Iraq or Syria;
            (2) has no nationality and whose last habitual residence 
        was in Iraq or Syria; or
            (3) has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or 
        after March 1, 2011.
    (c) Sunset.--This Act shall cease to have effect on the date that 
is 10 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
