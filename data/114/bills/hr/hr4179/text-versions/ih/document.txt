                                 A BILL


 
     To direct the Federal Communications Commission to promulgate 
regulations requiring material in the online public inspection file of 
   a covered entity to be made available in a format that is machine-
                               readable.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair and Clear Campaign Transparency 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama issued an 
        Executive order that made open and machine-readable data the 
        new default for Government information.
            (2) Open data principles are essential for transparency and 
        efficiency in government.
            (3) In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission required 
        television stations to place on the Internet website of the 
        Commission certain materials in the files such stations are 
        required to maintain and make available for public inspection, 
        including important information about the purchasing of 
        political advertisements.
            (4) The Commission declined to require such materials to be 
        machine-readable, deciding at the time that it was more 
        important to get the information online faster.
            (5) Machine readability is a critical component of open 
        government and provides interested parties with the necessary 
        access to evaluate data in a more comprehensive way.

SEC. 3. MATERIAL IN ONLINE PUBLIC INSPECTION FILE REQUIRED TO BE IN 
              MACHINE-READABLE FORMAT.

    (a) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations that 
require a covered entity, to the extent such entity is required to make

upload such material to, an Internet website, to make such material 
available or upload such material in a format that is machine-readable.
    (b) Applicability.--The regulations promulgated under subsection 
(a) shall apply--
