providers to furnish hospital care, medical services, and extended care 
                              to veterans.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans Affairs 
Purchased Health Care Streamlining and Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. AGREEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 17 of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended by inserting after section 1703 the following 
new section:
``Sec. 1703A. Veterans Care Agreements with certain health care 
              providers
    ``(a) Veterans Care Agreements.--(1) In addition to furnishing 
hospital care, medical services, or extended care under this chapter at 
facilities of the Department or under contracts or sharing agreements 
entered into pursuant to provisions of law other than this section, the 
Secretary may furnish such care and services to eligible veterans 
through the use of agreements entered into under this section by the 
Secretary with eligible providers.
    ``(2) The Secretary may enter into Veterans Care Agreements under 
this section with eligible providers to furnish hospital care, medical 
services, and extended care to veterans whom the Secretary determines 
that furnishing such care and services at facilities of the Department 
or under contracts or sharing agreements under provisions of law other 
than this section is impracticable or inadvisable because of the 
medical condition of the veteran, the travel involved, or the nature of 
the care or services required, or a combination of such factors.
    ``(b) Veteran Eligibility.--Eligibility of a veteran for care and 
services under this section shall be determined as if such care or 
services were furnished in a facility of the Department, and provisions 
of this title applicable to veterans receiving such care and services 
in a facility of the Department shall apply to veterans receiving care 
and services under this section.
    ``(c) Provider Eligibility.--Subject to the certification process 
pursuant to subsection (d)(1), a provider of hospital care, medical 
services, or extended care is eligible to enter into a Veterans Care 
Agreement under this section if the Secretary determines that the 
provider meets each of the following criteria:
            ``(1) The gross annual revenue of the provider in the year 
        preceding the year in which the provider enters into the 
        Veterans Care Agreement does not exceed $11,000,000 (as 
        adjusted in a manner similar to amounts adjusted pursuant to 
        section 5312 of this title).
            ``(2) The provider does not otherwise provide such care or 
        services to patients pursuant to a contract entered into with a 
        department or agency of the Federal Government.
            ``(3) The provider is--

                U.S.C. 3002)); or
                    ``(E) a center for independent living (as defined 
                in section 702 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
                U.S.C. 796a)).
            ``(4) Any additional criteria determined appropriate by the 
        Secretary.
    ``(d) Provider Certification.--(1) The Secretary shall establish a 
process for the certification of eligible providers to enter into

        of certifications and the revocation of certifications.
            ``(C) Procedures for assessing eligible providers based on 
        the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse of such providers similar 
        to the level of screening under section 1866(j)(2)(B) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395(j)(2)(B)) and the standards
