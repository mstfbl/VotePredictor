                                 AN ACT


 
  To support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the capacity of 
  partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, designate major 
        wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Poaching 
Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Poaching and the illicit trade in endangered 
        and threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal 
        activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion 
        annually.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Poaching and wildlife trafficking have 
        escalated in scale, sophistication and violence, risking the 
        potential extinction of some of the world's most iconic 
        species.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten 
        elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have 
        devastating impact on a number of other species, including 
        sharks, great apes, and turtles.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The high demand for rare wildlife products has 
        driven prices to historically high levels.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Much of the demand for wildlife products comes 
        from Asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and 
        social status associated with these products.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Reporting indicates that a number of rebel 
        groups and terrorist organizations, including Sudan's Janjaweed 
        militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, the Seleka rebel movement 
        in the Central African Republic, and Somalia's al-Shabaab, 
        either participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife 
        trafficking networks.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Analyses suggest the high demand for illegal 
        wildlife products, combined with weak law enforcement and 
        security measures and corruption and governance failures, has 
        led to the increased involvement of transnational organized 
        crime in wildlife trafficking.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) The United Nations Security Council has 
        authorized multilateral sanctions against individuals and 
        entities supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in 
        wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the 
        Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African 
        Republic.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) A National Intelligence Council analysis of 
        wildlife poaching threats found that certain African government 
        officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and 
        that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and 
        trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of 
        law.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) On November 13, 2013, the Secretary of State 
        announced the first reward under the Transnational Organized 
        Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the 
        dismantling of the Xaysavang Network, a large wildlife 
        trafficking syndicate that is based in Laos and spans Africa 
        and Asia.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT NETWORKS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Wildlife enforcement networks are government-
        led, regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and 
        coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental 
        agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife 
        trafficking of member countries.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Currently there are active wildlife 
        enforcement networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central 
        America. The more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as 
        the Southeast Asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven 
        effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking 
        networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved in 
        the illegal trade of endangered and threatened 
        species.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Efforts are underway to establish additional 
        wildlife enforcement networks in Central Africa, the Horn of 
        Africa, South America, and Central and West Asia, among other 
        regions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Statement of Policy.--The Secretary of State, the 
Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
Development, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies should, in an effort 
to address regional threats to biodiversity and conservation, support 
strengthening existing wildlife enforcement networks and the 
establishment of new networks in other appropriate regions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
in the process of strengthening and expanding wildlife enforcement 
networks, the appropriate agencies should--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) assess the existing capacity of wildlife 
        enforcement network member countries to gather baseline data 
        that may be used for developing program activities for the 
        wildlife enforcement network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) establish a central secretariat within each 
        wildlife enforcement network that will coordinate the 
        operational mechanisms of each such network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) establish a focal mechanism in each member 
        country of a wildlife enforcement network, that includes 
        representatives from environmental and wildlife protection 
        agencies, law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence 
        units, customs and border protection agencies, and the 
        judiciary system, that will serve as a conduit to the larger 
        wildlife enforcement network and the central 
        secretariat;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) strengthen cooperation and the capacity of law 
        enforcement agencies of the wildlife enforcement 
        network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) facilitate the sharing of intelligence and 
        relevant case information within the agencies of a wildlife 
        enforcement network;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) support the cooperation and coordination 
        between different regional wildlife enforcement 
        networks;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) incorporate and utilize expertise from 
        international bodies and civil society organizations that have 
        appropriate subject matter expertise;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) eventually create an institutionalized, 
        sustainable, and self-sufficient platform; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) recognize that lawful, well regulated hunting 
        can contribute to sustainability and economic development, and 
        that enforcement policies should not discourage or impede this 
        activity.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. SUPPORTING THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE WILDLIFE LAW 
              ENFORCEMENT SECTOR.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Development, the Director of the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate 
agencies, including the National Park Service and the United States 
Forest Service, should, in an effort to address local and regional 
threats to biodiversity and conservation and support the rule of law 
and good governance, promote the professionalization of the wildlife 
law enforcement sector and professional ranger training in partner 
countries through support and technical assistance for the 
following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The creation and adoption of standards for 
        professional ranger training and qualifications, including in 
        relevant international fora and multilateral 
        agreements.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Training and accreditation systems based on 
        the standards described in paragraph (1) that produce 
        professionally trained and qualified rangers and promote the 
        overall professionalization of ranger forces, whether through 
        existing United States institutions, such as International Law 
        Enforcement Academies, or through partnerships with national or 
        regional training institutions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Legal reforms, where necessary, to provide 
        rangers with authority to detain and arrest suspects, process 
        crime scenes, present evidence in court, and defend themselves 
        in life threatening situations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The development and institutionalization of 
        reward and promotion systems for rangers based on performance 
        and set competencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) The development and institutionalization of 
        national systems to provide insurance to rangers and their 
        families and compensation for those rangers killed in the line 
        of duty.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Cooperation and coordination between local law 
        enforcement tasked with wildlife or park protection and local 
        defense forces, where appropriate, including training 
        opportunities, logistical support, or provision of 
        equipment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        endangered or threatened species; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) include a short justification for each 
        determination made under paragraph (1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Withholding of Assistance.--The Secretary of State may 
withhold assistance described in subsection (d) with respect to each 
foreign country that is specially designated under subsection

              COUNTER WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND POACHING IN 
              AFRICA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should 
continue to provide defense articles (not including significant 
military equipment), defense services, and related training to 
appropriate security forces of countries of Africa for the purposes of 
countering wildlife trafficking and poaching.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
