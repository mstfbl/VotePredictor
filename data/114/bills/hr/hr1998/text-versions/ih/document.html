    Child Rescue Corps, a Cyber Crimes Center, a Child Exploitation 
Investigations Unit, a Computer Forensics Unit, and a Cyber Crimes Unit 
    to support the mission of the Homeland Security Investigations

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Human 
Exploitation Rescue Operations Act of 2015'' or the ``HERO Act of 
2015''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution 
        of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the 
        United States. International demand for this material creates a 
        powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of children 
        within the United States.
            (2) The targeting of United States children by 
        international criminal networks is a threat to the homeland 
        security of the United States. This threat must be fought with 
        trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-
        exploitation strategies and technologies.
            (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical 
        national security role in protecting the United States from the 
        growing international threat of child exploitation and human 
        trafficking.
            (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States 
        Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national 
        resource in the effort to combat international child 
        exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in 
        investigations, computer forensics, and victim identification.
            (5) The returning military heroes of the United States 
        possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law 
        enforcement in combating global sexual and child exploitation, 
        and the Department of Homeland Security should use this 
        national resource to the maximum extent possible.
            (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) 
        Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of 
        the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes 
        of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue 
        children from sexual abuse and slavery.
