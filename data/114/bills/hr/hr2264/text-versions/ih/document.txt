unscheduled military flights within the continental United States and 
on scheduled overseas flights operated by the Air Mobility Command on a

transportation is provided to members of the armed forces entitled to 
retired or retainer pay.
    ``(2) The transportation priority required by paragraph (1) for 
veterans described in such paragraph applies whether or not the 
Secretary establishes the travel program authorized by this section.
