  To require certain States to retain the Congressional redistricting 
   plans in effect as of the first day of the One Hundred Fourteenth 
 Congress until such States carry out a redistricting plan in response 
  to the apportionment of Representatives resulting from the regular 
                  decennial census conducted in 2020.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Citizens' 
Districts Preservation Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress has the power to determine the boundaries of 
        districts for the election of Representatives in Congress, as 
        well as the process by which such boundaries are to be drawn, 
        pursuant to the authority given to Congress to make or alter 
        regulations of the times, places, and manner of holding 
        elections for Representatives by article I, section 4 of the 
        Constitution.
            (2) The actions of citizens to establish, within the bounds 
        of their State constitutions, commissions to draw the 
        boundaries of districts for the election of Representatives 
        from their States should be upheld.
            (3) Between the reapportionment of Representatives 
        resulting from the regular decennial census, it is preferable 
        to maintain the stability and continuity of the boundaries of 
        these districts.
