SEC. 503. STUDY OF FINANCING FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS 
              TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

    (a) Analysis of Information and Communications Technology Industry 
Use of Bank Products.--The Export-Import Bank of the United States (in 
this section referred to as the ``Bank'') shall conduct a study of the 
extent to which the products offered by the Bank are available and used 
by companies that export information and communications technology 
services and related goods.
    (b) Elements.--In conducting the study required by subsection (a), 
the Bank shall examine the following:
            (1) The number of jobs in the United States that are 
        supported by the export of information and communications 
        technology services and related goods, and the degree to which 
        access to financing will increase exports of such services and 
        related goods.
            (2) The reduction in the financing by the Bank of exports 
        of information and communications technology services from 2003 
        through 2014.
            (3) The activities of foreign export credit agencies to 
        facilitate the export of information and communications 
        technology services and related goods.
            (4) Specific proposals for how the Bank could provide 
        additional financing for the exportation of information and 
        communications technology services and related goods through 
        risk-sharing with other export credit agencies and other third 
        parties.
            (5) Proposals for new products the Bank could offer to 
        provide financing for exports of information and communications 
        technology services and related goods, including--
                    (A) the extent to which the Bank is authorized to 
                offer new products;
                    (B) the extent to which the Bank would need 
                additional authority to offer new products to meet the 
                needs of the information and communications technology 
                industry;
                    (C) specific proposals for changes in law that 
                would enable the Bank to provide increased financing 
                for exports of information and communications 
                technology services and related goods in compliance 
                with the credit and risk standards of the Bank;
                    (D) specific proposals that would enable the Bank 
                to provide increased outreach to the information and 
                communications technology industry about the products 
                the Bank offers; and
                    (E) specific proposals for changes in law that 
                would enable the Bank to provide the financing to build 
                information and communications technology 
                infrastructure, in compliance with the credit and risk 
                standards of the Bank, to allow for market access 
                opportunities for United States information and 
                communications technology companies to provide services 
                on the infrastructure being financed by the Bank.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Bank shall submit to Congress a report that 
contains the results of the study required by subsection (a).
