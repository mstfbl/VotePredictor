SEC. 107. STUDY OF FINANCING FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS 
              TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.

    (a) Analysis of the Information and Communications Technology 
Industry Use of Bank Products.--The Export-Import Bank of the United 
States (in this section referred to as the ``Bank'') shall conduct a 
study of the extent to which the products offered by the Bank are 
available and used by companies that export services and related goods. 
In conducting the study, the Bank shall examine the following:
            (1) The impediments to the use of Bank products by the 
        companies.
            (2) The number of jobs in the United States that are 
        supported by the export of goods and services, and the degree 
        to which access to financing will increase exports.
            (3) The reduction in the financing by the Bank of 
        information and communications technology (in this section 
        referred to as ``ICT'') services from 2003 through 2013.
            (4) The impediments posed by local content requirements to 
        ICT companies that seek to use a Bank product.
            (5) The activities of foreign export credit agencies to 
        facilitate the export of ICT goods and services.
            (6) Specific proposals for how the Bank, using its 
        authority and products, could provide additional financing for 
        ICT goods and services, including through risk-sharing with 
        other export credit agencies and other third parties.
            (7) Ways in which the Bank can take into account the full 
        global ICT goods and services supply chain--in particular, the 
        ultimate manufacturer or provider of the finished goods or 
        services that would result from the supply chain--in making 
        credit and risk determinations and the creditworthiness of the 
        ultimate purchaser.
            (8) Proposals for new products the Bank could offer to 
        provide the financing, including--
                    (A) the extent to which the Bank is authorized to 
                offer new products;
                    (B) the extent to which the Bank would need 
                additional authority to offer the new products to meet 
                the needs of the ICT industry;
                    (C) specific proposals for changes in law that 
                would enable the Bank to provide increased financing 
                for ICT goods and services in compliance with the 
                credit and risk standards of the Bank;
                    (D) specific proposals that would enable the Bank 
                to provide increased outreach to the ICT industry about 
                the products the Bank offers; and
                    (E) specific proposals for changes in law that 
                would enable the Bank to provide the financing to build 
                ICT infrastructure in compliance with the credit and 
                risk standards of the Bank so as to allow for market 
                access opportunities for United States ICT companies to 
                operate services on the infrastructure being financed 
                on receipt of funds from the Bank.
