            ``(4) Additional administrative conditions.--No non-Federal 
        property may be included in the park without the written 
        consent of the owner. The establishment of the park or the 
        management of the park shall not be construed to create buffer 
        zones outside of the park. That activities or uses can be seen, 
        heard or detected from areas within the park shall not 
        preclude, limit, control, regulate, or determine the conduct or 
        management of activities or uses outside of the park.''.
