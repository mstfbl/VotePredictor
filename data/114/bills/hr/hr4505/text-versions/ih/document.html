                        against the terms of the consortium's most 
                        recent designation under paragraph (1) and any 
                        post-designation awards the consortium may have 
                        received.
                            (ii) The progress the consortium has made 
                        with respect to project-specific metrics the 
                        consortium proposed in the consortium's 
                        application for the most recent designation 
                        under paragraph (1), particularly with respect 
                        to those metrics that were designed to help 
                        communities track their own progress.
                            (iii) Whether any changes to the

                        described in clause (i) of subparagraph (C), or

                        clause (ii) of such subparagraph would improve 
                        the competitiveness of United States 
                        manufacturing.
                            (iv) Such other criteria as the Secretary 
                        considers appropriate.

                        metrics, benchmarks, and milestones that the 
                        consortium will track and the evaluation 
                        methods the consortium will use while 
                        designated as a manufacturing community to 
                        gauge performance of the strategy of the 
                        consortium to improve the manufacturing in the

                proposal.
                    (B) How the manufacturing concentration of the

        of the Department of Commerce before the date of the enactment 
        of this Act shall be deemed a manufacturing community 
        designated under this subsection as long as such consortium is 
        still designated as a manufacturing community by the Secretary 
        as part of such initiative.
