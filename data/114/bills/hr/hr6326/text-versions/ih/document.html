                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit any new major rule from taking effect until the Secretary 
of Labor conducts a study to determine the impact of such rule on wages 
                            and employment.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Impact on Employment and 
Wages Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The median wage in the United States is the same today 
        as it was in 2007.
            (2) Since 2009, the average income of individuals making 
        incomes in the top 1 percent grew by 11.2 percent in real 
        terms, while individuals with incomes in the bottom 99 percent 
        saw their incomes decrease by 0.4 percent.
            (3) Since 2009, the Administration has created over $600 
        billion in new regulatory costs related to major rules.
            (4) Federal regulations account for roughly $2 trillion in 
        lost economic growth.
            (5) For every $1 billion in new regulatory costs, affected 
        industry employment declines by 3.6 percent.
            (6) Regulatory costs disproportionally impact lower and 
        middle income Americans the most with higher cost of goods, 
        lower wages, and less economic opportunity.

SEC. 3. WAGE STUDY.

    No major rule proposed by a Federal agency on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act may take effect as a final rule, until the 
Secretary of Labor (acting through the Bureau of Labor Statistics)--
            (1) conducts a study to the determine the extent to which 
        such rule will impact--
                    (A) wage growth (including for hourly and part-time 
                workers) in each industry to which such rule is 
                applicable; and
                    (B) employment in each such industry;
            (2) submits the results of such study to Congress; and
            (3) makes such study publicly available on the website of 
        the Department of Labor.

SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT REGARDING WAGE STUDY.

    The requirement to conduct a study under section 3 may not be 
fulfilled by a study conducted prior to the date of enactment of this 
Act, or conducted by another agency.

SEC. 5. DEFINITION.

    In this Act, the term ``major rule'' has the meaning given the term 
in section 804 of title 5, United States Code.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
