                qualifying serious violent felony) who, before the date 
                of enactment of this Act, was convicted of an offense 
                for which the penalty is amended by this section and 
                who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the

                on its own motion, upon prior notice to the Government, 
                reduce the term of imprisonment for the offense, after 
                considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) of 
                title 18, United States Code, the nature and 
                seriousness of the danger to any person or the 
                community, and the post-sentencing conduct of the 
                defendant, if such a reduction is consistent with this 
                section and the amendments made by this section.
                    (B) Definition.--In this paragraph the term 
                ``qualifying serious violent felony'' means an offense 
                that--
                            (i) is a serious violent felony as that 
                        term is defined in section 102(58) of the

                        criminal history points as determined under the 
                        United States Sentencing Guidelines.

                determined under the sentencing guidelines;
                    ``(B) a prior 3-point offense, as determined under 
                the sentencing guidelines; and

                offense, as determined under the sentencing 
                guidelines;''; and

    ``(g) Inadequacy of Criminal History.--
            ``(1) In general.--If subsection (f) does not apply to a 
        defendant because the defendant does not meet the requirements 
        described in subsection (f)(1) (relating to criminal history), 
        the court may, upon prior notice to the Government, waive 
        subsection (f)(1) if the court specifies in writing the 
        specific reasons why reliable information indicates that 
        excluding the defendant pursuant to subsection (f)(1) 
        substantially overrepresents the seriousness of the defendant's 
        criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will 
        commit other crimes.
            ``(2) Prohibition.--This subsection shall not apply to any 
        defendant who has been convicted of a serious drug felony or a

        that is punishable by imprisonment under any law of the United 
        States, or of a State or foreign country, that prohibits or 
        restricts the importation, manufacture, or distribution of 
        controlled substances or the possession of controlled 
        substances with intent to distribute; and

        violence', as defined in section 16, that is punishable by 
        imprisonment.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section shall apply 
only to a conviction entered on or after the date of enactment of this 
Act.

SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON APPLICATION OF THE 10-YEAR MANDATORY MINIMUM.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 3553 of title 18, United States Code, as 
amended by section 3, is amended by adding at the end the following:

Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960 and 963) for which the statutory 
minimum term of imprisonment is 10 years, the court may impose a 
sentence as if the statutory minimum term of imprisonment was 5 years, 
if the court finds at sentencing, after the Government has been 
afforded the opportunity to make a recommendation, that--
            ``(1) the defendant does not have a prior conviction for a 
        serious drug felony or serious violent felony as defined in 
        paragraphs (57) and (58), respectively, of section 102 of the 
        Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802) that was made final 
        prior to the commission of the instant offense;

        threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous 
        weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection 
        with the offense, and the offense did not result in death or 
        serious bodily injury to any person;
            ``(3) the defendant did not play an enhanced role in the 
        offense by acting as an organizer, leader, manager, or 
        supervisor of other participants in the offense, as determined 
        under the sentencing guidelines, or by exercising substantial 
        authority or control over the criminal activity of a criminal 
        organization, regardless of whether the defendant was a member 
        of such organization;
            ``(4) the defendant did not act as an importer, exporter, 
        high-level distributor or supplier, wholesaler, or manufacturer 
        of the controlled substances involved in the offense or engage 
        in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in section 408 
        of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 848);
            ``(5) the defendant did not distribute a controlled 
        substance to or with a person under 18 years of age; and

        information and evidence the defendant has concerning the 
        offense or offenses that were part of the same course of 
        conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the 
        defendant has no relevant or useful other information to 
        provide or that the Government is already aware of the 
        information shall not preclude a determination by the court 
        that the defendant has complied with this requirement.
    ``(j) Definitions.--As used in subsection (i) of this section--
            ``(1) the term `importer, exporter, or high-level 
        distributor or supplier'--

                    (A) General rule.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), in the case of a defendant who,

                of an offense for which the penalty is amended by this 
                section and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 
                the offense, the sentencing court may, on motion of the

                reduce the term of imprisonment for the offense, after 
                considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) of 
                title 18, United States Code, the nature and 
                seriousness of the danger to any person or the

                section and the amendments made by this section.
                    (B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) does not apply in 
                the case of an offense affected by the amendment made 
                in subsection (a)(2) with regard to a defendant who has 
                a prior conviction for a serious violent felony, as 
                defined in section 102(58) of the Controlled Substances 
                Act.

SEC. 6. AMENDMENT TO CERTAIN PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN FIREARM OFFENSES AND 
              ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL PROVISION.

    (a) Amendments.--Section 924 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by striking ``not more than 10 
        years'' and inserting ``not more than 15 years''; and
            (2) in subsection (e)(1), by striking ``not less than 15 
        years'' and inserting ``not less than 10 years''.
    (b) Applicability to Pending and Past Cases.--
            (1) Pending cases.--This section, and the amendments made 
        by this section, shall apply to any offense that was committed 
        before the date of enactment of this Act, if a sentence for the 
        offense has not been imposed as of such date of enactment.
            (2) Past cases.--In the case of a defendant (other than a 
        defendant with a prior conviction for a serious violent felony, 
        as defined in section 102(58) of the Controlled Substances Act) 
        who, before the date of enactment of this Act, was convicted of 
        an offense for which the penalty is amended by this section and 
        was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the offense, the 
        sentencing court may, on motion of the defendant or the 
        Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, upon 
        prior notice to the Government, reduce the term of imprisonment 
        for the offense, after considering the factors set forth in 
        section 3553(a) of title 18, United States Code, the nature and 
        seriousness of the danger to any person or the community, and 
        the post-sentencing conduct of the defendant, if such a 
        reduction is consistent with this section and the amendments 
        made by this section.

SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF FAIR SENTENCING ACT.

    (a) Definition of Covered Offense.--In this section, the term 
``covered offense'' means a violation of a Federal criminal statute, 
the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of 
the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372), 
that was committed before August 3, 2010.
    (b) Defendants Previously Sentenced.--A court that imposed a 
sentence for a covered offense, may, on motion of the defendant, the 
Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the attorney for the Government, or 
the court, impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair 
Sentencing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372) were in 
effect at the time the covered offense was committed.
    (c) Limitations.--No court shall entertain a motion made under this 
section to reduce a sentence if the sentence was imposed or reduced to 
a sentence greater than the applicable mandatory minimum in accordance 
with the amendments made by sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act 
of 2010 (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372), or if a motion made 
pursuant to section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act or under this 
section was denied by a court because a reduction in the defendant's 
term of imprisonment would pose a danger to any person or the community 
or was denied by a court because of the defendant's post-sentencing 
conduct. Nothing in this section shall require a court to reduce any 
sentence pursuant to this section.
