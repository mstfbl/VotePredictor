    Congress makes the followings findings:
            (1) Federal transportation research and development 
        planning and coordination--
                    (A) should occur within the Office of the Secretary 
                of Transportation; and
                    (B) should be, to the extent practicable,

SEC. 7. INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) In General.--The Assistant Secretary of Transportation for 
Research and Technology, as part of the Intelligent Transportation 
Systems research program, with the goal of reducing traffic congestion 
and vehicle crashes and accelerating testing and research on the 
introduction of safe, connected, and automated vehicle technology 
systems, shall--
            (1) seek to identify and understand--
                    (A) new and innovative vehicle technologies, 
                including active safety technologies, and their safe 
                application in vehicles; and
                    (B) emerging vehicle technologies and advanced 
                communications and sensing techniques that may require 
                additional exploration and understanding by the 
                Department of Transportation of how such technologies 
                work alone and in conjunction with other vehicle and 
                relevant nonvehicle technologies;
            (2) assess wireless technologies' capabilities to achieve a 
        deployable system in which vehicles of all types (including 
        automobiles, trucks, motor coaches, transit vehicles, and other 
        fleets), traffic signals, other infrastructure systems, 
        pedestrians, motorcyclists, bicyclists, and mobile devices can 
        interact with and among each other through secure 
        communications, including by conducting rigorous, real-world 
        testing, in cooperation with representatives of the Federal 
        Communications Commission, the National Telecommunications and 
        Information Administration, the automotive, Wi-Fi, cellular, 
        and Intelligent Transportation Systems communities, of viable 
        spectrum sharing technologies that could enable the safe 
        operation of unlicensed devices, including Wi-Fi, in the 5.9 
        GHz band without interfering with connected and automated 
        vehicle communications; and
            (3) assist in the development of cybersecurity standards in 
        cooperation with relevant modal administrations of the 
        Department of Transportation and other Federal agencies, 
        including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
        to help prevent hacking, spoofing, and disruption of connected 
        and automated transportation applications among surface 
        transportation vehicles of all types.
    (b) Report.--Upon completion of the testing described in subsection 
(a)(2), the Secretary of Transportation shall send to Congress and the 
Federal Communications Commission, and publish on a public website, a 
report identifying any potential signal interference risks to connected 
and automated vehicle communications that may exist due to unlicensed 
devices, including Wi-Fi, operating in the 5.9 GHz band, including a 
determination of whether such devices can safely operate in the 5.9 GHz 
band without creating signal interference that could jeopardize or 
delay the deployment of an effective connected and automated vehicle 
communications system.
    (c) Analysis.--In carrying out this section, the Assistant 
Secretary of Transportation for Research and Technology shall document 
and analyze the technologies described in subsection (a), and share 
results of the analysis with the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration annually.
    (d) Privacy.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary and the 
Assistant Secretary shall ensure the privacy of individuals.
    (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``active safety 
technologies'' means technologies which actively assist drivers or 
vehicles in preventing or mitigating a crash.

SEC. 8. RAIL SAFETY.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Research and Technology shall 
transmit to Congress a report containing--
            (1) the results of a study to examine the state of rail 
        safety technologies and an analysis of whether the passenger, 
        commuter, and transit rail transportation industries are 
        keeping up with innovations in technologies to make rail cars 
        safer for passengers and transport of commerce;
            (2) a determination of how much additional time and public 
        and private resources will be required for railroad carriers to 
        meet the positive train control system implementation 
        requirements under section 20157 of title 49, United States 
        Code; and
            (3) an identification of technologies that in whole or in 
        part achieve the safety goals of the positive train control 
        implementation requirements under section 20157 that could be 
        implemented sooner than positive train control systems, along 
        with an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, including 
        costs, of incorporating those alternative technologies to 
        supplement or substitute for positive train control systems.
