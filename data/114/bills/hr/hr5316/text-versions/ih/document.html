114th CONGRESS
  2d Session
                                H. R. 5316

   To establish a carbon sequestration pilot program under which the 
  Secretary of the Interior may make grants for projects to evaluate 
 methods to increase the amount of carbon captured on qualified public 
     lands in order to achieve a wide range of benefits, including 
  reductions in greenhouse gases, increased water retention and water 
 quality in watersheds, nutrient cycling, reduced erosion, and forage 
                                quality.
