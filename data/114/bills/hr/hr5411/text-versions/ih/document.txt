  To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide under the 
  State plan under the Medicaid program early and periodic screening, 
diagnostic, and treatment services to individuals under age 21 who are

    (a) Providing Full-Range of EPSDT Services to Children in IMDs.--
Section 1905(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(h)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(3) Such term includes the full-range of early and periodic 
screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (as defined in subsection 
(r)), whether or not furnished by the provider of the services 
described in paragraph (1).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendment 
        made by subsection (a) shall apply to items and services 
        furnished on or after the date of the enactment of this 
        section.
            (2) Exception for state legislation.--In the case of a 
        State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act, which 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines requires 
        State legislation in order for the respective plan to meet any 
        requirement imposed by the amendments made by subsection (a), 
        the respective plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply 
        with the requirements of such title solely on the basis of its 
        failure to meet such an additional requirement before the first 
        day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of 
        the first regular session of the State legislature that begins

        previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year 
        legislative session, each year of the session shall be 
        considered to be a separate regular session of the State 
        legislature.
