                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants 
    for career support for skilled internationally educated health 
                             professionals.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Professional's Access To Health 
Workforce Integration Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. CAREER SUPPORT FOR SKILLED, INTERNATIONALLY EDUCATED HEALTH 
              PROFESSIONALS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Association of Schools of Public 
        Health, projections indicate a nationwide shortage of up to 
        250,000 public health workers needed by 2020.
            (2) Similar trends are projected for other health 
        professions indicating shortages across disciplines, including 
        within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 2025), dentistry 
        (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy (38,000 by 2030), mental and 
        behavioral health, primary care (46,000 by 2025), and community 
        and allied health.
            (3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will result in 
        serious health threats and more severe and costly health care 
        needs, due to, in part, a delayed response to food-borne 
        outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, 
        fewer cancer screenings, and delayed treatment.
            (4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and health 
        professional shortage areas will be most severely impacted by 
        the health workforce shortage.
            (5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, over 
        2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in the United States 
        today are unemployed or underemployed in low- or semi-skilled 
        jobs that fail to draw on their education and expertise.
            (6) Approximately 2 out of every 5 internationally educated 
        immigrants are unemployed or underemployed.
            (7) According to Drexel University Center for Labor Markets 
        and Policy, underemployment for internationally educated 
        immigrant women is 28 percent higher than for their male 
        counterparts.
            (8) According to the Drexel University Center for labor 
        markets and policy, the mean annual earnings of underemployed 
        immigrants were $32,000, or 43 percent less than United States 
        born college graduates employed in the college labor market.
            (9) According to Upwardly Global and the Welcome Back 
        Initiative, with proper guidance and support, underemployed 
        skilled immigrants typically increase their income by 215 
        percent to 900 percent.
            (10) According to the Brookings Institution and the 
        Partnership for a New American Economy, immigrants working in 
        the health workforce are, on average, better educated than 
        United States-born workers in the health workforce.
