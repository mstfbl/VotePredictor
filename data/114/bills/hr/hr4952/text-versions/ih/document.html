 To impose a deadline by which a person whose Federal firearms license 
has expired, or is surrendered, or revoked, must liquidate the firearms 
    inventory of any business subject to the license, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Federal Firearms Licensing 
Act''.

SEC. 2. DEADLINE FOR LIQUIDATION OF FIREARMS BUSINESS INVENTORY AFTER 
              EXPIRATION, SURRENDER, OR REVOCATION OF FEDERAL FIREARMS 
              LICENSE.

    Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(m)(1)(A) A person whose license issued under this chapter has 
expired, or is surrendered or revoked, shall liquidate the firearms 
inventory of any business subject to the license, by the end of the 
period described in subparagraph (B). During that period, the license 
shall continue to be considered valid.
    ``(B) The period described in this subparagraph is the 60-day 
period beginning with the effective date of the expiration, surrender, 
or revocation, plus such additional period as the Attorney General may 
allow on a showing of reasonable cause.
    ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a person if a 
United States district court for the judicial district in which the 
person resides or in which the principal place of business of the 
person subject to the license is located finds, by clear and convincing 
evidence, that the continued operation by the person of the business 
poses an immediate and grave threat to public safety.''.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF WILLFULLY.

    Section 923(e) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term `willfully' means, 
with respect to conduct of a person, that the person knew of a legal 
duty, and engaged in the conduct knowingly and in intentional disregard 
of the duty. Repetition of a recordkeeping violation, regardless of 
frequency, shall not be considered evidence that the licensee committed 
the violation knowingly and in intentional disregard of a legal 
duty.''.
