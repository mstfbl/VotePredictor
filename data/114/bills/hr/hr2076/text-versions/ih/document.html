SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

    A Federal banking regulator may not--
                    (1) terminate or limit the deposit insurance or 
                share insurance of a depository institution under the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.) 
                or the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1751 et 
                seq.) solely because the depository institution 
                provides or has provided financial services to a 
                marijuana-related legitimate business;
                    (2) prohibit, penalize, or otherwise discourage a 
                depository institution from providing financial 
                services to a marijuana-related legitimate business;
                    (3) recommend, incentivize, or encourage a 
                depository institution not to offer financial services 
                to an individual, or to downgrade or cancel the 
                financial services offered to an individual solely 
                because--
                            (A) the individual is a manufacturer or 
                        producer, or is the owner or operator of a 
                        marijuana-related legitimate business;
                            (B) the individual later becomes an owner 
                        or operator of a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; or
                            (C) the depository institution was not 
                        aware that the individual is the owner or 
                        operator of a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; and
                    (4) take any adverse or corrective supervisory 
                action on a loan made to an owner or operator of--
                            (A) a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business, solely because the owner or operator 
                        owns or operates a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; or
                            (B) real estate or equipment that is leased 
                        to a marijuana-related legitimate business, 
                        solely because the owner or operator of the 
                        real estate or equipment leased the equipment 
                        or real estate to a marijuana-related 
                        legitimate business.
