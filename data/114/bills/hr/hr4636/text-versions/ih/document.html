    (a) In General.--Section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code, is 
amended--

rulemaking under subsection (b) with respect to such rule and ending on 
the date that is 60 days after such date of publication, subject to 
paragraph (3).
    ``(3)(A) With respect to a rule, if a committee of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate that has jurisdiction under the Rules of 
the House of Representatives or the Senate, respectively, over the 
provision of law that authorizes the agency to issue the rule submits 
written data, views, or arguments to the head of the agency through 
electronic mail and physical mail during the period described in 
paragraph (2), not later than 10 days after the date of such 
submission, the head of the agency shall publish in the Federal

submission with respect to a rule to the head of an agency under such 
paragraph by a committee that has made an initial submission to such 
head and received a response under such paragraph if the head--
            ``(A) determines that such subsequent submission--
                    ``(i) fails to address the content of such 
                response; or
                    ``(ii) raises issues that were not raised in the 
                initial submission or the response; and
            ``(B) notifies the committee of such determination.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section shall apply 
with respect to a rule for which the notice of proposed rulemaking is 
published under section 553(b) of title 5, United States Code, on or 
after the date of enactment of this Act.
