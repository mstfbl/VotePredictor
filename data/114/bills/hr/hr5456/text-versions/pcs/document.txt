SEC. 201. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION FOR PLACEMENTS 
              THAT ARE NOT IN FOSTER FAMILY HOMES.

    (a) Limitation on Federal Financial Participation.--
            (1) In general.--Section 472 of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 672), as amended by section 112, is amended--
                    (A) in subsection (a)(2)(C), by inserting ``, but 
                only to the extent permitted under subsection (k)'' 
                after ``institution''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(k) Limitation on Federal Financial Participation.--
            ``(1) In general.--Beginning with the third week for which 
        foster care maintenance payments are made under this section on 
        behalf of a child placed in a child-care institution, no 
        Federal payment shall be made to the State under section 
        474(a)(1) for amounts expended for foster care maintenance 
        payments on behalf of the child unless--
                    ``(A) the child is placed in a child-care 
                institution that is a setting specified in paragraph 
                (2) (or is placed in a licensed residential family-
                based treatment facility consistent with subsection 
                (j)); and

                (4)), the requirements specified in paragraph (3) and 
                section 475A(c) are met.
            ``(2) Specified settings for placement.--The settings for 
        placement specified in this paragraph are the following:
                    ``(A) A qualified residential treatment program (as 
                defined in paragraph (4)).
                    ``(B) A setting specializing in providing prenatal, 
                post-partum, or parenting supports for youth.

                years of age, a supervised setting in which the child 
                is living independently.

        in a qualified residential treatment program.--

                child who is placed in a qualified residential 
                treatment program, if the assessment required under 
                section 475A(c)(1) is not completed within 30 days 
                after the placement is made, no Federal payment shall 
                be made to the State under section 474(a)(1) for any 
                amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments 
                on behalf of the child during the placement.
                    ``(B) Deadline for transition out of placement.--If 
                the assessment required under section 475A(c)(1)

                residential treatment program is not appropriate, a 
                court disapproves such a placement under section 
                475A(c)(2), or a child who has been in an approved 
                placement in a qualified residential treatment program

                willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive 
                parent, or in a foster family home, Federal payments 
                shall be made to the State under section 474(a)(1) for 
                amounts expended for foster care maintenance payments 
                on behalf of the child while the child remains in the 
                qualified residential treatment program only during the 
                period necessary for the child to transition home or to 
                such a placement. In no event shall a State receive 
                Federal payments under section 474(a)(1) for amounts 
                expended for foster care maintenance payments on behalf 
                of a child who remains placed in a qualified 
                residential treatment program after the end of the 30-
                day period that begins on the date a determination is 
                made that the placement is no longer the recommended or 
                approved placement for the child.

        care maintenance payments made on behalf of any child who is 
        placed in a setting that is not a foster family home, the State 
        will not enact or advance policies or practices that would 
        result in a significant increase in the population of youth in 
        the State's juvenile justice system.''.

        United States shall evaluate the impact, if any, on State 
        juvenile justice systems of the limitation imposed under 
        section 472(k) of the Social Security Act (as added by section 
        201(a)(1)) on foster care maintenance payments made on behalf 
        of any child who is placed in a setting that is not a foster 
        family home, in accordance with the amendments made by 
        subsections (a) and (b) of this section. In particular, the 
        Comptroller General shall evaluate the extent to which children 
        in foster care who also are subject to the juvenile justice 
        system of the State are placed in a facility under the 
        jurisdiction of the juvenile justice system and whether the 
        lack of available congregate care placements under the 
        jurisdiction of the child welfare systems is a contributing 
        factor to that result. Not later than December 31, 2023, the 
        Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report on the 
        results of the evaluation.
