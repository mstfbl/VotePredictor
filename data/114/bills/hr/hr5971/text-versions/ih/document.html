                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of this title, a 
                plan or other arrangement shall not fail to be treated 
                as a cafeteria plan or dependent care flexible spending 
                arrangement solely because qualified benefits under 
                such plan include a dependent care flexible spending 
                arrangement under which unused dependent care benefits 
                may be carried forward to the succeeding plan year of

                flexible spending arrangement (as defined in section

                reimbursement for expenses for dependent care 
                assistance.
                    ``(C) Unused health benefits.--For purposes of this

                        allowable to the employee during a plan year 
                        under a dependent care flexible spending 
                        arrangement, taking into account any election 
                        by the employee, over
                            ``(ii) the actual amount of reimbursement 
                        during such year under such arrangement.''.
