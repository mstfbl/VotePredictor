      To amend the Military Selective Service Act to require the 
  reinstatement of the draft whenever an authorization on the use of 
 military force or declaration of war is in effect and to provide for

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    Subsection (c) of section 17 of the Military Selective Service Act 
(50 U.S.C. App. 467) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(c) Reinstatement of Draft.--

        the enactment of a law containing an authorization on the use 
        of military force or a declaration of war, the President shall 
        resume the induction of persons subject to registration under 
        section 3(a) for training and service in the Armed Forces so 
        that service and sacrifice in the Armed Forces during the 
        period of such authorization or declaration is shared broadly 
        among the American people.
            ``(2) Termination authority.--The President may terminate 
        the induction of persons under paragraph (1) upon the

        induction.''.
