_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
 To require the establishment of a national strategy for combating the 
  financing of terrorism and related financial crimes, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategy for Combating 
Terrorist, Underground, and Other Illicit Financing Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The financing of terrorism and related forms of illicit 
        finance present a direct threat to national security and a 
        threat to global stability.
            (2) New terrorist groups or threats can form quickly, and 
        other groups change tactics to adapt, creating a constantly 
        changing terrorist environment, presenting ever-changing risks 
        and challenges to programs to disrupt the financing of 
        terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.
            (3) As demonstrated in hearings before the Task Force to 
        Investigate Terrorism Financing, terrorists in some instances 
        have formed symbiotic relationships with, or are taking over, 
        transnational crime syndicates, so that funding for both 
        terrorism and profits from crime flow in the same fashion and 
        often are indistinguishable.
            (4) Methods of concealing the movement of illicit funding 
        change quickly in a globalized economy, and rapid technological 
        changes and financial innovation pose new risks that may be 
        increasingly difficult for governments to stay abreast of 
        without an agile, constantly adjusted strategy to spot, 
        disrupt, and prevent the financing of terrorism and related 
        forms of illicit finance.
            (5) A bipartisan requirement to create a national anti-
        money laundering strategy enacted in 1998 expired in 2007. 
        Given the rapid globalization and rapid technology changes of 
        the financial sector, an updated strategy focused on the 
        financing of terrorism is necessary.
            (6) It is important for the Government to have a unified 
        strategy to fight financial crime and to update it annually, 
        both to accommodate new and developing threats and to help 
        Congress develop legislative and funding priorities.
            (7) An effective strategy to counter terrorism financing is 
        a critical component of the broader counter terrorism strategy 
        of the United States.

SEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL STRATEGY.

    (a) In General.--The President, acting through the Secretary of the 
Treasury (the ``Secretary'') shall, in consultation with the Attorney 
General, the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Homeland Security, the 
Director of National Intelligence and the appropriate Federal banking 
agencies, develop a national strategy for combating the financing of 
terrorism and related forms of illicit finance.
    (b) Transmittal to Congress.--By June 1 each year following the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a national strategy developed in 
accordance with subsection (a).
    (c) Evaluation of Existing Efforts and Broader Strategy.--The 
President shall accompany each strategy submitted under subsection (b) 
with a report that--
            (1) describes the effectiveness of efforts to enforce 
        existing prohibitions against illicit finance;
            (2) describes how the United States is addressing the 
        highest levels of risk identified in the National Money 
        Laundering Risk Assessment and the National Terrorist Financing 
        Risk Assessment published by the Department of the Treasury;
            (3) evaluates the effectiveness of United States efforts to 
        fight illicit finance at actually preventing, discovering, and 
        countering terrorist financing and other forms of illicit 
        finance (and the effectiveness of those efforts that the United 
        States coordinates with foreign nations); and
            (4) describes how the strategy submitted under subsection 
        (b) is integrated into, and supports, the broader counter 
        terrorism strategy of the United States.
    (d) Separate Presentation of Classified Material.--Any part of the 
national strategy that involves information which is properly 
classified under criteria established by the President shall be 
submitted to the Congress separately in a classified annex and, if 
requested by the chairman or ranking Member of one of the appropriate 
congressional committees, as a briefing at an appropriate level of 
security.
