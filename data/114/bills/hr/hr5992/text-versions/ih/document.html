SEC. 6. PROCEDURE FOR GRANTING IMMIGRANT STATUS.

    (a) Filing Order and Eligibility.--Section 204(a)(1)(H) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)) is amended to 
read as follows:
                    ``(H)(i) An alien desiring to be classified under 
                section 203(b)(5) may file a petition with the 
                Secretary of Homeland Security, but only if the alien 
                is not under 18 years of age at the time of filing. An 
                alien who seeks to pool the alien's investment with one 
                or more additional aliens seeking classification under 
                section 203(b)(5) shall file for classification 
                pursuant to section 203(b)(5)(H). An alien petitioning 
                for classification pursuant to section 203(b)(5)(H) may 
                only file a petition with the Secretary after the 
                regional center has filed an application for approval 
                of an investment under section 203(b)(5)(I).
                    ``(ii) A petitioner shall establish eligibility at 
                the time the alien files for classification under 
                section 203(b)(5) and, if not eligible at the time of 
                filing, shall be denied such classification even if the 
                petitioner later becomes eligible under materially 
                different facts or circumstances. Aliens asserting 
                eligibility under a materially different set of facts 
                that did not exist when the petition was filed shall 
                file a new petition. A petitioner shall continue to be 
                eligible for classification at the time such petition 
                is adjudicated.''.
    (b) Effective Dates.--
            (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsection (a) 
        shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.

                the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                1154(a)(1)(H)), as added by subsection (a), shall apply 
                to any petition for classification pursuant to section 
                203(b)(5)(H) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(H)) that 
                is filed with the Secretary of Homeland Security on or 
                after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                    (B) Eligibility.--Clause (ii) of section 
                204(a)(1)(H) of such Act, as added by subsection (a), 
                shall apply to any petition for classification pursuant 
                to section 203(b)(5)(H) of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5)(E)) filed with the 
                Secretary of Homeland Security at any time.

Director shall set fees for services provided pursuant to section 
203(b)(5) and 216A of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(5) and 1186b), as 
amended by this Act, and for adjudicating petitions filed pursuant to 
section 204(a)(1)(H) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)), as amended 
by this Act, at a level sufficient to ensure the full recovery only of 
the costs of providing such services, including the cost of attaining 
the goal of completing adjudications, on average, not later than--
            (1) 120 days after receiving a proposal for the 
        establishment of a regional center described in section 
        203(b)(5)(H);
            (2) 120 days after receiving an application for approval of

        removal of conditions described in section 216A(c).

            (1) in an amount that is equal to the amount paid by all 
        other classes of fee-paying applicants for immigration-related 
        benefits, to the coverage or reduction of the costs of 
        processing or adjudicating classes of immigration benefit 
        applications that Congress, or the Secretary in the case of 
        asylum applications, has authorized to be processed or 
        adjudicated at no cost or at a reduced cost to the applicant; 
        and
            (2) in an amount that is not greater than 1 percent of the 
        fee for filing a petition pursuant to section 204(a)(1)(H) of 
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1154(a)(1)(H)), 
        to make improvements to the information technology systems used 
        by the Secretary to process, adjudicate, and archive 
        applications and petitions under such section, including the 
        conversion to electronic format of documents filed by 
        petitioners and applicants for benefits under such section.
    (d) Premium Processing of EB-5 Petitions and Applications.--
            (1) Modification of existing premium processing 
        provision.--Section 286(u) of the Immigration and Nationality 
        Act (8 U.S.C. 1356(u)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(u) Premium Fee for Employment-Based Petitions and

        services to business customers and to make infrastructure 
        improvements in the adjudications and customer-service 
        processes. For approval of the benefit applied for, the 
        petitioner or applicant shall meet the legal criteria for such 
        benefit. Except as provided under paragraph (2), the fee under 
        this paragraph shall be set at $1,000, shall be paid in 
        addition to any normal petition or application fee that may be 
        applicable, and shall be deposited as offsetting collections in 
        the Immigration Examinations Fee Account. The Secretary may 
        adjust the fee under this paragraph in proportion to changes in 
        the Consumer Price Index.

        shall be permitted an opportunity to provide additional 
        evidence identified by the Secretary in any such petition or 
        application prior to a final determination. The premium fee for

        \1/2\ of the relevant period set forth in section 6(b) of the 
        American Job Creation and Investment Promotion Reform Act of 
        2016, and shall otherwise only be used to recover the costs of
