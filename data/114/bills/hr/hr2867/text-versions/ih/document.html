SEC. 2. VOTING ON INDIAN LANDS.

    Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Voting on Indian Lands.--
            ``(1) Tribal requests for polling places; polling place 
        provided.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A representative official of an 
                Indian tribe, with authorization from the governing 
                body of the tribe, may request one or more polling 
                places to be located on the Indian lands of the Indian 
                tribe. Such request shall be delivered in writing to 
                the State or political subdivision with responsibility 
                for assigning polling places at least 6 months prior to 
                the next election for which the request is made, and 
                shall specify the location of each requested polling 
                place.
                    ``(B) Polling places provided.--Each requested 
                polling place shall be provided by the State or 
                political subdivision in response to a request made 
                under paragraph (1), at no expense to the Indian tribe, 
                if the voting-age population within the geographic area 
                of the Indian lands relevant to the requested polling 
                place is at least equal to the smallest voting-age 
                population served by any other polling place in the 
                State. Each polling place that is provided under this 
                subparagraph shall continue to be provided after the 
                election for which the request was made, until such 
                time as the Indian tribe that requested that polling 
                place delivers a written request to the State or 
                political subdivision asking that such polling place be 
                withdrawn.
                    ``(C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to prevent a State or 
                political subdivision from providing additional polling 
                places on Indian lands if no request was made under 
                subparagraph (A), or if such request was made less than 
                6 months prior to the next election for which the 
                request was made.
            ``(2) Requirement to provide equitable polling locations.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A State or political subdivision 
                shall provide the same ratio of poll workers and voting 
                devices, the same rate of pay to poll workers, and the 
                same days and hours of operation, for polling places 
                that are located on Indian lands as are provided in 
                other locations of polling places in the State or 
                political subdivision.
                    ``(B) Eligibility to vote at a polling location.--A 
                polling place located on Indian lands shall be open to 
                voting by all persons who are otherwise eligible to 
                vote residing within the precinct, voting unit, or 
                electoral district.
                    ``(C) Federal facilities.--Polling places located 
                on Indian lands may be designated at--
                            ``(i) a Federal facility, such as Indian 
                        Health Service or Bureau of Indian Affairs 
                        service buildings;
                            ``(ii) any tribal government facility that 
                        meets the requirements of Federal and State law 
                        applied to other polling locations within the 
                        State;
                            ``(iii) a tribally owned building; or
                            ``(iv) another facility that meets the 
                        requirements for polling places in the State.
            ``(3) Absentee ballots and early voting.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A representative official of an 
                Indian tribe, with authorization from the governing 
                body of the Indian tribe, may deliver a request to the 
                appropriate State or political subdivision that a 
                location on Indian lands be designated as an absentee 
                ballot location or an early voting location, and such 
                State or political subdivision shall grant the request, 
                at no expense to the Indian tribe, if--
                            ``(i) the requested location on Indian 
                        lands is in a State that permits voting by an 
                        absentee or mail-in ballot or early voting 
                        (also called absentee in-person voting), as the 
                        case may be; and
                            ``(ii) the voting-age population within the 
                        geographic area of Indian lands relevant to the 
                        requested absentee ballot location or early 
                        voting location is at least equal to the 
                        smallest voting-age population served by any 
                        other absentee ballot location or early voting 
                        location in the State.
                    ``(B) Indian lands as absentee ballot location.--If 
                a location on Indian lands is designated as an absentee 
                ballot location or an early voting location, absentee 
                ballots, or early ballots, as the case may be, shall be 
                provided, at no expense to the Indian tribe, to each 
                registered voter living in such designated location 
                without the requirement of an excuse for an absentee 
                ballot or early voting. Bilingual election materials 
                and oral language assistance shall be provided if 
                required by section 203.
            ``(4) Tribal requests for voter registration agencies.--A 
        representative official of an Indian tribe, with authorization 
        from the governing body of the tribe, may request that tribal 
        government service offices be designated as voter registration 
        agencies under section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act 
        of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20506). Such a request shall be delivered in 
        writing to the State or political subdivision with 
        responsibility for assigning polling locations at least 6 
        months prior to the next election for which the request is 
        made. Such a request shall be granted if the tribal government 
        service office meets the requirements of Federal and State law 
        applied to other designated voter registration agencies within 
        the State.''.

                declaratory judgment under section 3(c) or section 5,

        the 60-day period following receipt of a submission, the 
        Attorney General may reserve the right to reexamine the 
        submission if additional information comes to the Attorney 
        General's attention during the remainder of the 60-day period

        section. Any action under this section shall be heard and 
        determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the 
        provisions of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code, and 
        any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court.

section. Such actions shall be heard and determined by a court of 3 
judges under section 2284 of title 28, United States Code. In any such 
action, the court shall provide as a remedy that any voting 
qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or 
procedure with respect to voting, that is the subject of the action 
under this subsection be enjoined unless the court determines that--
            ``(1) the voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, 
        or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting, is 
        not a covered practice described in subsection (b); or

purposes of this section, the calculation of the population of a racial 
group or a language minority group shall be carried out using the 
methodology in the guidance promulgated in the Federal Register on 
February 9, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 7470).

section, any data provided by the Bureau of the Census, whether based 
on estimation from sample or actual enumeration, shall not be subject 
to challenge or review in any court.
