                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 28, 2015

Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas (for herself and Mr. Sensenbrenner) 
 introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on 
                     Science, Space, and Technology

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To provide for a coordinated Federal research program to ensure 
       continued United States leadership in engineering biology.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Engineering Biology Research and 
Development Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cellular and molecular processes may be used, mimicked, 
        or redesigned to develop new products, processes, and systems 
        that improve societal well-being, strengthen national security, 
        and contribute to the economy.
            (2) Engineering biology relies on scientists and engineers 
        with a diverse and unique set of skills combining the 
        biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering.
            (3) Long-term research and development is necessary to 
        create breakthroughs in engineering biology. Such research and 
        development requires government investment as the benefits are 
        too distant or uncertain for industry to support alone.
            (4) The Federal Government can play an important role by 
        facilitating the development of tools and technologies to 
        further advance engineering biology, including multiple user 
        facilities that the Federal Government is uniquely able to 
        support.
            (5) Since other countries are investing significant 
        resources in engineering biology, the United States is at risk 
        of losing its competitive lead in this emerging area if it does 
        not invest the necessary resources and have a national 
        strategy.
            (6) A National Engineering Biology Initiative can serve to 
        establish new research directions and technology goals, improve 
        interagency coordination and planning processes, drive 
        technology transfer, and help ensure optimal returns on the 
        Federal investment.
