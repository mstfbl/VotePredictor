_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To enhance electronic warfare capabilities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Warfare Capabilities 
Enhancement Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FIELDING OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM WARFARE SYSTEMS AND 
              ELECTRONIC WARFARE CAPABILITIES.

    Funds authorized to be appropriated for electromagnetic spectrum 
warfare systems and electronic warfare systems may be used for the 
development and fielding of such systems. Funds authorized to be 
appropriated for sustainment of electromagnetic spectrum warfare 
systems and electronic warfare systems may be used for the 
modernization of such systems after the date on which the Secretary 
notifies the congressional defense committees of such use.

SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF ELECTRONIC WARFARE PROGRAMS IN THE RAPID 
              ACQUISITION AUTHORITY PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Section 806(c)(1) of the Bob Stump National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314; 10 
U.S.C. 2302 note) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
            ``(D)(i) In the case of any supplies and associated support 
        services that, as determined in writing by the Secretary of 
        Defense, are urgently needed to eliminate a deficiency in 
        electronic warfare capabilities that if left unfilled is likely 
        to result in critical mission failure, the loss of life, 
        property destruction, or economic effects, the Secretary may 
        use the procedures developed under this section in order to 
        accomplish the rapid acquisition and deployment of needed 
        offensive or defensive electronic warfare capabilities, 
        supplies, and associated support services.
            ``(ii) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure, to the extent 
        practicable, that for the purposes of electronic warfare 
        acquisition, the Department of Defense shall consider use of 
        the following procedures:
                    ``(I) The rapid acquisition authority provided 
                under this section.
                    ``(II) Use of other transactions authority provided 
                under section 2371 of title 10, United States Code.
                    ``(III) The acquisition of commercial items using 
                simplified acquisition procedures.
                    ``(IV) The authority for procurement for

                title 10, United States Code.
            ``(iii) The Secretary may only delegate the authority to 
        make the determination under clause (i) to the Under Secretary 
        of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
            ``(iv) In this subparagraph, the term `electronic warfare' 
        means military action involving the use of electromagnetic and 
        directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or to 
        attack the enemy.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 2373 of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and aeronautical 
        supplies'' and inserting ``, aeronautical supplies, 
        electromagnetic spectrum warfare, and electronic warfare''; and
            (2) by adding at the end of the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) The term `electromagnetic spectrum warfare' means 
        electronic warfare that encompasses military communications and 
        sensing operations that occur in the electromagnetic 
        operational domain.
            ``(2) The term `electronic warfare' means military action 
        involving the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to 
        control the electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy.''.

appeal to the Office of the Secretary of Defense to review any program 
through the normal Joint Capabilities Integration and Development 
System process.

SEC. 5. ELECTRONIC WARFARE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE REPORTS TO CONGRESS.

    Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Electronic Warfare Executive Committee shall submit to the
