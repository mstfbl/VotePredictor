    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall maintain a Home 
Energy Score Program to provide to homeowners and borrowers, on a 
voluntary basis at the request of the homeowner or borrower, a score 
document for the purpose of enabling the cost-effective reduction in 
the energy use of those homes. Score documents shall be available under 
the Program for both new and existing homes. A score document shall 
grade the home on its energy consumption for heating, cooling, water 
heating, and other variables the Secretary considers appropriate to 
enable achieving cost-effective reduction in the energy use of the 
home, so that it may be easily compared to other homes. The Program may 
include the alternate use of any comparable residential rating system, 
as approved by the Secretary of Energy through published guidelines.
    (b) Assessments.--The Program shall provide for home assessments, 
conducted pursuant to a request by a homeowner or borrower in 
accordance with section 2(a), by assessors who hold a relevant 
qualifying credential approved by the Secretary of Energy, to collect 
energy use information during an approved walk-through of the home for 
the purpose of creating a score document for the home.
    (c) Score Document.--A score document under the Program shall 
include--
            (1) energy use information collected during an assessment 
        described in subsection (b) for a home, differentiated by 
        specific energy uses and provided on a relative scale based on 
        benchmarks set within the Program; and
            (2) cost-effective recommendations of means to improve the 
        score and energy efficiency of the home.
