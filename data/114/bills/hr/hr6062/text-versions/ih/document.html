Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of service-connection a 
diagnosis of such mental health condition by a mental health 
professional together with satisfactory lay or other evidence of such 
trauma and an opinion by the mental health professional that such 
covered mental health condition is related to such military sexual 
trauma, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships 
of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official 
record of such incurrence or aggravation in such service, and, to that 
end, shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. 
Service-connection of such covered mental health condition may be 
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The reasons 
for granting or denying service-connection in each case shall be 
recorded in full.
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, in the absence of clear and 
convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed 
military sexual trauma is consistent with the circumstances, 
conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay 
testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed military 
sexual trauma.
    ``(3) In this subsection:
            ``(A) The term `covered mental health condition' means 
        post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, or other 
        mental health diagnosis described in the current version of the 
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published 
        by the American Psychiatric Association that the Secretary 
        determines to be related to military sexual trauma.
            ``(B) The term `military sexual trauma' means, with respect 
        to a veteran, psychological trauma, which in the judgment of a 
        mental health professional, resulted from a physical assault of 
        a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual 
        harassment which occurred during active military, naval, or air 
        service.''.

             Subtitle F--Opioid Therapy and Pain Management

SEC. 261. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many veterans and their families have been affected by 
        the national opioid epidemic caused in part by the prescription 
        of opioid medication to manage pain.
            (2) Prescription opioid overdose rates for veterans 
        receiving medical care furnished by the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs are twice the national average.
            (3) More than 50 percent of veterans receiving such care 
        are suffering from chronic pain.
            (4) Almost one in three veterans receiving such care are 
        prescribed opioids to manage pain.
            (5) Many veterans prescribed opioids for the management of 
        chronic pain are at risk of developing a dependency on opioids.
            (6) Many veterans receive health care from both the 
        Department and community providers but the lack of care 
        coordination among the Department and community providers when 
        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for 
        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite 
        health care resources.
            (7) Veteran-centric care coordination is associated with 
        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department 
        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the 
        best care for veterans.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) veterans suffering from opioid dependency should 
        receive timely access to treatment and social services at 
        Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or through qualified 
        community providers and should have care and services managed 
        and coordinated by the Department of Veterans Affairs;
            (2) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs to receive opioid addiction treatment in the 
        community must not lose the high-quality, safety, care 
        coordination, and other veteran-centric elements that the 
        health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        provides; and
            (3) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from a 
        community provider, such care must be secured in a cost-
        effective manner, in a way that complements the larger health 
        care system of the Department by using industry standards for 
        care and costs.

SEC. 262. PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS SUFFERING 
              FROM OPIOID ADDICTION AND CHRONIC PAIN.

    (a) In General.--Beginning not later than 120 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
conduct a pilot program under which the Secretary provides health and 
social services and coordination of care and case management to covered 
veterans in need of treatment for opioid addiction and chronic pain 
through facilities of the Department and through qualified non-
Department health care providers.
    (b) Program Locations.--
            (1) In general.--The pilot program shall be carried out

                Department facilities selected shall be located in 
                States that demonstrate--
                            (i) the need for additional resources to 
                        provide health care services, including mental 
                        health, chronic pain management and social 
                        services to veterans in need of treatment for 
                        opioid abuse based upon the community 
                        assessment in subsection (a) of this section;
                            (ii) demographic, population, and census 
                        data showing the highest rates per capita of 
                        opioid addiction in the United States or 
                        greater demand in the veteran patient 
                        population than capacity in facilities of the 
                        Department for treatment for opioid addiction; 
                        and
                            (iii) lack of sufficient Department 
                        capacity to meet the demand of all patients in 
                        need of treatment for opioid addiction.
                    (B) Other requirements.--In addition to the 
                requirements in subparagraph (A), not fewer than four 
                of the five selected States shall include--
                            (i) at least one highly rural county, as 
                        determined by the Secretary upon consideration 
                        of the most recent decennial census with the 
                        highest per capita rate of opioid addiction;
                            (ii) an urban county as determined by the 
                        Secretary upon consideration of the most recent 
                        decennial census with the largest population 
                        per capita of opioid addiction;
                            (iii) a county as determined by the 
                        Secretary in a State with one of the highest 
                        statistically significant drug and opioid 
                        overdose death rate increases from 2013 to 2014 
                        according to the Centers for Disease Control 
                        and Prevention and a low expenditure of funding 
                        per capita on substance abuse treatment in 
                        comparison to other States; and
                            (iv) a county as determined by the 
                        Secretary in a State with a high rate per 
                        capita of veterans diagnosed with chronic pain 
                        and prescribed prescription opioids.
    (c) Provision of Services Through Contract.--The Secretary may

                public, and any benefit of those services to the 
                general public is ancillary to the intended benefit to 
                veterans and their families; and
            (2) excludes services in which the only benefit to veterans 
        and their families is the generation of revenue for the

        eligible for the program established under subsection

eligible for naturalization through service in the Armed Forces of the 
United States under sections 328 and 329 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1439; 1440), except that--

        ordered removed, or removed, from the United States, or was 
        rendered inadmissible to, or deportable from, the United 
        States, shall be disregarded when determining whether the 
        noncitizen is a person of good moral character; and
            (2) any period of absence from the United States due to the 
        noncitizen having been removed, or being inadmissible, shall be 
        disregarded when determining if the noncitizen satisfies any 
        requirement relating to continuous residence or physical 
        presence.

        case under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall annotate all 
        immigration and naturalization records of the Department of 
        Homeland Security relating to the noncitizen involved so as to 
        reflect that identification and afford an opportunity to track

SEC. 803. REVIEW OF DISCHARGE CHARACTERIZATION.

    (a) In General.--In accordance with this section, the appropriate 
discharge boards--
            (1) shall review the discharge characterization of covered 
        members at the request of the covered member; and
            (2) if such characterization is any characterization except 
        honorable, may change such characterization to honorable.
    (b) Criteria.--In changing the discharge characterization of a 
covered member to honorable under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of 
Defense shall ensure that such changes are carried out consistently and 
uniformly across the military departments using the following criteria:
            (1) The original discharge must be based on Don't Ask Don't 
        Tell (in this Act referred to as ``DADT'') or a similar policy 
        in place prior to the enactment of DADT.
            (2) Such discharge characterization shall be so changed if, 
        with respect to the original discharge, there were no 
        aggravating circumstances, such as misconduct, that would have 
        independently led to a discharge characterization that was any 
        characterization except honorable. For purposes of this 
        paragraph, such aggravating circumstances may not include--
                    (A) an offense under section 925 of title 10, 
                United States Code (article 125 of the Uniform Code of 
                Military Justice), committed by a covered member 
                against a person of the same sex with the consent of 
                such person; or
                    (B) statements, consensual sexual conduct, or 
                consensual acts relating to sexual orientation or 
                identity, or the disclosure of such statements, 
                conduct, or acts, that were prohibited at the time of 
                discharge but after the date of such discharge became 
                permitted.
            (3) When requesting a review, a covered member, or their 
        representative, shall be required to provide either--
                    (A) documents consisting of--
                            (i) a copy of the DD-214 form of the 
                        member;
                            (ii) a personal affidavit of the 
                        circumstances surrounding the discharge; and
                            (iii) any relevant records pertaining to 
                        the discharge; or
                    (B) an affidavit certifying that the member, or 
                their representative, does not have the documents 
                specified in subparagraph (A).
            (4) If a covered member provides an affidavit described in 
        subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3)--
                    (A) the appropriate discharge board shall make 
                every effort to locate the documents specified in 
                subparagraph (A) of such paragraph within the records 
                of the Department of Defense; and
                    (B) the absence of such documents may not be 
                considered a reason to deny a change of the discharge 
                characterization under subsection (a)(2).
    (c) Request for Review.--The appropriate discharge board shall 
ensure the mechanism by which covered members, or their representative, 
may request to have the discharge characterization of the covered 
member reviewed under this section is simple and straightforward.
    (d) Review.--
            (1) In general.--After a request has been made under 
        subsection (c), the appropriate discharge board shall review 
        all relevant laws, records of oral testimony previously taken, 
        service records, or any other relevant information regarding 
        the discharge characterization of the covered member.
            (2) Additional materials.--If additional materials are 
        necessary for the review, the appropriate discharge board--
                    (A) may request additional information from the 
                covered member or their representative, in writing, and 
                specifically detailing what is being requested; and
                    (B) shall be responsible for obtaining a copy of 
                the necessary files of the covered member from the 
                member, or when applicable, from the Department of 
                Defense.
    (e) Change of Characterization.--The appropriate discharge board 
shall change the discharge characterization of a covered member to 
honorable if such change is determined to be appropriate after a review 
is conducted under subsection (d) pursuant to the criteria under 
subsection (b). A covered member, or the representative of the member, 
may appeal a decision by the appropriate discharge board to not change 
the discharge characterization by using the regular appeals process of 
the board.
    (f) Change of Records.--For each covered member whose discharge 
characterization is changed under subsection (e), or for each covered 
member who was honorably discharged but whose DD-214 form reflects the 
sexual orientation of the member, the Secretary of Defense shall 
reissue to the member or their representative a revised DD-214 form 
that reflects the following:
            (1) For each covered member discharged, the Separation 
        Code, Reentry Code, Narrative Code, and Separation Authority 
        shall not reflect the sexual orientation of the member and 
        shall be placed under secretarial authority. Any other similar 
        indication of the sexual orientation or reason for discharge 
        shall be removed or changed accordingly to be consistent with
