to be disclosed under subsection (a) is not readily accessible to a 
party after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, as required 
by Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that information 
may instead be generally described, along with an explanation of why 
such undisclosed information was not readily accessible, and of any 
efforts made by such party to access such information.
    ``(c) Amendment of Pleadings.--Nothing in this section shall be

    ``(a) Award.--The court shall award, to a prevailing party, 
reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection 
with a civil action in which any party asserts a claim for relief 
arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, unless the court 
finds that the position and conduct of the nonprevailing party or 
parties were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special 
circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor) 
make an award unjust.
    ``(b) Certification and Recovery.--Upon motion of any party to the 
action, the court shall require another party to the action to certify 
whether or not the other party will be able to pay an award of fees and 
other expenses if such an award is made under subsection (a). If a 
nonprevailing party is unable to pay an award that is made against it 
under subsection (a), the court may make a party that has been joined 
under section 299(d) with respect to such party liable for the 
unsatisfied portion of the award.
    ``(c) Covenant Not to Sue.--A party to a civil action who asserts a 
claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents 
against another party, and who subsequently unilaterally (i) seeks 
dismissal of the action without consent of the other party and (ii) 
extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement with 
respect to the patent or patents at issue, may be the subject of a 
motion for attorneys fees under subsection (a) as if it were a non-
prevailing party, unless the party asserting such claim would have been 
entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to dismiss 
voluntarily the action without a court order under Rule 41 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the interests of justice require 
otherwise.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment and amendment.--

        effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply

        relating to patents in which fees and other expenses have been 
        awarded under section 285 to a prevailing party defending 
        against an allegation of infringement of a patent claim, and in 
        which the nonprevailing party alleging infringement is unable 
        to pay the award of fees and other expenses, the court shall 
        grant a motion by the prevailing party to join an interested 
        party if such prevailing party shows that the nonprevailing 
        party has no substantial interest in the subject matter at 
        issue other than asserting such patent claim in litigation.
            ``(2) Limitation on joinder.--
                    ``(A) Discretionary denial of motion.--The court 
                may deny a motion to join an interested party under

                of the subject matter.''.
    (d) Discovery Stay.--
            (1) Amendment.--Chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, 
        as amended by subsection (a), is further amended by inserting 
        after section 281A (as added by such subsection) the following 
        new section:
``Sec. 281B. Stay of discovery pending a preliminary motion.
    ``(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (d), in an 
action for patent infringement under section 271 or an action for a 
declaratory judgement that a patent is invalid or not infringed,

                1406(a) of title 28; or

                of Civil Procedure 12(b); and
            ``(2) such motion is filed within 90 days after service of 
        the complaint and includes a declaration or other evidence in 
        support of the motion.
    ``(b) Expiration of Stay.--A stay entered under subsection (a) 
shall expire when all motions that are the basis for the stay are 
decided by the court.
    ``(c) Priority of Decision.--In an action described in subsection

Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) before the earlier of the date on which 
the court--
            ``(1) decides any other substantive motion, provided 
        however that the court may decide a question of its own 
        jurisdiction at any time; or
            ``(2) issues a scheduling order under Rule 16(b) of the 
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    ``(d) Exception.--
            ``(1) Discovery necessary to decide motion.--
        Notwithstanding subsection (a), the court may allow such

        allegedly infringing product or process that competes with a 
        product or process made, sold, or offered for sale by the 
        patentee.
            ``(3) Consent of the parties.--The patentee and an opposing

            (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections for 
        chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by 
        inserting after the item relating to section 281A, as added by 
        subsection (a), the following new item:

``281B. Stay of discovery pending a preliminary motion.''.
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it is an 
abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to 
send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent 
infringement. Demand letters sent should, at the least, include basic 
information about the patent in question, what is being infringed, and 
how it is being infringed. Any actions or litigation that stem from 
these types of purposely evasive demand letters to end users should be 
considered a fraudulent or deceptive practice and an exceptional 
circumstance when considering whether the litigation is abusive.
    (f) Demand Letters.--Section 284 of title 35, United States Code, 
is amended--
            (1) in the first undesignated paragraph, by striking ``Upon 
        finding'' and inserting ``(a) In General.--Upon finding'';
            (2) in the second undesignated paragraph, by striking 
        ``When the damages'' and inserting ``(b) Assessment by Court; 
        Treble Damages.--When the damages'';
            (3) by inserting after subsection (b), as designated by 
        paragraph (2) of this subsection, the following:
    ``(c) Willful Infringement.--A claimant seeking to establish 
willful infringement may not rely on evidence of pre-suit notification 
of infringement unless that notification identifies with particularity 
the asserted patent, identifies the product or process accused, 
identifies the ultimate parent entity of the claimant, and explains 
with particularity, to the extent possible following a reasonable 
investigation or inquiry, how the product or process infringes one or 
more claims of the patent.''; and
            (4) in the last undesignated paragraph, by striking ``The 
        court'' and inserting ``(d) Expert Testimony.--The court''.
    (g) Venue.--
            (1) Amendment.--Subsection (b) of section 1400 of title 28, 
        United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Venue for Action Relating to Patents.--Notwithstanding 
subsections (b) and (c) of section 1391 of this title, any civil action 
for patent infringement or any action for a declaratory judgment that a 
patent is invalid or not infringed may be brought only in a judicial 
district--
            ``(1) where the defendant has its principal place of 
        business or is incorporated;
            ``(2) where the defendant has committed an act of 
        infringement of a patent in suit and has a regular and 
        established physical facility that gives rise to the act of 
        infringement;
            ``(3) where the defendant has agreed or consented to be 
        sued in the instant action;
            ``(4) where an inventor named on the patent in suit 
        conducted research or development that led to the application 
        for the patent in suit;
            ``(5) where a party has a regular and established physical 
        facility that such party controls and operates, not primarily 
        for the purpose of creating venue, and has--
                    ``(A) engaged in management of significant research 
                and development of an invention claimed in a patent in 
                suit prior to the effective filing date of the patent;
                    ``(B) manufactured a tangible product that is 
                alleged to embody an invention claimed in a patent in 
                suit; or

                tangible good in which the process is alleged to embody 
                an invention claimed in a patent in suit; or
            ``(6) for foreign defendants that do not meet the 
        requirements of paragraphs (1) or (2), according to section 
        1391(d) of this title.''.
            (2) Mandamus relief.--For the purpose of determining 
        whether relief may issue under section 1651 of title 28, United 
        States Code, a clearly and indisputably erroneous denial of a 
        motion under section 1406(a) of such title to dismiss or 
        transfer a case on the basis of section 1400(b) of such title 
        shall be deemed to cause irremediable interim harm.
            (3) Retailers not eligible for customer stay.--If a 
        defendant does not meet the definition of a retailer under 
        section 296(a)(6) of title 35, United States Code, as added by 
        section 5, solely because the defendant manufacturers or causes 
        the manufacture of the covered product or process in suit, the 
        retail facilities of such defendant shall not constitute a 
        regular and established physical facility for purposes of 
        section 1400(b)(2) of title 28, United Code, as added by 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Teleworkers.--The dwelling or residence of an employee 
        or contractor of a defendant who works at such dwelling or 
        residence shall not constitute a regular and established 
        physical facility of the defendant for purposes of section 
        1400(b)(2) of title 28, United Code, as added by paragraph (1).
    (h) Effective Date.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
the amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of 
the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any action for which a 
complaint is filed on or after that date.

SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY OF PATENT OWNERSHIP.

    (a) Amendments.--Section 290 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in the heading, by striking ``suits'' and inserting 
        ``suits; disclosure of interests'';
            (2) by striking ``The clerks'' and inserting ``(a) Notice 
        of Patent Suits.--The clerks''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(b) Initial Disclosure.--

        manufacturer of a covered product or covered process, or a 
        relevant part thereof.
    ``(b) Stay of Action Against Customer.--Except as provided in 
subsection (d), in any civil action in which a party asserts a claim 
for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, the 
court shall grant a motion to stay at least the portion of the action 
against a covered customer related to infringement of a patent 
involving a covered product or covered process if the following 
requirements are met:
            ``(1) Party to the action.--The covered manufacturer is a 
        party to the action or to a separate action (in which a party 
        asserts a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress 
        relating to patents) involving the same patent or patents 
        related to the same covered product or covered process.
            ``(2) Agreement to be bound by issues determined.--The 
        covered customer agrees to be bound as to issues determined in 
        an action described in paragraph (1) without a full and fair 
        opportunity to separately litigate any such issue, but only as 
        to those issues for which all other elements of the common law 
        doctrine of issue preclusion are met.
            ``(3) Deadline to file motion.--The motion is filed after 
        the first pleading in the action but not later than the later 
        of--
                    ``(A) the 120th day after the date on which the 
                first pleading or paper in the action is served that 
                specifically identifies the covered product or covered 
                process as a basis for the covered customer's alleged 
                infringement of the patent and that specifically 
                identifies how the covered product or covered process 
                is alleged to infringe the patent; or
                    ``(B) the date on which the first scheduling order 
                in the case is entered.
            ``(4) Manufacturer consent in certain cases.--In a case in 
        which the covered manufacturer has been made a party to the 
        action on motion by the covered customer, the covered 
        manufacturer and the covered customer consent in writing to the 
        stay.
    ``(c) Lift of Stay.--
            ``(1) In general.--A stay entered under this section may be 
        lifted upon grant of a motion based on a showing that--
                    ``(A) the action involving the covered manufacturer 
                will not resolve a major issue in the suit against the 
                covered customer (such as a covered product or covered 
                process identified in the motion to lift the stay is 
                not a material part of the claimed invention or 
                inventions in the patent or patents in dispute); or
                    ``(B) the stay unreasonably prejudices or would be 
                manifestly unjust to the party seeking to lift the 
                stay.
            ``(2) Separate manufacturer action involved.--In the case 
        of a stay entered under this section based on the participation 
        of the covered manufacturer in a separate action described in 
        subsection (b)(1), a motion under paragraph (1) may only be 
        granted if the court in such separate action determines that 
        the showing required under paragraph (1) has been made.
    ``(d) Exemption.--This section shall not apply to an action that 
includes a cause of action described under section 271(e)(2).
    ``(e) Waiver of Estoppel Effect.--The court may, upon motion, 
determine that a consent judgment or an unappealed final order shall 
not be binding on the covered customer with respect to one or more of 
the issues that gave rise to the stay based on a showing that such 
consent judgment or unappealed final order would unreasonably prejudice 
or be manifestly unjust to the covered customer in light of the 
circumstances of the case if, following the grant of a motion to stay 
under this section, the covered manufacturer described in subsection 
(b)(1)--
            ``(1) obtains or consents to entry of a consent judgment 
        relating to such issue that gave rise to the stay; or
            ``(2) fails to prosecute to a final, non-appealable 
        judgment such issue that gave rise to the stay.
    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to limit the ability of a court to grant any stay, expand any 
stay granted under this section, or grant any motion to intervene, if 
otherwise permitted by law.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 29 of 
title 35, United States Code, is amended by striking the item relating 
to section 296 and inserting the following:

        ``296. Stay of action against customer.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any 
action for which a complaint is filed on or after the first day of the 
30-day period that ends on that date.

SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
              JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.

    (a) Pilot Program for Rules and Procedures on Discovery Burdens and 
Costs and Case Management.--
            (1) Definitions.--In this subsection, the term ``electronic 
        communication'' means any form of electronic communication, 
        including email, text message, and instant message.
            (2) Development of rules and procedures.--Not later than 3 
        months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Director of the Administrative Office of the United States 
        Courts shall designate not fewer than 6 of the district courts 
        of the United States that are participating in the patent cases 
        pilot program established under section 1 of Public Law 111-349 
        (28 U.S.C.137 note) to develop rules and procedures to 
        implement the proposals described in paragraphs (3) through (5) 
        to address the asymmetries in discovery burdens and costs, and 
        to establish case management procedures, in any civil action 
        arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.
            (3) Types of discovery rules and procedures to be 
        considered.--The discovery rules and procedures required under 
        paragraph (2) shall address each of the following:
                    (A) Discovery of core documentary evidence.--
                Whether and to what extent each party to the action is 
                entitled to receive core documentary evidence and 
                should be responsible for the costs of producing core 
                documentary evidence within the possession or control 
                of each such party, and whether and to what extent each 
                party may seek non-core documentary discovery as 
                otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure.
                    (B) Electronic communication.--If the parties 
                request discovery of electronic communication, how such 
                discovery should be phased to occur relative to the 
                exchange of initial disclosures and core documentary 
                evidence, and appropriate limitations to apply to such 
                discovery.
                    (C) Scope of documentary evidence.--The kinds of 
                evidence that should constitute ``core documentary 
                evidence''.
            (4) Specific discovery rules and procedures to be 
        considered for additional document discovery.--The discovery 
        rules and procedures required under paragraph (2) shall address 
        whether the following provisions, or variations on the 
        following provisions, should apply:
                    (A) In general.--Whether each party to the action 
                may seek any additional document discovery otherwise 
                permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
                beyond core documentary evidence, if such party bears 
                the reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's 
                fees, of the additional document discovery.
                    (B) Requirements for additional document 
                discovery.--Whether, unless the parties mutually agree 
                otherwise, no party may be permitted additional 
                document discovery unless such a party posts a bond, or 
                provides other security, in an amount sufficient to 
                cover the expected costs of such additional document 
                discovery, or makes a showing to the court that such 
                party has the financial capacity to pay the costs of 
                such additional document discovery.
                    (C) Good cause modification.--Whether a court, upon 
                motion and for good cause shown, may modify the 
                requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and any 
                definition of core documentary evidence.
                    (D) Computer code.--Whether a court, upon motion 
                and for good cause shown, may determine that computer 
                code should be included in the discovery of core 
                documentary evidence, and whether the discovery of 
                computer code shall occur after the parties have 
                exchanged initial disclosures and other core 
                documentary evidence.
                    (E) Discovery sequence and scope.--Whether the 
                parties shall discuss and address in the written report 
                filed pursuant to rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of 
                Civil Procedure the views and proposals of each party 
                on the following:
                            (i) When the discovery of core documentary 
                        evidence should be completed.
                            (ii) Whether additional document discovery 
                        described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) will be 
                        sought.
                            (iii) Any issues about infringement, 
                        invalidity, or damages that, if resolved before 
                        the additional document discovery described in 
                        subparagraphs (A) and (B) commences, might 
                        simplify or streamline the case.
            (5) Case management rules and procedures to be 
        considered.--The rules and procedures required under paragraph 
        (2) shall also address case management procedures for any civil 
        action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, 
        including initial disclosure and early case management 
        conference practices that--
                    (A) will identify any potential dispositive issues 
                of the case; and
                    (B) focus on early summary judgment motions when 
                resolution of issues may lead to expedited disposition 
                of the case.
    (b) Implementation of Rules and Procedures.--Within 18 months after 
the designation by the Director of the Administrative Office of the 6 
district courts to develop the rules and procedures pursuant to 
subsection (a), the 6 district courts shall complete the development of 
the rules and procedures, and begin to implement them.
    (c) Expansion of Pilot Program for Rules and Procedures on 
Discovery Burdens and Costs and Case Management.--After the rules and 
procedures developed by the pilot program pursuant to subsection (a) 
have been in effect for at least 2 years, the Judicial Conference of 
the United States, using existing resources, may expand the application 
of some or all of those rules and procedures to be implemented by all 
the district courts, and the United States Court of Federal Claims, for 
any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.
    (d) Revision of Form for Patent Infringement.--
            (1) Elimination of form.--The Supreme Court, using existing 
        resources, shall eliminate Form 18 in the Appendix to the 
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (relating to Complaint for 
        Patent Infringement), effective on the date of the enactment of 
        this Act.
            (2) Revised form.--The Supreme Court may prescribe a new 
        form or forms setting out model allegations of patent 
        infringement that, at a minimum, notify accused infringers of 
        the asserted claim or claims, the products or services accused 
        of infringement, and the plaintiff's theory for how each 
        accused product or service meets each limitation of each 
        asserted claim. The Judicial Conference should exercise the 
        authority under section 2073 of title 28, United States Code, 
        to make recommendations with respect to such new form or forms.
    (e) Protection of Intellectual-Property Licenses in Bankruptcy.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1522 of title 11, United States 
        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Section 365(n) shall apply to cases under this chapter. If 
the foreign representative rejects or repudiates a contract under which 
the debtor is a licensor of intellectual property, the licensee under 
such contract shall be entitled to make the election and exercise the 
rights described in section 365(n).''.
            (2) Trademarks.--
                    (A) In general.--Section 101(35A) of title 11, 
                United States Code, is amended--

                        ``title 17;'' and inserting ``title 17; or''; 
                        and
                            (iii) by adding after subparagraph (F) the 
                        following new subparagraph:
                    ``(G) a trademark, service mark, or trade name, as 
                those terms are defined in section 45 of the Act of 
                July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the `Trademark 
                Act of 1946') (15 U.S.C. 1127);''.
                    (B) Conforming amendment.--Section 365(n)(2) of 
                title 11, United States Code, is amended--

                                    (I) by striking ``royalty 
                                payments'' and inserting ``royalty or 
                                other payments''; and
                                    (II) by striking ``and'' after the 
                                semicolon;
                            (ii) in subparagraph (C), by striking the 
                        period at the end of clause (ii) and inserting

                        new subparagraph:
                    ``(D) in the case of a trademark, service mark, or

                of its obligations to maintain the quality of the 
                products and services offered under or in connection 
                with the licensed trademark, service mark, or trade

                    (A) what additional discovery was requested and any 
                consistent pattern or trend in the reasons or

                secondary market has on the United States;
                    (C) to examine licensing and other oversight 
                requirements that may be placed on the patent secondary 
                market, including on the participants in such markets, 
                to ensure that the market is a level playing field and 
                that brokers in the market have the requisite expertise 
                and adhere to ethical business practices; and
                    (D) to examine the requirements placed on other

                            (i) do not own a financial instrument 
                        described in sections 316(a)(15) and 326(a)(14)

    (c) Codification of the Double-patenting Doctrine.--
            (1) Amendments.--
                    (A) Conditions for patentability; novelty.--Section

                inserting at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) Double-patenting Prior Art.--If a first claimed invention in 
a first patent was effectively filed on or before the effective filing 
date of a second claimed invention in a second patent or in the 
application on which the second patent issues, and the first claimed 
invention is not otherwise prior art to the second claimed invention 
under this section, then the first claimed invention shall, 
notwithstanding the other subsections of this section, constitute prior 
art to the second claimed invention under this subsection unless--
            ``(1) the second claimed invention is consonant with a 
        requirement for restriction under the first sentence of section 
        121 with respect to the claims issued in the first patent; or
            ``(2) an election has been recorded in the Office by the 
        owner of the second patent or the application on which the 
        second patent issues disclaiming the right to bring or maintain 
        a civil action under section 281 to enforce the second patent, 
        except that such disclaimer shall not apply if--
                    ``(A) the relief being sought in the civil action 
                would not constitute a cause of action barred by res 
                judicata had the asserted claims of the second patent 
                been issued in the first patent; and
                    ``(B) the owner of the first patent or the 
                application on which the first patent issues has 
                recorded an election limiting the enforcement of the 
                first patent relative to the second patent in the 
                manner described in this paragraph, the owner of the 
                first patent is a party to the civil action, or a 
                separate action under section 281 to enforce the first 
                patent can no longer be brought or maintained.''.
                    (B) Divisional applications.--Section 121 of title 
                35, United States Code, is amended by striking the 
                third sentence.
                    (C) Limitations.--Paragraph (2) of section 154(b) 
                of title 35, United States Code, is amended by 
                inserting at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(D) Patents subject to election.--If a patent is 
                subject to an election as described in section 
                102(e)(2) with respect to one or more other patents, 
                the adjusted term of the patent under this subsection 
                may not exceed a period of 17 years from the date of 
                issuance of any of such other patents and the portion 
                of any adjustment of the term of the patent under this 
                subsection that extends beyond the expiration of such 
                17-year period years shall be void.''.
            (2) Effective date, implementation, and other transition 
        provisions.--
                    (A) In general.--The amendments made by paragraph 
                (1) shall be effective as if included in the amendment 
                made by section 3(b)(1) of the Leahy-Smith America 
                Invents Act (Public Law 112-29).
                    (B) Savings clause.--If a second claimed invention 
                in a second patent issued before the date of the 
                enactment of this Act is subject to the amendments made 
                by paragraph (1) and would not have been invalid had 
                the amendments made by paragraph (1) and the provisions 
                of this paragraph not been enacted, then, 
                notwithstanding section 102(e) of title 35, United 
                States Code, as added by paragraph (1), prior art under 
                such section 102(e) may not be considered in 
                determining the validity of such second claimed 
                invention.
                    (C) Provisional rejections to continue.--If a first 
                claimed invention in a first application for patent 
                subject to the amendments under paragraph (1) would, if 
                issued as a patent, constitute prior art under section 
                102(e) of title 35, United States Code, as added by 
                paragraph (1), with respect to a second claimed 
                invention in a second application, the first claimed 
                invention may be provisionally cited by the Office as 
                prior art in a notice under section 132 of title 35, 
                United States Code, in connection with the examination 
                of the second claimed invention.
                    (D) Patent term; rule of construction.--
                            (i) In general.--If the term of a patent is 
                        based upon the amendments made to subsection 
                        (a) of section 154, title 35, United States 
                        Code, by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act 
                        (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4809)--
                                    (I) the patent term as provided 
                                under subsection (a) of such section 
                                154, any adjustment to said term as 
                                provided under subsection (b) of such 
                                section 154, and any extension of such 
                                term as provided under section 156 of 
                                title 35, United States Code, shall not 
                                constitute, nor be deemed by the Office 
                                or the courts to constitute, an 
                                unjustified period of protection under 
                                the patent or an unjustified extension 
                                of the right to exclude under the 
                                patent relative to an earlier-expiring 
                                patent;
                                    (II) the Office shall not condition 
                                the issuance of such a patent on a 
                                disclaimer of any portion of the term 
                                of the patent; and
                                    (III) the Office may condition the 
                                issuance of such a patent on the making 
                                of an election as described in section 
                                102(e)(2) of title 35, United States 
                                Code, as added by paragraph (1) in lieu 
                                of the filing of a disclaimer with 
                                respect to the ownership or separate 
                                enforcement of the patent that would 
                                otherwise be required by the Office in 
                                cases of non-statutory double 
                                patenting.
                            (ii) Disclaimers in pending applications.--
                        A terminal disclaimer made in connection with 
                        an application for patent with respect to one 
                        or more other applications or patents shall be 
                        given no effect and shall be treated as having 
                        never been made if--
                                    (I) within one year after the date 
                                of the enactment of this Act, an 
                                election as described in section 
                                102(e)(2) of title 35, United State 
                                Code, as added by paragraph (1), has 
                                been made in connection with the 
                                application or any patent issuing 
                                thereon and has effect with respect to 
                                each such other application or patent 
                                with respect to which the disclaimer 
                                was made;
                                    (II) the application was pending 
                                before the Office on or after July 1, 
                                2015; and
                                    (III) the term of a patent issued 
                                on the application would be based upon 
                                the amendments made to subsection (a) 
                                of section 154 of title 35, United 
                                States Code, by the Uruguay Round 
                                Agreements Act.
                            (iii) Disclaimers otherwise unaffected.--
                        Except as provided in clause (ii), nothing in 
                        this subsection shall be construed to negate 
                        the effect of a terminal disclaimer limiting 
                        the enforcement of a patent issued on or before 
                        the date of the enactment of this Act.
                            (iv) Terminal disclaimer defined.--In this 
                        subparagraph, the term ``terminal disclaimer'' 
                        has the meaning as such term is described in 
                        section 1.321 of title 37, Code of Federal 
                        Regulations.

                        of this Act may not be held invalid on any 
                        nonstatutory double-patenting ground.
                            (ii) First-to-invent patents.--A claimed 
                        invention of a patent not described in section 
                        3(n)(1) of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act 
                        and issued before, on, or after the date of the 
                        enactment of this Act may not be held invalid 
                        with respect to a claimed invention of another 
                        patent based on any nonstatutory double 
                        patenting ground if one of the claimed 
                        inventions is prior art to the other claimed 
                        invention under section 102 of title 35, United 
                        States Code, as in effect on the day prior to 
                        the effective date of the amendments made by 
                        section 3(b)(1) of the Leahy-Smith America 
                        Invents Act.
                    (F) Effect of rule of construction and exclusive 
                rules.--Subparagraphs (D) and (E) shall take effect on 
                the date of the enactment of this Act, except that they

                brought before such date.
    (d) PTO Patent Reviews.--
            (1) Clarification.--
                    (A) Scope of prior art.--Section 18(a)(1)(C)(i) of 
                the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (35 U.S.C. 321 
                note) is amended by striking ``section 102(a)'' and 
                inserting ``subsection (a) or (e) of section 102''.
                    (B) Effective date.--The amendment made by 
                subparagraph (A) shall take effect on the date of the 
                enactment of this Act and shall apply to any proceeding 
                pending on, or filed on or after, such date of 
                enactment.
            (2) Authority to waive fee.--Subject to available 
        resources, the Director may waive payment of a filing fee for a 
        transitional proceeding described under section 18(a) of the

            (3) Proceeding consolidation clarification.--Section 315(c) 
        of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(c) Joinder.--

        inter partes review, the Director, in his or her discretion, 
        may join as a party to that inter partes review any person who 
        meets the requirement of properly filing a petition under 
        section 311 that the Director, after receiving a preliminary 
        response under section 313 or the expiration of the time for 
        filing such a response, determines warrants the institution of 
        an inter partes review under section 314.
            ``(2) Joinder of later filed petition.--For good cause 
        shown, the Director may allow a party who files a petition that 
        meets the requirement described in paragraph (1) and concerns 
        the patent of a pending inter partes review to join the 
        petition to the pending review.''.
    (e) Clarification of Jurisdiction.--
            (1) In general.--An action or claim arises under an Act of 
        Congress relating to patents if such action or claim--
                    (A) necessarily requires resolution of a disputed 
                question as to the validity of a patent or the scope of 
                a patent claim; or
                    (B) is an action or claim for legal malpractice 
                that arises from an attorney's conduct in relation to 
                an action or claim arising under an Act of Congress 
                relating to patents (including as described in 
                paragraph (1)).
            (2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1)--
                    (A) shall apply to all cases filed on or after, or 
                pending on, the date of the enactment of this Act; and
                    (B) shall not apply to a case in which a Federal
