SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping Guns From Criminals Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF A FIREARM TO A 
              PROHIBITED PERSON MADE INTO A STRICT LIABILITY CRIME WITH 
              AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.

    (a) In General.--Section 922(d) of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in the 1st sentence--
                    (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by 
                striking ``any person knowing or having reasonable 
                cause to believe that such person'' and inserting 
                ``another person who'';
                    (B) in each of paragraphs (5) and (7), by striking 
                ``who,''; and
                    (C) in paragraph (6), by striking ``who''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``It shall be an 
        affirmative defense to a prosecution under this subsection that 
        the defendant can prove by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that, at the time of the sale or other disposition of the 
        firearm, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
        established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence 
        Prevention Act had indicated to any person that a sale or other 
        disposition of a firearm to the recipient would not be 
        unlawful, or the recipient possessed a valid permit, issued to 
        the recipient by the State in which the sale or other 
        disposition occurred, which authorizes the carrying of a 
        concealed weapon, unless the defendant knew or had reasonable 
        cause to believe that this subsection prohibited the sale or 
        disposition of a firearm or ammunition to the recipient or that 
        subsection (g) prohibited the recipient from receiving a 
        firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in 
        interstate or foreign commerce.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 924(a)(2) of such title is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``(d),''; and
            (2) by inserting ``, or violates subsection (d),'' before 
        ``of section 922''.
