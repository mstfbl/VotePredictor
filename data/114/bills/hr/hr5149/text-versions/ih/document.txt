To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for the circumstances 
      under which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall provide

SECTION 1. SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS REIMBURSEMENT FOR EMERGENCY 
              AMBULANCE SERVICES.

is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(5) In delineating the circumstances under which reimbursement 
may be made under this section for ambulance services for an 
individual, the Secretary shall treat such services as emergency 
services for which reimbursement may be made under this section if the 
Secretary determines that--
            ``(A) the request for ambulance services was made as a 
        result of the sudden onset of a medical condition of such a 
        nature that a prudent layperson who possesses an average 
        knowledge of health and medicine--
                    ``(i) would have reasonably expected that a delay 
                in seeking immediate medical attention would have been 
                hazardous to the life or health of the individual; or
                    ``(ii) could reasonably expect the absence of 
                immediate medical attention to result in placing the 
                health of the individual in serious jeopardy, the 
                serious impairment of bodily functions, or the serious 
                dysfunction of any bodily organ or part; and
            ``(B) the individual is transported to the closest and most 
        appropriate medical facility capable of treating such emergency 
        medical condition.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to ambulance services provided on or after January 
1, 2016.
                                 <all>
