 To protect consumers from discriminatory State taxes on motor vehicle 
                                rentals.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``End Discriminatory State Taxes for 
Automobile Renters Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress has prohibited economic protectionism by State 
        and local governments that unduly burden or discriminate 
        against interstate commerce and transportation under the 
        authority granted by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution by 
        enacting laws such as the Railroad Revitalization and 
        Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 
        the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, and the Airport and 
        Airway Improvement Act of 1982.
            (2) In Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824), a case 
        challenging the exclusive right of navigating the waters of New 
        York granted by that State, the Supreme Court affirmed that it 
        is the sole right of Congress to regulate commerce between the 
        States under what Chief Justice John Marshall recognized as the 
        dormant Commerce Clause.
            (3) Since 1990, over 100 discriminatory taxes have been 
        imposed by State and local governments on motor vehicle rentals 
        in violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to prohibit prospectively, 
and provide a remedy for, tax discrimination by a State or Locality 
against the rental of motor vehicles.

                have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the 
                evidence, that the tax is the equivalent of a tax 
                imposed on other commercial and industrial taxpayers 
                under paragraph (2).
            ``(4) Other remedies.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        limit any cause of action or remedy available under any other
