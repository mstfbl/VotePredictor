                            ``(i) the amount of interest paid to the 
                        taxpayer on such deposit for the calendar year, 
                        and
                            ``(ii) the aggregate charitable 
                        contribution from such deposit during the

                        contribution from such shares during the 
                        calendar year.
            ``(2) Account limitation.--The amount excluded from gross 
        income by subsection (a) from an account for a calendar year 
        shall not exceed $50.
    ``(c) Qualified Program.--For purposes of this section--

        program adopted by a financial institution or a money market 
        fund (as the case may be) under which--
                    ``(A) the owner of a deposit in the financial 
                institution or of shares in the money market fund--
                            ``(i) elects to participate in the program,
                            ``(ii) elects the amount of donation from 
                        the owner's deposit or shares, and
                            ``(iii) designates an entity described in 
                        section 170(c) to receive the donation, and
                    ``(B) the financial institution or money market 
                fund makes, directly or through a qualified aggregator, 
                a contribution of the amount elected under subparagraph 
                (A)(ii) to the entity designated under subparagraph 
                (A)(iii).
            ``(2) Qualified aggregator.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified aggregator' 
                means an organization--
                            ``(i) which is described in section 
                        501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 
                        501(a), and
                            ``(ii) the purpose of which is to 
                        facilitate charitable contributions under a 
                        qualified program by aggregating contributions 
                        from deposits and funds and payments to 
                        entities designated to receive such payments.
                    ``(B) Administrative costs.--An entity shall not 
                fail to be treated as a qualified aggregator solely 
                because the entity retains a portion of contributions 
                from deposits and funds to cover its administrative 
                costs if the qualified aggregator provides notice in 
                advance of its intent to retain such a portion. The 
                notice need not specify the exact amount or percentage 
                of the amount to be retained.
                    ``(C) Special rule regarding status to receive 
                charitable contributions.--A program shall not fail to 
                be described in paragraph (1) merely because the 
                ultimate recipient of a contribution is ineligible to 
                receive charitable contributions so long as the 
                qualified aggregator and the financial institution or 
                money market fund (as the case may be) made an initial 
                good faith determination that contributions to 
                recipients under the program would be qualified under 
                section 170(c) to receive charitable contributions. For 
                purposes of the preceding sentence, a financial 
                institution or money market fund may rely upon the 
                representation of the qualified aggregator that the 
                organizations to which distributions will be made 
                qualify under section 170(c) to receive charitable 
                contributions.
    ``(d) Other Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) Deposit.--The term `deposit' means any deposit,
