            ``(9) Distribution of additional residency positions.--
                    ``(A) Reductions in limit based on unused 
                positions.--
                            ``(i) In general.--If a hospital's 
                        reference resident level (as defined in 
                        subparagraph (G)(i)) is less than the otherwise 
                        applicable resident limit (as defined in 
                        subparagraph (G)(iii)), effective for portions

                        limit shall be reduced by 65 percent of the 
                        difference between such otherwise applicable 
                        resident limit and such reference resident 
                        level.

                        fewer than 250 acute care inpatient beds.

                        applicable resident limit for each qualifying 
                        hospital that submits an application under this
