          relating to nonimmigrant visas issued under section 
       101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of such Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthen Employment And Seasonal 
Opportunities Now (SEASON) Act''.

SEC. 2. H-2B NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS.

    (a) In General.--Section 214(g)(9)(A) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(9)(A)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), an alien who has 
already been counted toward the numerical limitation of paragraph 
(1)(B) during 1 of the 3 fiscal years preceding a fiscal year shall not 
again be counted toward such limitation during that fiscal year. Such 
an alien shall be considered a returning worker.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect as if enacted on January 1, 2015.

SEC. 3. H-2B TEMPORARY NON-AGRICULTURAL WORK VISA PROGRAM.

    (a) Definition.--Section 214(g)(9) of the Immigration and

the following:
    ``(D) For purposes of section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), the term `other 
temporary service or labor' means that an employer's need for labor 
will last not more than 1 year and is a seasonal, peak load, or 
intermittent need, unless it is a one-time occurrence lasting not 
longer than 3 years. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a 
`seasonal' need for labor is a need for labor that lasts not longer 
than 10 months.''.
    (b) Admission of Temporary H-2B Workers.--Chapter 2 of title II of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1181 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 218 the following:
``Sec. 218A. Admission of temporary H-2B workers
    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) The term `H-2B worker' means a nonimmigrant described 
        in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b).
            ``(2) The term `United States worker' means any worker who 
        is--
                    ``(A) a citizen or national of the United States; 
                or

                permanent residence, is admitted as a refugee under

                an immigrant otherwise authorized by this Act to be 
                employed.
            ``(3) The term `displace' means to lay off a worker from a 
        job that is essentially equivalent to the job for which an H-2B 
        worker is sought. A job shall not be considered to be 
        `essentially equivalent' to another job unless the job--
                    ``(A) involves essentially the same 
                responsibilities as such other job;
                    ``(B) was held by a United States worker with 
                substantially equivalent qualifications and experience;

                    ``(A) means to cause a worker's loss of employment, 
                other than through a discharge for inadequate 
                performance, violation of workplace rules, cause, 
                voluntary departure, voluntary retirement, or the 
                expiration of a grant or contract (other than a 
                temporary employment contract entered into in order to 
                evade a condition described in subsection (b)(2)(G)); 
                and
                    ``(B) does not include any situation in which the 
                worker is offered, as an alternative to such loss of 
                employment, a similar employment opportunity with the 
                same employer at equivalent or higher compensation and 
                benefits than the position from which the employee was 
                discharged, regardless of whether or not the employee 
                accepts the offer.

                collective bargaining agreement that was negotiated at 
                arms' length between the union and the employer, the 
                wage rate set forth in the collective bargaining 
                agreement;
