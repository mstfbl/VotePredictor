    (a) TSA PreCheck.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall--
            (1) ensure that all screening of passengers and their 
        accessible property shall be conducted in a risk-based, 
        intelligence-driven manner with consideration given to the 
        privacy and civil liberties of such passengers; and
            (2) operate a trusted passenger screening program known as 
        ``TSA PreCheck'' that provides expedited screening for low-risk 
        passengers and their accessible property based on a 
        comprehensive and continuous analysis of factors specified in 
        subsection (b).
    (b) Factors.--Factors referred to in subsection (a)(2) shall 
include the following:
            (1) Whether passengers described in such subsection are 
        members of other trusted traveler programs of the Department.
            (2) Whether such passengers are traveling pursuant to 
        subsection (m) of section 44903 of title 49, United States Code 
        (as established under the Risk-Based Security for Members of 
        the Armed Forces Act (Public Law 112-86)), section 44927 of 
        such title (as established under the Helping Heroes Fly Act 
        (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 of such title (as 
        established under the Honor Flight Act (Public Law 113-221)).
            (3) Whether such passengers possess an active security 
        clearance or other credential issued by the Federal Government 
        for which TSA has conducted a written threat assessment and 
        determined that such passengers present a low risk to 
        transportation or national security.
            (4) Whether such passengers are members of a population for 
        whom TSA has conducted a written security threat assessment, 
        determined that such population poses a low risk to 
        transportation or national security, and has issued such 
        passengers a known traveler number.
            (5) The ability of the Administration to verify such 
        passengers' identity and whether such passengers pose a risk to 
        aviation security.
            (6) Threats to transportation or national security as 
        identified by the intelligence community and law enforcement 
        community.
    (c) Enrollment Expansion.--

        the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish 
        PreCheck application enrollment standards to add multiple 
        private sector application capabilities for the TSA PreCheck 
        program to increase the public's enrollment access to such 
        program, including standards that allow the use of secure 
        technologies, including online enrollment, kiosks, tablets, or 
        staffed computer stations at which individuals can apply for 
        entry into such program.
            (2) Requirements.--Upon publication of the PreCheck program 
        application enrollment standards pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
        Administrator shall--
                    (A) coordinate with interested parties to deploy 
                TSA-approved ready-to-market private sector solutions 
                that meet the TSA PreCheck application enrollment 
                standards described in paragraph (1), make available 
                additional PreCheck enrollment capabilities, and offer 
                secure online and mobile enrollment opportunities;
                    (B) partner with the private sector to collect 
                biographic and biometric identification information via 
                kiosks, mobile devices, or other mobile enrollment 
                platforms to reduce the number of instances in which 
                passengers need to travel to enrollment centers;
                    (C) ensure that the kiosks, mobile devices, or 
                other mobile enrollment platforms referred to in 
                subparagraph (E) are secure and not vulnerable to data 
                breaches;
                    (D) ensure that any biometric and biographic 
                information is collected in a manner which is 
                comparable with the National Institute of Standards and 
                Technology standards and ensures privacy and data 
                security protections, including that applicants' 
                personally identifiable information is collected, 
                retained, used, and shared in a manner consistent with 
                section 552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
                known as the ``Privacy Act of 1974''), and agency 
                regulations;
                    (E) ensure that an individual who wants to enroll 
                in the PreCheck program and has started an application 
                with a single identification verification at one 
                location will be able to save such individual's 
                application on any kiosk, personal computer, mobile 
                device, or other mobile enrollment platform and be able 
                to return within a reasonable time to submit a second 
                identification verification; and
                    (F) ensure that any enrollment expansion using a 
                private sector risk assessment instead of a 
                fingerprint-based criminal history records check is 
                determined, by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to 
                be equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history 
                records check conducted through the Federal Bureau of 
                Investigation.
            (3) Marketing of precheck program.--Upon publication of 
        PreCheck program application enrollment standards pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall--
                    (A) in accordance with such standards, develop and 
                implement--
                            (i) a process, including an associated 
                        timeframe, for approving private sector 
                        marketing of the TSA PreCheck program; and
                            (ii) a strategy for partnering with the 
                        private sector to encourage enrollment in such 
                        program; and
                    (B) submit to Congress a report on any PreCheck 
                fees collected in excess of the costs of administering 
                such program, including recommendations for using such 
                amounts to support marketing of such program under this 
                subsection.
            (4) Identity verification enhancement.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Administrator shall--
                    (A) coordinate with the heads of appropriate 
                components of the Department to leverage Department-
                held data and technologies to verify the citizenship of 
                individuals enrolling in the TSA PreCheck program; and
                    (B) partner with the private sector to use advanced 
                biometrics and standards comparable with National 
                Institute of Standards and Technology standards to 
                facilitate enrollment in such program.
            (5) Precheck lane operation.--The Administrator shall--
                    (A) ensure that TSA PreCheck screening lanes are 
                open and available during peak and high-volume travel 
                times at airports to individuals enrolled in the 
                PreCheck program; and
                    (B) make every practicable effort to provide 
                expedited screening at standard screening lanes during 
                times when PreCheck screening lanes are closed to 
                individuals enrolled in such program in order to 
                maintain operational efficiency.
            (6) Vetting for precheck participants.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Administrator shall initiate an assessment of the security 
        vulnerabilities in the vetting process for the PreCheck program 
        that includes an evaluation of whether subjecting PreCheck 
        participants to recurrent fingerprint-based criminal history 
        records checks, in addition to recurrent checks against the 
        terrorist watchlist, could be done in a cost-effective manner 
        to strengthen the security of the PreCheck program.

SEC. 102. PRECHECK AND GENERAL PASSENGER BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct a pilot project to 
establish a secure, automated, biometric-based system at airports to 
verify the identity of passengers who are members of TSA PreCheck. Such 
system shall--
            (1) reduce the need for security screening personnel to 
        perform travel document verification for individuals enrolled 
        in TSA PreCheck;
            (2) reduce the average wait time of individuals enrolled in 
        TSA PreCheck;
            (3) reduce overall operating expenses of the 
        Administration;
            (4) be integrated with the Administration's watch list and 
        trusted traveler matching program;
            (5) be integrated with other checkpoint technologies to 
        further facilitate risk-based passenger screening at the 
        checkpoint, to the extent practicable and consistent with 
        security standards; and
            (6) consider capabilities and policies of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection's Global Entry Program, as appropriate.
    (b) Establishment of Screening System for Certain Passengers.--
Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (l) as 
        subsections (d) through (m), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(c) Establishment of Screening System for Certain Passengers.--
Not later than December 31, 2017, in accordance with the requirements 
of the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement 
Act of 2015, the Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration shall establish a secure, automated system at all large 
hub airports for verifying travel and identity documents of passengers 
who are not members of the Administration's risk-based aviation 
passenger screening program, known as `TSA PreCheck'. Such system 
shall--
            ``(1) assess the need for security screening personnel to 
        perform travel document verification for such passengers, 
        thereby assessing the overall number of such screening 
        personnel;
            ``(2) assess the average wait time of such passengers;
            ``(3) assess overall operating expenses of the 
        Administration;
            ``(4) be integrated with the Administration's watch list 
        matching program; and
            ``(5) be integrated with other checkpoint technologies to 
        further facilitate risk-based passenger screening at the 
        checkpoint, to the extent practicable and consistent with 
        security standards.''.

SEC. 103. LIMITATION; PRECHECK OPERATIONS MAINTAINED; ALTERNATE 
              METHODS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the 
Administrator shall direct that access to expedited airport security 
screening at an airport security checkpoint be limited to only the 
following:
            (1) A passenger who voluntarily submits biographic and 
        biometric information for a security risk assessment and whose 
        application for the PreCheck program has been approved, or a 
        passenger who is a participant in another trusted or registered 
        traveler program of the Department.
            (2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of 
        title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk-
        Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public Law 
        112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established under the 
        Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 
        of such title (as established under the Honor Flight Act 
        (Public Law 113-221)).
            (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic 
        and biometric information for a security risk assessment but is 
        a member of a population designated by the Administrator as 
        known and low-risk and who may be issued a unique, known 
        traveler number by the Administrator determining that such 
        passenger is a member of a category of travelers designated by 
        the Administrator as known and low-risk.
    (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall ensure that expedited airport security 
screening remains available to passengers at or above the level that 
exists on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator determines that such is 
appropriate, the implementation of subsection (a) may be delayed by up 
to 1 year with respect to the population of passengers who did not 
voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for security 
risk assessments but who nevertheless receive expedited airport 
security screening because such passengers are designated as frequent 
fliers by air carriers. If the Administrator uses the authority 
provided by this subsection, the Administrator shall notify the 
Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of 
such phased-in implementation.
    (d) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator may provide access to 
expedited airport security screening to additional passengers pursuant 
to an alternate method upon the submission to the Committee on Homeland 
Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate of an independent assessment 
of the security effectiveness of such alternate method that is 
conducted by an independent entity that determines that such alternate 
method is designed to--
            (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely 
        pose a low risk to the United States aviation system;
            (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a 
        security threat to the United States aviation system is 
        selected for expedited security screening; and
            (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United 
        States aviation system.
    (e) Information Sharing.--The Administrator shall provide to the 
entity conducting the independent assessment under subsection (d) 
effectiveness testing results that are consistent with established 
evaluation design practices, as identified by the Comptroller General 
of the United States.
    (f) Reporting.--Not later than 3 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Administrator shall 
report to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate on the percentage of all passengers who 
are provided expedited security screening, and of such passengers so 
provided, the percentage who are participants in the PreCheck program 
(who have voluntarily submitted biographic and biometric information 
for security risk assessments), the percentage who are participants in 
another trusted traveler program of the Department, the percentage who 
are participants in the PreCheck program due to the Administrator's 
issuance of known traveler numbers, and for the remaining percentage of 
passengers granted access to expedited security screening in PreCheck 
security lanes, information on the percentages attributable to each 
alternative method utilized by the Administration to direct passengers 
to expedited airport security screening at PreCheck security lanes.
    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
to--
            (1) authorize or direct the Administrator to reduce or 
        limit the availability of expedited security screening at an 
        airport; or
            (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use 
        technologies and systems, including passenger screening canines 
        and explosives trace detection, as a part of security screening 
        operations.

SEC. 104. SECURE FLIGHT PROGRAM.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator shall--
            (1) develop a process for regularly evaluating the root 
        causes of screening errors at checkpoints across airports so 
        that corrective measures are able to be identified;
            (2) implement such corrective measures to address the root 
        causes of such screening errors occurring at the checkpoint;
            (3) develop additional measures to address key performance 
        aspects related to the Secure Flight program goals and ensure 
        that such measures clearly identify activities necessary to 
        achieve progress towards such goals;
            (4) develop a mechanism to systematically document the 
        number and causes of Secure Flight program matching errors for 
        the purpose of improving program performance and provide 
        program managers with timely and reliable information;
            (5) provide job-specific privacy refresher training for 
        Secure Flight program staff to further protect personally 
        identifiable information in the Secure Flight system program; 
        and
            (6) develop a mechanism to comprehensively document and 
        track key Secure Flight program privacy issues and decisions to 
        ensure the Secure Flight program has complete information for 
        effective oversight of its privacy controls.

SEC. 105. EFFICIENCY REVIEW BY TSA.

    (a) Review Required.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct and complete a 
comprehensive, agency-wide efficiency review of the Administration to 
identify spending reductions and administrative savings through the 
streamlining and any necessary restructuring of agency divisions to 
make the Administration more efficient. In carrying out the review 
under this section, the Administrator shall consider each of the 
following:
            (1) The elimination of any duplicative or overlapping 
        programs and initiatives that can be streamlined.
            (2) The elimination of any unnecessary or obsolete rules, 
        regulations, directives, or procedures.
            (3) Any other matters the Administrator determines are 
        appropriate.
    (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after the 
completion of the efficiency review required under subsection (a), the 
Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a report that specifies the results and 
cost savings expected to be achieved through such efficiency review. 
Such report shall also include information relating to how the 
Administration may use efficiencies identified through such efficiency 
review to provide funding to reimburse airports that incurred eligible 
costs for in-line baggage screening systems.

SEC. 106. DONATION OF SCREENING EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator is authorized to donate security 
screening equipment to a foreign last-point-of-departure airport 
operator if such equipment can be reasonably expected to mitigate a 
specific vulnerability to the security of the United States or United 
States citizens.

    ``(a) In General.--By not later than December 31, 2015, the 
Administrator, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary for Policy 
of the Department, shall request from the Director of National 
Intelligence access to additional data from the Terrorist Identities 
Datamart Environment (TIDE) data and any or other terrorism-related 
information to improve the effectiveness of the Administration's 
credential vetting program for individuals with unescorted access to 
sensitive areas of airports.
    ``(b) Security Inspection.--By not later than December 31, 2015, 
the Administrator shall issue guidance for Transportation Security 
Inspectors to annually review airport badging office procedures for 
applicants seeking access to sensitive areas of airports. Such guidance 
shall include a comprehensive review of applicants' Criminal History 
Records Check (CHRC) and work authorization documentation during the

Investigation, to determine the feasibility of full implementation of a 
service through which the Administrator would be notified of a change 
in status of an individual holding a valid credential granting 
unescorted access to sensitive areas of airports across eligible 
Administration-regulated populations.
    ``(d) Procedures.--The pilot program under subsection (c) shall 
evaluate whether information can be narrowly tailored to ensure that 
the Administrator only receives notification of a change with respect 
to a disqualifying offense under the credential vetting program under 
subsection (a), as specified in 49 CFR 1542.209, and in a manner that 
complies with current regulations for fingerprint-based criminal 
history records checks. The pilot program shall be carried out in a 
manner so as to ensure that, in the event that notification is made 
through the Rap Back Service of a change but a determination of arrest 
status or conviction is in question, the matter will be handled in a 
manner that is consistent with current regulations. The pilot program 
shall also be carried out in a manner that is consistent with current 
regulations governing an investigation of arrest status, correction of 
Federal Bureau of Investigation records and notification of 
disqualification, and corrective action by the individual who is the 
subject of an inquiry.
    ``(e) Determination and Submission.--If the Administrator 
determines that full implementation of the Rap Back Service is feasible 
and can be carried out in a manner that is consistent with current 
regulations for fingerprint-based criminal history checks, including 
the rights of individuals seeking credentials, the Administrator shall 
submit such determination, in writing, to the Committee on Homeland 
Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate, together with information on 
the costs associated with such implementation, including the costs 
incurred by the private sector. In preparing this determination, the 
Administrator shall consult with the Chief Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties Officer of the Department to ensure that protocols are in 
place to align the period of retention of personally identifiable 
information and biometric information, including fingerprints, in the 
Rap Back Service with the period in which the individual who is the 
subject of an inquiry has a valid credential.
    ``(f) Credential Security.--By not later than September 30, 2015, 
the Administrator shall issue guidance to airports mandating that all 
federalized airport badging authorities place an expiration date on 
airport credentials commensurate with the period of time during which 
an individual is lawfully authorized to work in the United States.
    ``(g) Aviation Worker Lawful Status.--By not later than December 
31, 2015, the Administrator shall review the denial of credentials due 
to issues associated with determining an applicant's lawful status in 
order to identify airports with specific weaknesses and shall 
coordinate with such airports to mutually address such weaknesses, as 
appropriate.
    ``(h) Reports to Congress.--Upon completion of the determinations 
and reviews required under this section, the Administrator shall brief 
the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the results of 
such determinations and reviews.''.

Act, the Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Homeland 
Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce,

        intelligence community (as such term is defined in section 3(4) 
        of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)), to 
        help businesses, particularly small businesses, commercialize 
        innovative security-related technologies.
            (2) Enhanced engagement, either through the Science and 
        Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security 
        or directly, with the In-Q-tel program described in paragraph 
        (1).

            Passed the House of Representatives February 23, 2016.
