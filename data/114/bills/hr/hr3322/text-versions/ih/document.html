    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) High-performance energy efficiency measure.--The term

        given that term in section 424.
            ``(2) Residence star program.--The term `Residence Star 
        program' means the voluntary program established under

        written agreement.
    ``(b) Residence Star.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
enactment of this section, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish 
a voluntary program within the Energy Star program established by 
section 324A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6294a), which may be known as Residence Star, to promote energy 
efficiency in separate residential spaces.
    ``(c) Recognition of Separate Residential Spaces.--
            ``(1) Occupancy-based recognition.--In establishing the 
        Residence Star program, the Administrator shall, following 
        public notice and an opportunity for comment--
                    ``(A) in a manner similar to the Energy Star rating

                procedures to recognize separate residential spaces 
                with respect to which the owner of the separate 
                residential space voluntarily achieves high levels of 
                energy efficiency;
                    ``(B) establish building occupancy categories

                owner of the separate residential space lowers energy 
                consumption.
            ``(2) Design- and construction-based recognition.--In 
        establishing the Residence Star program, the Administrator, 
        following public notice and an opportunity for comment, shall

                Residence Star program, the Administrator shall require 
                that in order for a separate residential space to be 
                eligible to maintain recognition under this subsection, 
                the owner of the separate residential space shall, not 
                later than 7 years after the date on which the initial 
                audit is conducted under subparagraph (A), and every 7 
                years thereafter, submit the separate residential space
