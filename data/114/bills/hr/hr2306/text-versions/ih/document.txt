                        under clause (i) cannot exceed the number of 
                        dependents allocated to the other spouse by 
                        more than 1 dependent.
                    ``(D) Treatment of premiums.--To the extent that 
                the amount of any monthly premium is determined 
                separately with respect to either spouse or any 
                dependent of the taxpayer, such premium shall be taken 
                into account by such spouse or the spouse to which such 
                dependent is allocated under subparagraph (C). In the 
                case of any monthly premium which is not so separately 
                determined, such premium may be allocated between the 
                two spouses at the election of the taxpayer.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.
