                through 2021.
    (b) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers 
                continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- 
                and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
                federally assisted surface transportation markets 
                across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.

                        economically disadvantaged individual or

                individuals.--The term ``socially and economically

                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations 
                issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be

            (5) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish 
                minimum uniform criteria for use by State governments

        the entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
        complying with paragraph (3) because a Federal court issues a 
        final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the 
        implementation of paragraph (3) is unconstitutional.
            (8) Sense of congress on prompt payment of dbe 
        subcontractors.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the Secretary should take additional steps to 
                ensure that recipients comply with section 26.29 of

                disadvantaged business enterprises prompt payment

                and regulations administered by the Secretary; and
                    (B) such additional steps should include increasing 
                the Department's ability to track and keep records of 
                complaints and to make that information publicly 
                available.

years 2016 through 2021--
            (1) revise a distribution of the obligation authority made

        obligate amounts in addition to those previously distributed

                years; and
                    (B) be in addition to the amount of any limitation 
                imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and 
                highway safety construction programs for future fiscal 
                years.

            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        distribution of obligation authority under subsection (c) for 
        each of fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the Secretary shall 
        distribute to the States any funds (excluding funds authorized

                to the States (or will not be apportioned to the States 
                under section 204 of title 23, United States Code), and 
                will not be available for obligation, for the fiscal 
                year because of the imposition of any obligation 
                limitation for the fiscal year.
            (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 
        in the same proportion as the distribution of obligation

        paragraph (1) shall be available for any purpose described in

SEC. 5107. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT CALCULATION.

    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--
            (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula for the 
        motor carrier safety assistance program has not been 
        established under this subtitle for fiscal year 2017, the 
        Secretary shall calculate for fiscal year 2017 the maintenance 
        of effort baseline required under section 31102(f) of title 49, 
        United States Code, as amended by this subtitle, by averaging 
        the expenditures for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 required by 
        section 31102(b)(4) of title 49, United States Code, as that 
        section was in effect on the day before the date of enactment 
        of this Act.
            (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may use the 
        methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort baseline 
        specified in paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2018 and subsequent 
        fiscal years if a new allocation formula for the motor carrier 
        safety assistance program has not been established for that 
        fiscal year.
    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)(B), 
        beginning on the date that a new allocation formula for the 
        motor carrier safety assistance program is established under 
        this subtitle, upon the request of a State, the Secretary may 
        waive or modify the baseline maintenance of effort required of 
        the State by section 31102(e) of title 49, United States Code, 
        as amended by this subtitle, for the purpose of establishing a 
        new baseline maintenance of effort if the Secretary determines 
        that a waiver or modification--
                    (A) is equitable due to reasonable circumstances;
                    (B) will ensure the continuation of commercial 
                motor vehicle enforcement activities in the State; and
                    (C) is necessary to ensure that the total amount of 
                State maintenance of effort and matching expenditures 
                required under sections 31102 and 31104 of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by this subtitle, does 
                not exceed a sum greater than the average of the total 
                amount of State maintenance of effort and matching 
                expenditures required under those sections for the 3 
                fiscal years prior to the date of enactment of this 
                Act.
            (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a State, the 
        Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort baseline 
        referred to in paragraph (1) for the State according to the 
        following methodology:
                    (A) The Secretary shall establish the maintenance 
                of effort baseline for the State using the average 
                baseline of fiscal years 2004 and 2005, as required by 
                section 31102(b)(4) of title 49, United States Code, as 
                that section was in effect on the day before the date 
                of enactment of this Act.
                    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average 
                required match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle 
                safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for 
                motor carrier safety assistance grants established at 
                20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, United States 
                Code, as that section was in effect on the day before 
                the date of enactment of this Act.
                    (C) The Secretary shall calculate the estimated 
                match required under section 31104(b) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by this subtitle.
                    (D) The Secretary shall subtract the amount in 
                subparagraph (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) 
                and--
                            (i) if the number is greater than 0, the 
                        Secretary shall subtract the number from the 
                        amount in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, 
                        the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance 
                        of effort using the methodology in subparagraph 
                        (A).
            (3) Maintenance of effort amount.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall use the amount 
                calculated under paragraph (2) as the baseline 
                maintenance of effort required under section 31102(f) 
                of title 49, United States Code, as amended by this 
                subtitle.
                    (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request a waiver 
                or modification under this subsection before September 
                30 during the first fiscal year that the Secretary 
                implements a new allocation formula for the motor 
                carrier safety assistance program under this subtitle, 
                the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance of effort 
                using the methodology described in paragraph (2)(A).
            (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of 
        effort calculated under this section is the amount required 
        under section 31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as 
        amended by this subtitle.
    (c) Termination of Effectiveness.--The authority of the Secretary 
under this section shall terminate effective on the date that a new 
maintenance of effort baseline is calculated based on a new allocation 
formula for the motor carrier safety assistance program implemented 
under section 31102 of title 49, United States Code.

                                and Budget, after consultation with the 
                                project sponsor, may permit the 
                                Executive Director to authorize 
                                additional extensions of a permitting 
                                timetable beyond the limit prescribed

                                Congress with specificity why the 
                                original permitting timetable and the 
                                modifications authorized by the 
                                Executive Director failed to be 
                                adequate. The lead or facilitating 
                                agency, as applicable, shall transmit 
                                to Congress, the Director of the Office

                                completion date each year thereafter, 
                                until the permit review is completed or 
                                the project sponsor withdraws its 
                                notice or application or other request 
                                to which this title applies under 
                                section 41010.

                    (E) Consistency with other time periods.--A 
                permitting timetable established under subparagraph (A) 
                shall be consistent with any other relevant time 
                periods established under Federal law and shall not 
                prevent any cooperating or participating agency from 
                discharging any obligation under Federal law in

                        agency fails to conform with a completion date 
                        for agency action on a covered project or is at 
                        significant risk of failing to conform with 
                        such a completion date, the agency shall--
                                    (I) promptly submit to the

                        lead agency, as applicable, has a reasonable 
                        basis to doubt the continuing technical or 
                        financial ability of the project sponsor to 
                        construct the covered project, the facilitating

                in collaboration with each cooperating agency at 
                appropriate times during the environmental review, the 
                methodologies to be used and the level of detail 
                required in the analysis of each alternative for a 
                covered project.
                    (B) Environmental review.--A cooperating agency

        cooperating agencies with jurisdiction under Federal law and at 
        the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative 
        for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a 
        higher level of detail than other alternatives to facilitate 
        the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance 
        with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that 
        the development of the higher level of detail will not 
        prevent--
                    (A) the lead agency from making an impartial 
                decision as to whether to accept another alternative 
                that is being considered in the environmental review;

                    (A) the action is filed not later than 2 years 
                after the date of publication in the Federal Register 
                of the final record of decision or approval or denial

                        submitted a comment during the environmental 
                        review or a party that lacked a reasonable 
                        opportunity to submit a comment; and

                    (B) Separate action.--If Federal law requires the 
                preparation of a supplemental environmental impact 
                statement or other supplemental environmental document, 
                the preparation of such document shall be considered a

project sponsor in connection with review or authorization of a covered 
project, the court shall--
            (1) consider the effects on public health, safety, and the 
        environment, the potential for significant job losses, and 
        other economic harm resulting from an order or injunction; and
