    (b) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (A) while significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, 
        discrimination and related barriers continue to pose 
        significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses 
        seeking to do business in federally assisted surface 
        transportation markets across the United States;
            (B) the continuing barriers described in subparagraph (A) 
        merit the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program;
            (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, 
        which show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
        insufficient to address the problem;
            (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
        subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across the 
        United States poses a barrier to full and fair participation in 
        surface transportation-related businesses of women business 
        owners and minority business owners and has impacted firm 
        development and many aspects of surface transportation-related 
        business in the public and private markets; and
            (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
        subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
        compelling need for the continuation of the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program to address race and gender 
        discrimination in surface transportation-related business.
        (2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following definitions 
    apply:
            (A) Small business concern.--
                (i) In general.--The term ``small business concern'' 
            means a small business concern (as the term is used in 
            section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).
                (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``small business concern'' 
            does not include any concern or group of concerns 
            controlled by the same socially and economically 
            disadvantaged individual or individuals that have average 
            annual gross receipts during the preceding 3 fiscal years 
            in excess of $23,980,000, as adjusted annually by the 
            Secretary for inflation.
            (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.--
        The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals'' has the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of 
        the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant 
        subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except 
        that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection.
        (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the extent 
    that the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent 
    of the amounts made available for any program under titles I, II, 
    III, and VI of this Act and section 403 of title 23, United States 
    Code, shall be expended through small business concerns owned and 
    controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
        (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.--Each 
    State shall annually--
            (A) survey and compile a list of the small business 
        concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the State, including 
        the location of the small business concerns in the State; and
            (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the percentage of 
        the small business concerns that are controlled by--
                (i) women;
                (ii) socially and economically disadvantaged 
            individuals (other than women); and
                (iii) individuals who are women and are otherwise 
            socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
        (5) Uniform certification.--
            (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish minimum 
        uniform criteria for use by State governments in certifying 
        whether a concern qualifies as a small business concern for the 
        purpose of this subsection.
            (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria established 
        under subparagraph (A) shall include, with respect to a 
        potential small business concern--
                (i) on-site visits;
                (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;
                (iv) analyses of stock ownership;
                (v) listings of equipment;
                (vi) analyses of bonding capacity;
                (vii) listings of work completed;
                (viii) examination of the resumes of principal owners;
                (ix) analyses of financial capacity; and
                (x) analyses of the type of work preferred.
        (6) Reporting.--The Secretary shall establish minimum 
    requirements for use by State governments in reporting to the 
    Secretary--
            (A) information concerning disadvantaged business 
        enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and
            (B) such other information as the Secretary determines to 
        be appropriate for the proper monitoring of the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
        (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this subsection 
    limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to receive funds 
    made available under titles I, II, III, and VI of this Act and 
    section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if the entity or 
    person is prevented, in whole or in part, from complying with 
    paragraph (3) because a Federal court issues a final order in which 
    the court finds that a requirement or the implementation of 
    paragraph (3) is unconstitutional.
        (8) Sense of congress on prompt payment of dbe 
    subcontractors.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (A) the Secretary should take additional steps to ensure 
        that recipients comply with section 26.29 of title 49, Code of 
        Federal Regulations (the disadvantaged business enterprises 
        prompt payment rule), or any corresponding regulation, in 
        awarding federally funded transportation contracts under laws 
        and regulations administered by the Secretary; and
            (B) such additional steps should include increasing the 
        Department's ability to track and keep records of complaints 
        and to make that information publicly available.

            (A) in many States, the Native American population is 
        disproportionately represented in fatalities and crash 
        statistics;
            (B) improved crash reporting by tribal law enforcement 
        agencies would facilitate safety planning and would enable 
        Indian tribes to apply more successfully for State and Federal 
        funds for safety improvements;
            (C) the causes of underreporting of crashes on Indian 
        reservations include--

                    (I) staffing shortages and turnover; and
                    (II) lack of equipment, software, and training; and

                (ii) lack of standardization in crash reporting forms 
            and protocols; and
            (D) without more accurate reporting of crashes on Indian 
        reservations, it is difficult or impossible to fully understand 
        the nature of the problem and develop appropriate 
        countermeasures, which may include effective transportation 
        safety planning and programs aimed at--
                (i) driving under the influence (DUI) prevention;

        fund or reserve, or new capital.

    described in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted to ensure that, for 
    each State, the amount shall not be less than 97 percent of the 
    average amount of funding received or other equitable amounts in 
    fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for--
            (A) motor carrier safety assistance program funds awarded 
        to the State under section 31102 of title 49, United States 
        Code;
            (B) border enforcement grants awarded to the State under

SEC. 5107. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT CALCULATION.
    (a) Before New Allocation Formula.--
        (1) Fiscal year 2017.--If a new allocation formula for the 
    motor carrier safety assistance program has not been established 
    under this subtitle for fiscal year 2017, the Secretary shall 
    calculate for fiscal year 2017 the maintenance of effort baseline 
    required under section 31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as 
    amended by this subtitle, by averaging the expenditures for fiscal 
    years 2004 and 2005 required by section 31102(b)(4) of title 49, 
    United States Code, as that section was in effect on the day before 
    the date of enactment of this Act.
        (2) Subsequent fiscal years.--The Secretary may use the 
    methodology for calculating the maintenance of effort baseline 
    specified in paragraph (1) for fiscal year 2018 and subsequent 
    fiscal years if a new allocation formula for the motor carrier 
    safety assistance program has not been established for that fiscal 
    year.
    (b) Beginning With New Allocation Formation.--
        (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)(B), 
    beginning on the date that a new allocation formula for the motor 
    carrier safety assistance program is established under this 
    subtitle, upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive or 
    modify the baseline maintenance of effort required of the State by 
    section 31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as amended by 
    this subtitle, for the purpose of establishing a new baseline 
    maintenance of effort if the Secretary determines that a waiver or 
    modification--
            (A) is equitable due to reasonable circumstances;
            (B) will ensure the continuation of commercial motor 
        vehicle enforcement activities in the State; and
            (C) is necessary to ensure that the total amount of State 
        maintenance of effort and matching expenditures required under 
        sections 31102 and 31104 of title 49, United States Code, as 
        amended by this subtitle, does not exceed a sum greater than 
        the average of the total amount of State maintenance of effort 
        and matching expenditures required under those sections for the 
        3 fiscal years prior to the date of enactment of this Act.
        (2) Adjustment methodology.--If requested by a State, the 
    Secretary may modify the maintenance of effort baseline referred to 
    in paragraph (1) for the State according to the following 
    methodology:
            (A) The Secretary shall establish the maintenance of effort 
        baseline for the State using the average baseline of fiscal 
        years 2004 and 2005, as required by section 31102(b)(4) of 
        title 49, United States Code, as that section was in effect on 
        the day before the date of enactment of this Act.
            (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average required 
        match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle safety agency 
        for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for motor carrier safety 
        assistance grants established at 20 percent by section 31103 of 
        title 49, United States Code, as that section was in effect on 
        the day before the date of enactment of this Act.
            (C) The Secretary shall calculate the estimated match 
        required under section 31104(b) of title 49, United States 
        Code, as amended by this subtitle.
            (D) The Secretary shall subtract the amount in subparagraph 
        (B) from the amount in subparagraph (C) and--
                (i) if the number is greater than 0, the Secretary 
            shall subtract the number from the amount in subparagraph 
            (A); or
                (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, the Secretary 
            shall calculate the maintenance of effort using the 
            methodology in subparagraph (A).
        (3) Maintenance of effort amount.--
            (A) In general.--The Secretary shall use the amount 
        calculated under paragraph (2) as the baseline maintenance of 
        effort required under section 31102(f) of title 49, United 
        States Code, as amended by this subtitle.
            (B) Deadline.--If a State does not request a waiver or 
        modification under this subsection before September 30 during 
        the first fiscal year that the Secretary implements a new 
        allocation formula for the motor carrier safety assistance 
        program under this subtitle, the Secretary shall calculate the 
        maintenance of effort using the methodology described in 
        paragraph (2)(A).
        (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of effort 
    calculated under this section is the amount required under section 
    31102(f) of title 49, United States Code, as amended by this 
    subtitle.
    (c) Termination of Effectiveness.--The authority of the Secretary 
under this section shall terminate effective on the date that a new 
maintenance of effort baseline is calculated based on a new allocation 
formula for the motor carrier safety assistance program implemented 
under section 31102 of title 49, United States Code.

                control of Federal, State, local, or tribal 
                governments, may not extend the permitting timetable 
                for a period of time greater than half of the amount of 
                time from the establishment of the permitting timetable 
                under subparagraph (A) to the last final completion 
                date originally established under subparagraph (A).
                    (II) Additional extensions.--The Director of the

                permitting timetable beyond the limit prescribed by 
                subclause (I). In such a case, the Director of the 
                Office of Management and Budget shall transmit, not

                Congress with specificity why the original permitting 
                timetable and the modifications authorized by the 
                Executive Director failed to be adequate. The lead or 
                facilitating agency, as applicable, shall transmit to 
                Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and 
                Budget, and the Executive Director a supplemental 
                report on progress toward the final completion date 
                each year thereafter, until the permit review is 
                completed or the project sponsor withdraws its notice 
                or application or other request to which this title 
                applies under section 41010.

                of a permitting timetable.

            (E) Consistency with other time periods.--A permitting 
        timetable established under subparagraph (A) shall be 
        consistent with any other relevant time periods established 
        under Federal law and shall not prevent any cooperating or 
        participating agency from discharging any obligation under 
        Federal law in connection with the project.

    cooperating agencies with jurisdiction under Federal law and at the 
    discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a 
    project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level 
    of detail than other alternatives to facilitate the development of 
    mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable 
    laws if the lead agency determines that the development of the 
    higher level of detail will not prevent--
            (A) the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to 
        whether to accept another alternative that is being considered 
        in the environmental review; and
            (B) the public from commenting on the preferred and other

    a person has violated the terms of an authorization.
    (b) Preliminary Injunctive Relief.--In addition to considering any 
other applicable equitable factors, in any action seeking a temporary
