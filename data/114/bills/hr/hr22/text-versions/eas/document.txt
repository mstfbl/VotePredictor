                    (C) not be transferable.
    (c) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers 
                continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- 
                and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
                federally assisted surface transportation markets 
                across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.

                        concern'' does not include any concern or group

                        economically disadvantaged individual or

                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations

            (5) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish

                    (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall include, with

                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under divisions A and B of this 
        Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if the 
        individual or entity is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
        complying with paragraph (2) because a Federal court issues a 
        final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the 
        implementation of paragraph (2) is unconstitutional.
    (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 1101(b) of MAP-21 (Public Law 
112-141; 126 Stat. 414) is repealed.

    (d) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (c), the Secretary shall, after August 1 of each of fiscal

            (2) Exception.--Obligation authority made available under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) remain available for a period of 4 fiscal 
                years; and
                    (B) be in addition to the amount of any limitation 
                imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and 
                highway safety construction programs for future fiscal 
                years.

            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        distribution of obligation authority under subsection (c) for 
        each of fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the Secretary shall 
        distribute to the States any funds (excluding funds authorized 
        for the program under section 202 of title 23, United States 
        Code) that--
                    (A) are authorized to be appropriated for the 
                fiscal year for Federal-aid highway programs; and
                    (B) the Secretary determines will not be allocated 
                to the States (or will not be apportioned to the States 
                under section 204 of title 23, United States Code), and 
                will not be available for obligation, for the fiscal 
                year because of the imposition of any obligation 
                limitation for the fiscal year.
            (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 
        in the same proportion as the distribution of obligation

        paragraph (1) shall be available for any purpose described in

        project under title 23, United States Code, before receiving 
        project authorization from the State, in the case of a 
        subrecipient, and the Secretary to proceed with the project;

            (2) request reimbursement of applicable Federal funds after 
        the project authorization is received.
    (c) Eligibility.--The Secretary may reimburse preliminary 
engineering costs incurred by a recipient or subrecipient under 
subsection (b)--
            (1) if the costs meet all applicable requirements under 
        title 23, United States Code, at the time the costs are 
        incurred and the Secretary concurs that the requirements have 
        been met;

        under this section to advance a project beyond preliminary 
        engineering prior to the completion of the environmental review 
        process;
            (2) waives the applicability of Federal requirements to a 
        project other than the reimbursement of preliminary engineering 
        costs incurred prior to an authorization to proceed in 
        accordance with this section; or
            (3) guarantees Federal funding of the project or the

SEC. 12003. FUTURE INTERSTATE STUDY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) a well-developed system of transportation 
        infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, health, 
        and welfare of the people of the United States;
            (2) the 47,000-mile national Interstate System is the 
        backbone to that transportation infrastructure system; and
            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act--
                    (A) many segments of the approximately 60-year-old 
                Interstate System are well beyond the 50-year design 
                life of the System and yet these aging facilities are 
                central to the transportation infrastructure system, 
                carrying 25 percent of the vehicle traffic of the 
                United States on just 1 percent of the total public 
                roadway mileage;
                    (B) the need for ongoing maintenance, preservation, 
                and reconstruction of the Interstate System has grown 
                due to increasing and changing travel demands; and
                    (C) simple maintenance of the current condition and 
                configuration of the Interstate System is insufficient 
                for the System to fully serve the transportation needs 
                of the United States for the next 50 years.
    (b) Future Interstate System Study.--Not later than 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into an 
agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National 
Academies to conduct a study on the actions needed to upgrade and 
restore the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and 
Defense Highways to its role as a premier system network that meets the 
growing and shifting demands of the 21st century and for the next 50 
years (referred to in this section as the ``study'').
    (c) Methodologies.--In conducting the study, the Transportation 
Research Board shall build on the methodologies examined and 
recommended in the report prepared for the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials entitled ``National 
Cooperative Highway Research Program Project 20-24(79): Specifications 
for a National Study of the Future 3R, 4R, and Capacity Needs of the 
Interstate System'' and dated December 2013.
    (d) Recommendations.--The study--
            (1) shall include specific recommendations regarding the 
        features, standards, capacity needs, application of 
        technologies, and intergovernmental roles to upgrade the 
        Interstate System, including any revisions to law (including 
        regulations) that the Transportation Research Board determines 
        appropriate to achieve the goals; and
            (2) is encouraged to build on the robust institutional 
        knowledge in the highway industry in applying the techniques 
        involved in implementing the study.
    (e) Considerations.--In carrying out the study, the Transportation 
Research Board shall determine the need for reconstruction and 
improvement of the Interstate System by considering--
            (1) future demands on transportation infrastructure 
        determined for national planning purposes, including commercial 
        and private traffic flows to serve future economic activity and 
        growth;
            (2) the expected condition of the current Interstate System 
        over the next 50 years, including long-term deterioration and 
        reconstruction needs;
            (3) those National Highway System routes that should be 
        added to the existing Interstate System to more efficiently 
        serve national traffic flows;
            (4) features that would take advantage of technological 
        capabilities to address modern standards of construction, 
        maintenance, and operations, for purposes of safety, and system 
        management, taking into further consideration system 
        performance and cost; and
            (5) the resources necessary to maintain and improve the 
        Interstate System, including the resources required to upgrade 
        those National Highway System routes identified in paragraph 
        (3) to Interstate standards.
    (f) Consultation.--In carrying out the study, the Transportation 
Research Board--
            (1) shall convene and consult with a panel of national 
        experts including current and future owners, operators, and 
        users of the Interstate System and private sector stakeholders;

SEC. 31302. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) America's ports play a critical role in the Nation's 
        transportation supply chain network.
            (2) Reliable and efficient movement of goods through the 
        Nation's ports ensures that American goods are available to 
        customers throughout the world.
            (3) Breakdowns in the transportation supply chain network, 
        particularly at the Nation's ports, can result in tremendous 
        economic losses for agriculture, businesses, and retailers that 
        rely on timely shipments.
            (4) A clear understanding of terminal and port productivity 
        and throughput should help--
                    (A) to identify freight bottlenecks;
                    (B) to indicate performance and trends over time;

                (Public Law 112-141).
                    (B) The Secretary shall calculate the average 
                required match by a lead State commercial motor vehicle 
                safety agency for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 for 
                motor carrier safety assistance grants established at 
                20 percent by section 31103 of title 49, United States 
                Code, as that section was in effect on the day before 
                the date of enactment of this Act.

                        the Secretary shall subtract the number from 
                        the amount in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) if the number is not greater than 0, 
                        then the Secretary shall calculate the 
                        maintenance of effort using the methodology in 
                        subparagraph (A).

                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall use the amount 
                calculated in paragraph (2) as the baseline maintenance 
                of effort required in section 31102(f) of title 49, 
                United States Code, as amended by section 32502 of this 
                Act.

                implements the new allocation formula under section 
                32508, the Secretary shall calculate the maintenance of 
                effort using the methodology in paragraph (2)(A) of 
                this subsection.
            (4) Maintenance of effort described.--The maintenance of 
        effort calculated under this section is the amount required

entity's lines required to have operations governed by a positive train 
control system, any railroad carrier or other entity shall not be 
subject to the operational restrictions set forth in subpart I of part 
236 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, that would otherwise 
apply in the event of a positive train control system component 
failure.

                (A) may serve as the documentation required for an 
                environmental review or a supplemental environmental 
                review required to be prepared by a lead agency under 
                NEPA.

                incorporation--
                            (i) a significant change has been made to 
                        the covered project that is relevant for 
                        purposes of environmental review of the 
                        project; or

                in collaboration with each cooperating agency at 
                appropriate times during the environmental review, the 
                methodologies to be used and the level of detail 
                required in the analysis of each alternative for a 
                covered project.
                    (B) Environmental review.--A cooperating agency 
                shall use the methodologies referred to in subparagraph

            (4) Preferred alternative.--With the concurrence of the 
        cooperating agencies with jurisdiction under Federal law and at 
        the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative 
        for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a 
        higher level of detail than other alternatives to facilitate 
        the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance 
        with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that 
        the development of the higher level of detail will not 
        prevent--
                    (A) the lead agency from making an impartial 
                decision as to whether to accept another alternative 
                that is being considered in the environmental review; 
                and

                    (A) the lead agency, the project sponsor, and any 
                cooperating agency agree to a longer deadline; or
                    (B) the lead agency, in consultation with each 
                cooperating agency, extends the deadline for good 
                cause.

            (2) Lead agency responsibilities.--
                    (A) In general.--The lead agency shall make

    (a) Limitations on Claims.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, a claim arising under Federal law seeking judicial review 
        of any authorization issued by a Federal agency for a covered

                    (A) the action is filed not later than 2 years 
                after the date of publication in the Federal Register 
                of the final record of decision or approval or denial

                Federal law under which judicial review is allowed; and
                    (B) in the case of an action pertaining to an 
                environmental review conducted under NEPA--

                        submitted a comment during the environmental 
                        review or a party that lacked a reasonable 
                        opportunity to submit a comment; and
                            (ii) a party filed a sufficiently detailed 
                        comment so as to put the lead agency on notice

                regulations implementing NEPA.
                    (B) Separate action.--If Federal law requires the 
                preparation of a supplemental environmental impact 
                statement or other supplemental environmental document, 
                the preparation of such document shall be considered a 
                separate final agency action and the deadline for 
                filing a claim for judicial review of the agency action 
                shall be 2 years after the date on which a notice 
                announcing the final agency action is published in the 
                Federal Register, unless a shorter time is specified in 
                the Federal law under which judicial review is allowed.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection

    (b) Preliminary Injunctive Relief.--In addition to considering any 
other applicable equitable factors, in any action seeking a temporary 
restraining order or preliminary injunction against an agency or a 
project sponsor in connection with review or authorization of a covered 
project, the court shall--
            (1) consider the effects on public health, safety, and the 
        environment, the potential for significant job losses, and 
        other economic harm resulting from an order or injunction; and

in this title affects the reviewability of any final Federal agency 
action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

        affects the responsibility of any Federal officer to comply

interferes with--
            (1) any practice of seeking, considering, or responding to 
        public comment; or
            (2) any power, jurisdiction, responsibility, or authority 
        that a Federal, State, or local governmental agency,

        aggregate amount of fees collected for a fiscal year is 
        estimated not to exceed 20 percent of the total estimated costs 
        for the fiscal year for the resources allocated for the conduct
