                        through the Chief of the Natural Resources 
                        Conservation Service, shall ensure the 
                        completion of a wetland delineation, 
                        determination, or certification by the date 
                        that is 60 days after the date on which a 
                        person subject to this subtitle requests the 
                        delineation, determination, or certification.
                            ``(ii) Effect of delay.--If a wetland 
                        delineation, determination, or certification is 
                        not completed by the date described in clause 
                        (i), upon completion of the wetland 
                        delineation, determination, or certification, 
                        the Secretary shall provide for a reasonable 
                        transition period for coming into compliance 
                        with the wetland delineation, determination, or 
                        certification, as necessary, and a person shall 
                        not become ineligible under section 1221 for 
                        program loans or payments as a result of 
                        actions taken, between the date described in 
                        clause (i) and the date on which such 
                        transition period ends, in violation of the 
                        wetland delineation, determination, or 
                        certification.
                    ``(B) Final agency action.--A wetland delineation, 
                determination, or certification made by the Secretary 
                shall be considered a final agency action subject to 
                judicial review, and a person challenging a wetland 
                delineation, determination, or certification shall not 
                be required to exhaust all administrative remedies 
                prior to bringing a suit in Federal court.
                    ``(C) Duty to disclose.--In the case of a wetland 
                delineation, determination, or certification for which 
                there exists a dispute, the Secretary shall make 
                available a copy of the agency record, to a person 
                involved in the dispute who requests such a copy, not 
                later than 30 days after the date on which the person 
                makes the request.
                    ``(D) Burden of proof.--In the case of a wetland 
                delineation, determination, or certification for which 
                there exists a dispute, the Secretary shall bear the 
                burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
                    ``(E) Effect on existing process.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to prohibit a person 
                challenging a wetland delineation, determination, or 
                certification from using the administrative appeal 
                process in place before the date of enactment of this 
                paragraph.''.

                    ``(A) in the preparation and application of a 
                conservation plan under subtitle B or similar plan 
                required as a condition for assistance from the 
                Department of Agriculture; and
                    ``(B) in the preparation of a wetland delineation 
                or determination to submit to the Secretary under 
                section 1222.
            ``(2) Rejection.--If the Secretary rejects a technical 
        determination made by an approved source pursuant to paragraph 
        (1)(A), or a wetland delineation or determination made by an 
        approved source pursuant to paragraph (1)(B), the basis of the 
        Secretary's rejection must be supported by documented 
        evidence.''.
