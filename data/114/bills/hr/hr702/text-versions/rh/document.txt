                                 A BILL


 
           To adapt to changing crude oil market conditions.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy 
        production, establishing the United States as the world's 
        leading oil producer;
            (2) the United States upholds a commitment to free trade 
        and open markets and has consistently opposed attempts by other 
        nations to restrict the free flow of energy; and
            (3) the United States should remove all restrictions on the 
        export of crude oil, which will provide domestic economic 
        benefits, enhanced energy security, and flexibility in foreign 
        diplomacy.

SEC. 2. REPEAL.

    Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that 
Act are repealed.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the 
efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, 
and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official 
of the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on 
the export of crude oil.

SEC. 4. STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

    Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study and transmit to the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate 
recommendations on the appropriate size, composition, and purpose of 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE.

    Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the President under the 
Constitution, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), or part B of title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
(42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit exports.
