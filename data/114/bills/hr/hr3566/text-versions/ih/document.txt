              POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION BENEFITS.

    ``(a) In General.--An alien who is not in a lawful immigration 
status in the United States shall not be eligible for any postsecondary

    ``(b) Enforcement Through Civil Action.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any citizen or national of the United 
        States who is enrolled at a postsecondary educational 
        institution in the United States that is alleged to have 
        violated subsection (a) may petition the district court of the 
        United States in which such institution is located to enforce 
        the restriction described in such subsection by commencing a 
        civil action, on his or her own behalf, in such court against 
        any State official that oversees such institution.
            ``(2) Relief.--If the plaintiff in a civil action commenced 
        under paragraph (1) proves by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that the postsecondary educational institution in which the 
        plaintiff was enrolled violated subsection (a), the court 
        shall--
                    ``(A) provide all appropriate relief to the 
                plaintiff, including damages equal to the monetary 
                value of any benefit provided to an alien who is not in 
                a lawful immigration status in the United States that 
                was denied to the plaintiff; and
                    ``(B) award attorneys' fees and court costs to the 
                plaintiff.''.
