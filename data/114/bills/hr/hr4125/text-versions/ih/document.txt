 To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study on the 
feasibility of the Secretary entering into public-private partnerships 
  to improve the access of veterans to medical facilities in densely 
              populated communities and rural communities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. STUDY ON FEASIBILITY OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO 
              IMPROVE ACCESS OF VETERANS TO MEDICAL FACILITIES IN 
              DENSELY POPULATED COMMUNITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES.

    (a) Study.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall conduct a study 
on the feasibility of the Secretary entering into covered public-
private partnerships to improve the access of veterans to medical 
facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs in densely populated 
communities and rural communities. Such study shall include the 
following:
            (1) An evaluation of the ability of veterans to access 
        medical facilities of the Department in densely populated 
        communities and rural communities, including the identification 
        of issues that diminish such access in such communities, 
        including with respect to such diminished access that affects 
        only certain populations of veterans or certain kinds of health 
        care.
            (2) An evaluation of whether the requirement for 
        Congressional approval for major medical facility leases under 
        section 8104 of title 38, United States Code, delays such 
        access.
            (3) An evaluation of how covered public-private 
        partnerships may improve the ability of veterans to access 
        medical facilities of the Department in densely populated 
        communities and rural communities.
            (4) An evaluation of whether underused medical facilities 
        of the Department meet building codes.
            (5) Recommendations by the Secretary on how to improve such 
        access, including with respect to any regulatory or legislative 
        actions required to make such improvements.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Senate a 
report containing the study under subsection (a).
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``covered public-private partnerships'' means 
        leases or other agreements entered into by the Secretary with 
        non-Department facilities under which the Secretary will 
        establish a medical facility of the Department in the unused or 
        underused space of the non-Department facility.
            (2) The term ``densely populated communities'' means 
        communities that are in an urbanized area or an urban cluster, 
        as determined by the Bureau of the Census.
            (3) The term ``non-Department facilities'' has the meaning 
        given that term in section 1701 of title 38, United States 
        Code.
            (4) The term ``rural communities'' means the rural areas 
        under the jurisdiction of the Office of Rural Health of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs established by section 7308 of 
        title 38, United States Code.
