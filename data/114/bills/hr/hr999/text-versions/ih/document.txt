   To direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National 
Academy of Sciences to study the vehicle handling requirements proposed 
by the Commission for recreational off-highway vehicles and to prohibit 
   the adoption of any such requirements until the completion of the 
                                 study.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``ROV In-Depth Examination Act''.

SEC. 2. RECREATIONAL OFF-HIGHWAY VEHICLE STANDARDS STUDY.

    (a) No Mandatory Standards Regarding Performance or Configuration 
of ROVs.--
            (1) In general.--The Consumer Product Safety Commission 
        shall have no authority to establish any standards concerning 
        the performance or configuration of recreational off-highway 
        vehicles until after the completion of the study required by 
        subsection (b). This prohibition includes a prohibition on the 
        exercise of any authority pursuant to section 27(e) of the 
        Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2076(e)) to require ROV 
        manufacturers to provide performance and technical data to 
        prospective purchasers and to the first purchaser of an ROV for 
        purposes other than resale.
            (2) Voluntary standards.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as suggesting that ROVs shall not be manufactured in 
        compliance with applicable voluntary standards.
    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall contract with the 
        National Academy of Sciences to determine--
                    (A) the technical validity of the lateral stability 
                and vehicle handling requirements proposed by the 
                Commission in a notice of proposed rulemaking published 
                in the Federal Register November 19, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 
                68964), for purposes of reducing the risk of ROV 
                rollovers in the off-road environment, including the 
                repeatability and reproducibility of testing for 
                compliance with such requirements;
                    (B) the number of ROV rollovers that would be 
                prevented if the proposed requirements were adopted;
                    (C) whether there is a technical basis for the 
                proposal to provide information on a point-of-sale 
                hangtag about a vehicle's rollover resistance on a 
                progressive scale; and
                    (D) the effect on the utility of ROVs used by the 
                Armed Forces if the proposed requirements were adopted.
            (2) Consultation and deadline for report.--The National 
        Academy of Sciences shall consult with the National Highway 
        Traffic Safety Administration and the Department of Defense in 
        carrying out the study required by this subsection. The 
        National Academy of Sciences shall complete and transmit to the 
        Commission a report containing the findings of the study not 
        later than two years after the date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Report to congress.--Within five days of receiving the 
        report described in paragraph (2) from the National Academy of 
        Sciences, the Commission shall transmit the report, along with 
        any comments of the Commission, to the Committee on Energy and 
        Commerce of the House of Representatives and to the Committee 
        on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate.
            (4) Consideration.--The Commission shall consider the 
        results of the study in any subsequent rulemaking regarding the 
        performance or configuration of ROVs, or the provision of 
        point-of-sale information regarding ROV performance.
    (c) Definitions.--As used in this section:
