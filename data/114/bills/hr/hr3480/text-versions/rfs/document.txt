    (b) Boundary Expansion.--
            (1) In general.--The boundary of the Fort Frederica 
        National Monument in the State of Georgia is modified to

        be construed to create buffer zones outside of the Monument. 
        That activities or uses can be seen, heard, or detected from 
        areas within the Fort Frederica National Monument shall not 
        preclude, limit, control, regulate, or determine the conduct or
