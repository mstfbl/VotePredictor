coverage and provides in a secondary State covered medical services 
that are within the scope of practice of such professional in the

such an athlete or athletic team) pursuant to an agreement described in 
subsection (b)(4) with respect to such athlete or athletic team--
            (1) such medical professional liability insurance coverage 
        shall cover (subject to any related premium adjustments) such 
        professional with respect to such covered medical services 
        provided by the professional in the secondary State to such an 
        individual or team as if such services were provided by such 
        professional in the primary State to such an individual or 
        team; and
            (2) to the extent such professional is licensed under the 
        requirements of the primary State to provide such services to 
        such an individual or team, the professional shall be treated 
        as satisfying any licensure requirements of the secondary State 
        to provide such services to such an individual or team.
