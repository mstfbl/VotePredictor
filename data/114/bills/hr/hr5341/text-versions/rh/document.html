    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. COMPUTATION OF BASIC ANNUITY FOR CERTAIN AIR TRAFFIC 
              CONTROLLERS.

    (a) In General.--Section 8415(f) of title 5, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(f) The annuity of an air traffic controller or former air 
traffic controller retiring under section 8412(a) is computed under 
subsection (a), except that if the individual has at least 5 years of 
service in any combination as--
            ``(1) an air traffic controller as defined by section 
        2109(1)(A)(i);
            ``(2) a first level supervisor of an air traffic controller 
        as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i); or
            ``(3) a second level supervisor of an air traffic 
        controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i);
so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to such type of 
service shall be computed by multiplying 1\7/10\ percent of the 
individual's average pay by the years of such service.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be 
deemed to be effective on December 12, 2003.
    (c) Procedures Required.--The Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management shall establish such procedures as are necessary to provide 
for--
            (1) notification to each annuitant affected by the 
        amendments made by this section;
            (2) recalculation of the benefits of affected annuitants;
            (3) an adjustment to applicable monthly benefit amounts 
        pursuant to such recalculation, to begin as soon as is 
        practicable; and
            (4) a lump sum payment to each affected annuitant equal to 
        the additional total benefit amount that such annuitant would 
        have received had the amendment made by subsection (a) been in 
        effect on December 12, 2003.
