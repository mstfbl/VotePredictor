SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has a unique, legally affirmed 
        government-to-government relationship with Indian tribal 
        governments as set forth in the Constitution of the United 
        States, treaties, statutes, Executive orders, and court 
        decisions;
            (2) the United States recognizes the right of Indian tribes 
        to self-government and supports tribal sovereignty and self-
        determination;
            (3) the United States has enacted numerous statutes and 
        promulgated numerous regulations that establish and define a 
        trust relationship with Indian tribes;
            (4) the United States has a responsibility to consult with 
        Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis when 
        formulating policies and undertaking activities that will have 
        impacts on tribal lands and interests;
            (5) procedures for such consultation should be designed and 
        structured to give Indian tribes opportunities to provide 
        meaningful, informed input throughout the development and 
        decisionmaking processes;
            (6) building institutional knowledge and capacity for 
        effective consultation fosters greater efficiency and benefits 
        for future projects;
            (7) the consultation process should be institutionalized 
        according to best practices that are designed and administered 
        by the agency and that fulfill the legal requirements mandated 
        by this Act;
            (8) consulting with Indian tribes during the formulation of 
        long-term management plans reduces the likelihood of project 
        delays and increases the efficiency of project implementations; 
        and
            (9) effective consultation demands ongoing, respectful 
        communication between agencies and Indian tribes.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to establish and support a process of regular, 
        meaningful consultation and collaboration with Indian tribes in 
        the development of Federal policies and the initiation of 
        Federal activities that impact tribal lands and interests;
            (2) to strengthen the United States government-to-
        government relationships with Indian tribes;
            (3) to establish minimum standard procedures to ensure the 
        above goals are achieved; and
            (4) to recognize tribal regulatory authority and 
        jurisdiction generally, and specifically through the waiver 
        process.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) consultation constitutes more than simply notifying an 
        Indian tribe about a planned undertaking;
            (2) effective, meaningful consultation requires a two-way 
        exchange of information, a willingness to listen, an attempt to 
        understand and genuinely consider each other's opinions, 
        beliefs, and desired outcomes, and a seeking of agreement on 
        how to proceed concerning the issues at hand; and
            (3) consultation can be considered effective and meaningful 
        when each party demonstrates a genuine commitment to learn, 
        acknowledge, and respect the positions, perspectives, and 
        concerns of the other parties.

                    TITLE I--CONSULTATION PROCEDURE

SEC. 101. REQUIREMENT FOR CONSULTATION.

    (a) Scope.--Agencies shall have an accountable process to ensure 
meaningful and timely input by Indian tribes and tribal officials prior 
to undertaking any activity that may have substantial direct impacts on 
the lands or interests of one or more Indian tribes, on the 
relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on 
the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian tribes. Consultation with Indian tribes shall 
occur for all activities that would affect any part of any Federal land 
that shares a border with Indian country as defined in section 1151 of 
title 18, United States Code, but is not limited to activities on such 
lands.
    (b) Multi-Agency Activities.--In the case of agency-drafted 
proposed legislation, the drafting agency, and any other agency that 
will be implementing the legislation, shall each be considered involved 
in the activity. If more than one agency is involved in an activity, 
some or all of the agencies may designate a lead agency, which shall 
fulfill their collective consultation responsibilities. Those agencies 
that do not designate a lead agency shall remain individually 
responsible for their consultation responsibilities under this Act.
    (c) Limitation.--Nothing in this Act shall exempt an agency from 
additional consultation required under any other law or from taking any 
other consultative actions as required by any other law or agency 
prerogative in addition to those required by this Act. Nor does it 
preclude an agency from additional consultation that complies with 
agency regulations for consultation, advances agency consultation 
practices, or supports agency efforts to build or strengthen 
government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes.
    (d) Temporary Waiver.--
            (1) In general.--The agency may temporarily waive the 
        requirements of this title in all or any portion of any 
        emergency area during all or any portion of an emergency 
        period.
            (2) Duration of waiver.--A temporary waiver under this 
        subsection shall end upon the termination of the applicable 
        emergency period.
            (3) Definitions.--For the purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) the term ``emergency area'' means a 
                geographical area in which there exists an emergency or 
                disaster declared by the President pursuant to the 
                National Emergencies Act (Public Law 94-412) or the 
                Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
                Assistance Act (Public Law 93-288); and
                    (B) the term ``emergency period'' means the period 
                during which there exists an emergency or disaster 
                declared by the President pursuant to the National 
                Emergencies Act (Public Law 94-412) or the Robert T. 
                Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
                (Public Law 93-288).

SEC. 102. TIMING.

    Consultation under sections 103 and 104 shall be completed before 
any Federal funds are expended for the activity and before the issuance 
of any license other than for funding nondestructive project planning 
activities.

SEC. 103. SCOPING STAGE CONSULTATION.

    (a) Planning Document.--As early as possible in the planning stage 
of an activity, the agency shall compile a draft of the scope of the 
project, including any geographic areas important to Indian tribes that 
might be affected and any other anticipated tribal impacts. The agency 
shall make a good faith effort to include areas that contain sites 
important to Indian tribes whether or not such sites are explicitly 
known to the agency.
    (b) Initial Consultation Contact.--The agency--
            (1) shall send, via United States mail and, if possible, 
        email, a copy of the planning document and a letter requesting 
        consultation meetings to the relevant tribal government 
        officials, including the tribal leader and all members of any 
        elected tribal governing body, relevant tribal governmental 
        agencies (including the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer or 
        cultural resource manager), and relevant nontribal stakeholders 
        (including the State Historic Preservation Officer and local 
        governments that have jurisdiction on any affected land via 
        agreement with the agency);
            (2) at the request of an affected Indian tribe, shall send, 
        via United States mail and, if possible, email, a copy of the 
        planning document and a letter requesting consultation meetings 
        to nongovernmental tribal stakeholders, such as elders councils 
        and religious leaders;
            (3) shall not request consultation with nongovernmental 
        tribal stakeholders without the written consent of the affected 
        Indian tribe; and
            (4) shall follow up with phone calls to confirm receipt of 
        the documents by all intended recipients.
    (c) Consultation Meeting Arrangements.--The agency shall negotiate 
with the affected Indian tribes to determine the time, place, agenda, 
travel funds, facilitator, format, and goals of a consultation meeting. 
The agency shall keep thorough documentation of all steps taken to 
contact and engage the affected Indian tribes in consultation. If, 
after a good faith effort, the agency fails to engage the affected 
Indian tribes, it may terminate its scoping stage consultation efforts 
by providing all consultation partners with a written notification and 
explanation for its decision, signed by the head of the agency, and 
proceed to the decision stage procedures described in section 104.
    (d) Scoping Stage Consultation Meeting.--A scoping stage 
consultation meeting shall begin with confirmation of the format, 
facilitator, and agenda, with adequate time scheduled for introductions 
and for interaction throughout the meeting among participants. Whenever 
possible, tribal stakeholders shall be brought into the ongoing 
planning process directly by forming ad hoc workgroups (including 
tribal leaders or their designees) and, if appropriate, initiating a 
process for consensual development of regulations, such as negotiated 
rulemaking. Scoping stage consultation meeting shall conclude with 
planning for the next meeting, if necessary.
    (e) Termination of Scoping Stage Consultation With a Memorandum of 
Agreement.--
            (1) Termination.--Except as provided by subsection (c), 
        scoping stage consultation shall terminate upon the execution 
        of a memorandum of agreement signed by the head of the agency 
        and the affected Indian tribal governments.
            (2) Signatories.--The affected Indian tribal governments 
        and the agency may jointly invite additional parties to be 
        signatories of the memorandum of agreement. The signatories 
        have sole authority to execute, amend, or terminate the 
        memorandum of agreement. If any signatory determines that the 
        terms of the memorandum of agreement cannot be or are not being 
        carried out, the signatories shall consult to seek amendment of 
        the memorandum of agreement. If the memorandum of agreement is 
        not amended, any signatory may terminate the agreement, with 
        the option to return to scoping stage consultation. The agency 
        shall provide all nonsignatory consulting partners with the 
        opportunity to submit a written statement, explanation, or 
        comment on the consultation proceedings that shall become part 
        of the agency's official consultation record.
            (3) MOA.--The memorandum of agreement--
                    (A) may address multiple activities if the 
                activities are similar and repetitive or are multi-
                State or regional in scope, or where routine management 
                activities are undertaken at Federal installations, 
                facilities, or other land management units;
                    (B) may establish standard processes for certain 
                categories of activities determined through 
                consultation and defined in the memorandum of 
                agreement;
                    (C) shall include a provision for monitoring and 
                reporting on its implementation;
                    (D) shall include provisions for termination or 
                reconsideration if the activity has not been completed 
                within a specified time; and
                    (E) shall include provisions to address new 
                discoveries, which may include halting the activity and 
                returning to scoping stage consultation.
    (f) Termination of Scoping Stage Consultation Without a Memorandum 
of Agreement.--The agency shall make a good faith effort through 
sustained interaction and collaboration to reach a consensus resulting 
in a memorandum of agreement. If, after a good faith effort, the agency 
determines that further consultation will not be productive, it may 
terminate consultation by providing all consultation partners with a 
written notification and explanation for its decision, signed by the 
head of the agency, and proceed to the decision stage procedures 
described in section 104. The affected Indian tribal governments may at 
any point decide to terminate consultation. In such case, the agency 
shall provide the affected Indian tribal governments with the 
opportunity to submit a written statement, explanation, or comment on 
the consultation proceedings that will become part of the agency's 
official consultation record.

SEC. 104. DECISION STAGE PROCEDURES.

    (a) Proposal Document.--The agency shall compile a document 
consisting of the plan for the activity, its anticipated tribal 
impacts, any memorandum of agreement, and any written statements made 
by consulting partners during the scoping stage as described in section 
103. The agency shall include sufficient supporting documentation to 
the extent permitted by law and within available funds to enable any 
reviewing parties to understand its basis. The agency may use 
documentation prepared to comply with other laws to fulfill the 
requirements of this provision to the extent that such documentation is 
sufficiently pertinent to and focused on the relevant issues as to 
allow reasonable ease of review. The agency shall mail and, if 
possible, email a copy of the Proposal Document to all affected Indian 
tribal governments, including those that withdrew from the process. At 
a minimum, the document shall go to the tribal leader and all members 
of any elected tribal governing body. The agency shall follow up to 
confirm receipt of the document. After these steps have been completed, 
the Proposal Document shall be published in the Federal Register, 
subject to the provisions of section 107.
    (b) Public Comment Period.--The agency shall provide a period of 
not less than 90 days after publication in the Federal Register for 
comments on the Proposal Document. A 30-day extension shall be granted 
upon request by any member of any of the affected Indian tribal 
governing bodies.
    (c) Preliminary Decision.--After expiration of the comment period, 
the agency shall prepare a preliminary decision letter, signed by the 
head of the agency. The letter shall state the decision to proceed or 
not proceed with the activity, the decision's rationale, any changes in 
the proposal made in response to comments, and any points where the 
decision conflicts with the expressed requests of any of the affected 
Indian tribes. It shall particularly address why the decision was made 
to disregard any such requests. The agency shall mail and, if possible, 
email a copy of the letter to all affected Indian tribal governments, 
including those that withdrew from the process. At a minimum, the 
letter shall go to the tribal leader and all members of the tribal 
governing body. The agency shall follow up to confirm receipt of the 
letter.
    (d) Final Decision.--The agency shall provide a 60-day period 
following the issuance of the preliminary decision letter for response 
by the affected Indian tribes. Thereafter, the agency shall notify in 
writing, signed by the head of the agency, the affected Indian tribal 
governments, including those that withdrew from the process, of the 
agency's final decision.

SEC. 105. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING.

    (a) Official Consultation Record.--The agency shall keep an 
official consultation record that allows accurate tracking of the 
process so that agencies and consulting parties can correct any errors 
or omissions, and provides an official record of the process that can 
be referred to in any litigation that may arise. The agency shall 
document all efforts to initiate consultation as well as documenting 
the process once it has begun. Such documentation, including, but not 
limited to, correspondence, telephone logs, and emails, shall be 
included in the agency's official consultation record. The agency shall 
also keep notes so that the consultation record documents the content 
of consultation meetings, site visits, and phone calls in addition to 
information about dates and who participated.
    (b) Payment for Tribal Documentation Work.--If the agency asks an 
Indian tribe for specific information or documentation regarding the 
location, nature, and condition of individual sites, to conduct a 
survey, or in any way fulfill the duties of the agency in a role 
similar to that of a consultant or contractor, then the agency must pay 
for such services, if so requested by the Indian tribe, as it would for 
any private consultant or contractor.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Each agency shall on a biennial basis 
submit to Congress a report on its consultation activities.

SEC. 106. IMPLEMENTATION.

    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the head of each agency shall designate an official with principal 
responsibility for the agency's review of existing consultation and 
coordination policies and procedures, and implementation of this Act. 
Not later than 60 days after the effective date of this order, the 
designated official shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget 
a description of the agency's revised consultation process in 
conformity with this Act.

SEC. 107. SENSITIVE TRIBAL INFORMATION.

    Notwithstanding any provision of the Administrative Procedures Act, 
consultation meetings shall be closed to the public at the request of 
the Indian tribal government. Notwithstanding any provision of the 
Freedom of Information Act, all information designated by the Indian 
tribe as sensitive, such as the location of Sacred Sites or other 
details of cultural or religious practices, shall be deleted from any 
public publication made as part of the consultation process or in the 
process of carrying out the activity. Once information has been 
designated as sensitive, the agency will determine in consultation with 
the Indian tribe who may have access to the information for the 
purposes of carrying out the activity.

                      TITLE II--TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY

SEC. 201. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY.

    (a) In General.--Agencies shall recognize and respect Indian tribal 
self-government and sovereignty, honor tribal treaty and other rights, 
and strive to meet the responsibilities that arise from the unique 
legal relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribal 
governments.
    (b) Maximum Tribal Administrative Discretion.--With respect to 
Federal statutes and regulations administered by Indian tribal 
governments, the Federal Government shall grant Indian tribal 
governments the maximum administrative discretion possible.
    (c) Alternatives to Federal Regulation.--When undertaking to 
formulate and implement policies that have tribal implications, 
agencies shall--
            (1) encourage Indian tribes to develop their own policies 
        to achieve program objectives;
            (2) where possible, defer to Indian tribes to establish 
        standards; and
            (3) in determining whether to establish Federal standards, 
        consult with tribal officials as to the need for Federal 
        standards and any alternatives that would limit the scope of 
        Federal standards or otherwise preserve the prerogatives and 
        authority of Indian tribes.

                    TITLE III--INDIAN TRIBAL WAIVERS

SEC. 301. INDIAN TRIBAL WAIVERS.

    (a) Application Processes.--Agencies shall review the processes 
under which Indian tribes apply for waivers of statutory and regulatory 
requirements and take appropriate steps to streamline those processes.
    (b) Granting Maximum Tribal Latitude.--Each agency shall, to the 
extent practicable and permitted by law, consider any application by an 
Indian tribe for a waiver of statutory or regulatory requirements in 
connection with any program administered by the agency with a general 
view toward increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible policy 
approaches at the Indian tribal level. Maximum tribal latitude shall be 
granted in cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with the 
applicable Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.
    (c) Decision Timeline.--Each agency shall, to the extent 
practicable and permitted by law, render a decision upon a complete 
application for a waiver within 120 days of receipt of such application 
by the agency, or as otherwise provided by law or regulation. If the 
application for waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the 
applicant with timely written notice of the decision and the reasons 
therefor.
    (d) Limitation.--This section applies only to statutory or 
regulatory requirements that are discretionary and subject to waiver by 
the agency.

                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW

SEC. 401. JUDICIAL REVIEW.

    An Indian tribe may seek judicial review of a determination of an 
agency under this Act in accordance with subchapter II of chapter 5 of 
title 5, United States Code, and chapter 7 of title 5, United States 
Code (commonly known as the ``Administrative Procedure Act''), if the 
Indian tribe has exhausted all other administrative remedies available 
to the Indian tribe.
