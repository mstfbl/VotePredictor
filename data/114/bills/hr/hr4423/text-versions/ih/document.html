                    (B) low noise rotor designs;
                    (C) more cost-effective rotor designs that are able 
                to be integrated into current turbines;
                    (D) advanced drivetrain and generator concepts; and
                    (E) modular construction and onsite assembly 
                techniques;
            (3) offshore wind-specific projects including--
                    (A) fixed and floating substructure concepts;
                    (B) projects to assess and mitigate the impacts of 
                hurricane wind flow and other United States-specific 
                conditions;
                    (C) innovative operations and maintenance 
                strategies;
                    (D) analysis of offshore meteorological and 
                oceanographic data collection; and
                    (E) offshore infrastructure monitoring;
            (4) wind power forecasting and atmospheric measurement 
        systems;
            (5) the distributed wind energy sector;
            (6) transformational technologies for harnessing wind 
        energy, including airborne wind energy concepts; and
            (7) other research areas as determined by the Secretary.

SEC. 3. WIND ENERGY TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION AND MARKET TRANSFORMATION 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a wind 
energy technology validation and market transformation program. In 
carrying out this section, the Secretary shall ensure that--
            (1) the program demonstrates and validates new wind energy 
        technologies with the potential to be cost-competitive for 
        land-based, offshore, and distributed applications; and
            (2) demonstration projects carried out under this program 
        are--
                    (A) conducted in collaboration with industry and, 
                as appropriate, with academic institutions; and
                    (B) of sufficient size and geographic diversity to 
                measure wind energy system performance under the full 
                productive range of wind conditions in the United 
                States.
    (b) Cost-Sharing.--The Secretary shall carry out the program under 
this section in compliance with section 988(a) through (d) and section 
989 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16352(a) through (d) 
and 16353).

SEC. 4. WIND ENERGY EXPANSION PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a program of 
research, development, demonstration, and commercial application 
activities to reduce barriers to the widespread adoption of wind power. 
Barriers addressed by this program may include--
            (1) grid integration challenges; and
            (2) permitting issues associated with the potential impacts 
        of wind power systems on wildlife, radar systems, and airspace.
    (b) Wildlife Impact Mitigation.--The program described in this 
section shall support the development of new wildlife impact mitigation 
technologies to reduce the potential impacts of wind energy facilities
