                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of the Army to expedite the completion of 
  repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike, Florida, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. HERBERT HOOVER DIKE, FLORIDA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Herbert Hoover Dike, Florida, is classified as DSAC 
        Class 1, which is a classification for dams almost certain to 
        fail under normal operations from immediately to within a few 
        years without intervention.
            (2) The requirement for dams in this class is for the Corps 
        of Engineers to take immediate action to avoid failure.
            (3) Failure of the Herbert Hoover Dike is an urgent and 
        compelling concern for public safety.
            (4) Expeditious completion of repairs to the Herbert Hoover 
        Dike will significantly reduce the downstream adverse 
        environmental impacts from high rains.
            (5) A shortened timeline for such completion will give the 
        Corps of Engineers more flexibility in the Central Everglades 
        Planning Project because it will help send water south, where 
        it belongs, as opposed to east and west.
    (b) Implementation of Projects.--After completion of the study 
known as the Hebert Hoover Dike Dam Safety Modification Study, the 
Secretary of the Army shall--
            (1) carry out, without any further congressional 
        authorization, the projects recommended as part the study; and
            (2) complete the implementation of such projects not later 
        than December 31, 2020.

SEC. 2. EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION.

    For an additional amount for fiscal year 2016 to the Secretary of 
the Army to carry out this Act there is appropriated, out of any money 
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $800,000,000, to remain 
available until expended: Provided, That such amount is designated by 
the Congress as being for an emergency requirement pursuant to section 
251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
