                                 A BILL


 
 To require screening transparency and accountability of the TSA, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Screening Transparency and 
Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. ACCURACY IN THE FEDERAL COST ESTIMATE AND COST ESTIMATING 
              PRACTICES.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) shall, consistent with GAO's November 2015 report 
on the Screening Partnership Program (GAO-16-19), update the TSA's cost 
estimating methodology for Federal cost estimates and cost comparisons 
to conform to leading cost estimating best practices by, at a minimum--
            (1) incorporating a cost estimate that reflects the total 
        cost to the Federal Government, including all costs incurred by 
        Federal agencies other than TSA;
            (2) ensuring all cost estimates used by TSA are adjusted 
        for inflation, as appropriate, over the duration of the 
        contract;
            (3) updating all cost estimates when circumstances at a 
        Screening Partnership Program airport result in a significant 
        change to a contract's value, including--
                    (A) the opening or closing of an airport terminal;
                    (B) the change or alteration of airline service;
                    (C) the introduction of new technologies; or
                    (D) changes in policies and procedures;
            (4) including a sensitivity analysis that identifies which 
        variables have the greatest effect on cost estimates; and
            (5) reflecting the inherent uncertainty associated with the 
        cost estimate and identifying the elements of the cost estimate 
        that present the most risk.
    (b) Public Availability.--Not later than 30 days after the 
Administrator of the TSA completes the update required under subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall make such update available to the public.

SEC. 3. CUSTOMER SERVICE TRACKING AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

    (a) In General.--Not more than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the TSA shall develop a 
streamlined method and standard protocol for documenting and tracking 
customer complaints for both Federal and SPP airport checkpoints.
    (b) Consistency.--The Administrator of the TSA shall ensure 
consistent use across airports of methods to inform passengers about 
TSA's complaint and complaint resolution process.
    (c) Process.--The Administrator of the TSA shall establish a 
process for analyzing information on complaint trends from all 
screening complaint mechanisms, including a comparison between Federal 
screener complaints and private screener complaints.
    (d) Data Analysis.--The Administrator of the TSA shall utilize data 
analysis to better inform the traveling public about the nature and 
extent of screening complaints.

SEC. 4. INFORMATION SHARING WITH AIRPORT DIRECTORS.

    The Administrator of the TSA shall make available to airport 
directors, managers, and other individuals in similar airport 
leadership or executive positions (or selected designees) who have been 
cleared under section 1520 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, an 
assessment of each airport's performance compared to the mean average 
performance of all airports in the equivalent airport category for 
screening performance data, as well as a briefing on the results of 
performance data reports, including--
            (1) the TSA's Monthly Measures of Effectiveness Report 
        (MOE), including an assessment of each airport's performance 
        compared to the mean average performance of all airports in the 
        equivalent airport category;
            (2) the OSO Executive Scorecard; and
            (3) other performance data, including--
                    (A) passenger throughput;
                    (B) wait times; and
                    (C) employee attrition, absenteeism, injury rates, 
                and any other human capital measures collected by TSA.

SEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

    The Administrator of the TSA shall provide to Congress on an annual 
basis information related to the implementation of sections 2, 3 and 4.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
