carry out a pilot program under which the Secretary will enter into 
energy savings performance contracts under the authority of section 801 
of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8287) for the 
purpose of achieving direct energy savings and secondary savings in 
mobile assets of the Armed Forces under the jurisdiction of the 
Secretary and other nonbuilding applications of the military 
department.
    (b) Implementation Report.--Not later than two years after entering 
into the first energy savings performance contract under the pilot 
program, the Secretary of the military department concerned shall 
submit to Congress a report describing the implementation of the pilot 
program, including the number of energy savings performance contracts 
executed, the types of mobile assets and other nonbuilding applications 
covered, and the direct energy savings and secondary savings achieved.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Mobile asset and nonbuilding application.--The terms 
        ``mobile asset'' and ``nonbuilding application'' mean--
                    (A) any class of vehicles, devices, or equipment 
                that--
                            (i) is transportable under the power of the 
                        applicable vehicle, device, or equipment by 
                        land, sea, or air; and
                            (ii) consumes energy from any fuel source

        preparedness and resilience initiatives? If so, what are these 
        obstacles and do they require congressional action to increase 
        security on installations?
            (5) What opportunities exist for effective public private 
        partnerships or contracts with industry to address and mitigate 
        the effects of these conditions?
