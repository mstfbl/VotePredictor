(a), the Comptroller General of the United States may, as appropriate, 
provide information--
            (1) in a format that delineates high risk urban areas from

            (2) on the degree to which the selected State and local 
        programs and policies included in the report were developed or 
        are being executed with funding from the Department of Homeland 
        Security, including grant funding from the State Homeland 
        Security Grant Program or the Urban Area Security Initiative 
        under sections 2002 and 2003, respectively, of the Homeland
