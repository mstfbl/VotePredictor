        storage or safety devices on the utility of firearms with which 
        they may be used.
            (3) The effectiveness of ``smart gun'' technologies and 
        similar tools that verify the identity of a firearm user before

        rate of accidental and intentional firearm-related injuries and 
        fatalities.
            (4) The expected effects of the universal adoption of 
        effective secure gun storage or safety devices and ``smart 
        gun'' technology by firearm owners in the United States on the 
        rate of accidental and intentional firearm-related injuries and 
        fatalities.
            (5) The enforcement efforts of all Federal agencies 
        concerning potential violations of section 922(z) of title 18, 
        United States Code.
            (6) An estimate of the prevalence in the United States of 
        violations of that section.
            (7) The expected effects of effective enforcement of that 
        section on the rate of accidental and intentional firearm-
        related injuries and fatalities.
