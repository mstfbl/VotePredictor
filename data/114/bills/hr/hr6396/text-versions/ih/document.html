SEC. 2. MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS WITH POOLED PLAN PROVIDERS.

    (a) Qualification Requirements.--Section 413 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(e) Application of Qualification Requirements for Certain 
Multiple Employer Plans With Pooled Plan Providers.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if 
        a defined contribution plan to which subsection (c) applies--
                    ``(A) is sponsored by employers that both have a 
                common interest other than having adopted the plan and 
                control the plan, or
                    ``(B) in the case of a plan not described in 
                subparagraph (A), has a pooled plan provider,
        then the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the 
        requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in 
        section 401(a) or to a plan that consists of individual 
        retirement accounts described in section 408 of such Code 
        (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is 
        applicable, merely because one or more employers of employees 
        covered by the plan fail to take such actions as are required 
        of such employers for the plan to meet such requirements.
            ``(2) Limitations.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
                any plan unless the terms of the plan provide that in 
                cases of employers failing to take the actions 
                described in paragraph (1)--
                            ``(i) the assets of the plan attributable 
                        to employees of the employer will be 
                        transferred to a plan maintained only by the 
                        employer (or its successor), to an eligible 
                        retirement plan as defined in section 
                        402(c)(8)(B) for each individual whose account 
                        is transferred, or to any other arrangement 
                        that the Secretary determines is appropriate, 
                        unless the Secretary determines it is in the 
                        best interests of such employees to retain the 
                        assets in the plan, and
                            ``(ii) the employer described in clause (i) 
                        (and not the plan with respect to which the 
                        failure occurred or any other participating 
                        employer in such plan) shall, except to the 
                        extent provided by the Secretary, be liable for 
                        any liabilities with respect to such plan 
                        attributable to employees of the employer.
                    ``(B) Failures by pooled plan providers.--If the 
                pooled plan provider of a plan described in paragraph 
                (1)(B) does not perform substantially all of the 
                administrative duties which are required of the 
                provider under paragraph (3)(A)(i) for any plan year, 
                the Secretary, in the Secretary's own discretion, may 
                provide that the determination as to whether the plan 
                meets the requirements under this title applicable to a 
                plan described in section 401(a) or to a plan that 
                consists of individual retirement accounts described in 
                section 408 of such Code (including by reason of 
                subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, shall 
                be made in the same manner as would be made without 
                regard to paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Pooled plan provider.--For purposes of this 
        subsection--
