use of such product under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act, regardless of whether the intended use is registered 
and included in the label approved for the product by the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency under such Act.

Air Act for other purposes) in response to an emergency event in 
accordance with subsection (a).
    ``(g) Exclusive Authority of the Secretary.--The Secretary shall 
have the exclusive Federal authority with respect to determining which 
species are considered quarantine pests (as defined in section 319.37-1

the enactment of the Safe Agriculture Production Act of 2015).
    ``(h) Definitions.--
            ``(1) Emergency event.--The term `emergency event' means a 
        situation--
                    ``(A) that occurs at a location on which a plant or 
                commodity is grown or produced or a facility providing 
                for the storage of, or other services with respect to, 
                a plant or commodity;
                    ``(B) for which the lack of availability of methyl 
                bromide for a particular use would result in 
                significant economic loss to the owner, lessee, or 
                operator of such a location or facility or the owner, 
                grower, or purchaser of such a plant or commodity; and
                    ``(C) that, in light of the specific agricultural, 
                meteorological, or other conditions presented, requires 
                the use of methyl bromide to control a pest or disease 
                in such location or facility because there are no 
                technically or economically feasible alternatives to 
                methyl bromide easily accessible by an entity referred 
                to in subparagraph (B) at the time and location of the 
                event that--
                            ``(i) are registered under the Federal 
                        Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 
                        U.S.C. 136 et seq.) for the intended use or 
                        pest to be so controlled; and
                            ``(ii) would adequately control the pest or 
                        disease presented at such location or facility.
            ``(2) Pest.--The term `pest' has the meaning given such 
        term in section 2 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
        Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136).
            ``(3) Qualified use.--The term `qualified use' means, with 
        respect to methyl bromide, a methyl bromide treatment or 
        application in an amount not to exceed the limitations 
        specified in subsection (e) in response to an emergency 
        event.''.
