    TITLE II--TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING SUPPORT ACT

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Target Practice and Marksmanship 
Training Support Act''.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target 
        practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land 
        is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that land 
        have been closed to those activities;
            (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target 
        practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;
            (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal 
        land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including 
        continued population growth and development near former ranges;
            (4) providing opportunities for target practice and 
        marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and 
        non-Federal land can help--
                    (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, 
                and hunting activities; and
                    (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for 
                those activities;
            (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this 
        Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for 
        construction and expansion of public target ranges by making 
        available to States amounts that may be used for construction, 
        operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and
            (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased 
        Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion of 
        public target ranges.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to facilitate the 
construction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on 
Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land 
Management.

SEC. 203. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.

    In this title, the term ``public target range'' means a specific 
location that--
            (1) is identified by a governmental agency for recreational

            (3) may be supervised; and
            (4) may accommodate archery or rifle, pistol, or shotgun 
        shooting.

                before May 15, 2008, from a polar bear population from

    This title may be cited as the ``Recreational Lands Self-Defense 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 402. PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM VIOLENT CRIME.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that 
        ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
        infringed''.
            (2) Section 327.13 of title 36, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, provides that, except in special circumstances, 
        ``possession of loaded firearms, ammunition, loaded projectile 
        firing devices, bows and arrows, crossbows, or other weapons is 
        prohibited'' at water resources development projects 
        administered by the Secretary of the Army.
            (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent 
        individuals complying with Federal and State laws from 
        exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while 
        at such water resources development projects.
            (4) The Federal laws should make it clear that the second 
        amendment rights of an individual at a water resources 
        development project should not be infringed.
    (b) Protecting the Right of Individuals To Bear Arms at Water 
Resources Development Projects.--The Secretary of the Army shall not 
promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from 
possessing a firearm, including an assembled or functional firearm, at 
a water resources development project covered under section 327.0 of 
title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of 
enactment of this Act), if--

 TITLE VI--RECREATIONAL FISHING AND HUNTING HERITAGE OPPORTUNITIES ACT

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Recreational Fishing and Hunting 
Heritage and Opportunities Act''.

SEC. 602. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and 
        traditional activities in which millions of Americans 
        participate;
            (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue 
        to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and wildlife 
        management and conservation in the United States;
            (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally 
        acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be 
        provided on Federal lands and waters without adverse effects on 
        other uses or users;
            (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting 
        organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife 
        managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government as 
        well as State and local governments by investing volunteer time 
        and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;
            (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated 
        industries have generated billions of dollars of critical 
        funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and 
        management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing and 
        hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise taxes 
        on fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting equipment that 
        have generated billions of dollars of critical funding for fish 
        and wildlife conservation, research, and management;
            (6) recreational shooting is also an important and 
        traditional activity in which millions of Americans 
        participate;
            (7) safe recreational shooting is a valid use of Federal 
        lands, including the establishment of safe and convenient 
        recreational shooting ranges on such lands, and participation 
        in recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and 
        contributes to wildlife conservation;
            (8) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot 
        are declining, which depresses participation in these 
        traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely 
        impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for 
        important conservation efforts; and
            (9) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' 
        fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure 
        that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and 
        hunting on Federal land as recognized by Executive Order No. 
        12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive Order 
        No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage and 
        wildlife conservation.

        availability of fishing, hunting, or recreational shooting 
        opportunities on adjacent or nearby public or private lands in 
        the planning for or determination of which Federal lands are 
        open for these activities or in the setting of levels of use 
        for these activities on Federal lands, unless the combination 
        or coordination of such opportunities would enhance the 
        fishing, hunting, or recreational shooting opportunities 
        available to the public.
    (e) Federal Lands.--
            (1) Lands open.--Lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau

        Monuments, but excluding lands on the Outer Continental Shelf, 
        shall be open to fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting 
        unless the managing Federal agency acts to close lands to such 
        activity. Lands may be subject to closures or restrictions if 
        determined by the head of the agency to be necessary and 
        reasonable and supported by facts and evidence, for purposes 
        including resource conservation, public safety, energy or 
        mineral production, energy generation or transmission 
        infrastructure, water supply facilities, protection of other 
        permittees, protection of private property rights or interest,

                        jurisdiction of the agency for recreational 
                        shooting ranges; and
                            (ii) designate specific lands under the 
                        jurisdiction of the agency for recreational 
                        shooting activities.
                    (B) Limitation on liability.--Any designation under 
                subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not subject the United

    (f) Necessity in Wilderness Areas and ``Within and Supplemental 
to'' Wilderness Purposes.--
            (1) Minimum requirements for administration.--The provision 
        of opportunities for fishing, hunting, and recreational 
        shooting, and the conservation of fish and wildlife to provide 
        sustainable use recreational opportunities on designated 
        Federal wilderness areas shall constitute measures necessary to 
        meet the minimum requirements for the administration of the 
        wilderness area, provided that this determination shall not 
        authorize or facilitate commodity development, use, or 
        extraction, motorized recreational access or use that is not 
        otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et 
        seq.), or permanent road construction or maintenance within 
        designated wilderness areas.
            (2) Application of wilderness act.--Provisions of the 
        Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), stipulating that 
        wilderness purposes are ``within and supplemental to'' the 
        purposes of the underlying Federal land unit are reaffirmed. 
        When seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation 
        programs and projects or provide fish and wildlife dependent 
        recreation opportunities on designated wilderness areas, each 
        Federal land management official shall implement these 
        supplemental purposes so as to facilitate, enhance, or both, 
        but not to impede the underlying Federal land purposes when 
        seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation programs 
        and projects or provide fish and wildlife dependent recreation 
        opportunities in designated wilderness areas, provided that 
        such implementation shall not authorize or facilitate commodity 
        development, use or extraction, or permanent road construction 
        or maintenance within designated wilderness areas.
    (g) No Priority.--Nothing in this section requires a Federal land 
management official to give preference to fishing, hunting, or 
recreational shooting over other uses of Federal land or over land or 
water management priorities established by Federal law.
    (h) Consultation With Councils.--In fulfilling the duties under 
this section, Federal land management officials shall consult with 
respective advisory councils as established in Executive Order Nos. 
12962 and 13443.
    (i) Authority of the States.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as interfering with, diminishing, or conflicting with the 
authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility of any State to exercise 
primary management, control, or regulation of fish and wildlife under 
State law (including regulations) on land or water within the State, 
including on Federal land.
    (j) Federal Licenses.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
to authorize a Federal land management official to require a license, 
fee, or permit to fish, hunt, or trap on land or water in a State, 
including on Federal land in the States, except that this subsection 
shall not affect the Migratory Bird Stamp requirement set forth in the 
Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C. 718 et 
seq.).
