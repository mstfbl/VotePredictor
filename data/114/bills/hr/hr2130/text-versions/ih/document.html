SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.

    For the purposes of this Act:
            (1) Affected area.--The term ``affected area'' means lands 
        along the approximately 116-mile stretch of the Red River from 
        its confluence with the North Fork of the Red River on the west 
        to the 98th meridian on the east between the States of Texas 
        and Oklahoma.
            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of the Interior, acting through the Director of Bureau of Land 
        Management.
            (3) South bank.--The term ``South Bank'' means the water-
        washed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity, 
        commonly called a cut bank, along the southerly or right side 
        of the Red River which separates its bed from the adjacent 
        upland, whether valley or hill, and usually serves to confine 
        the waters within the bed and to preserve the course of the 
        river; as specified in the fifth paragraph of the decree 
        rendered March 12, 1923, in Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340, 43 
        S. Ct. 376, 67 L. Ed. 687.
            (4) South bank boundary line.--The term ``South Bank 
        boundary line'' means the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma 
        identified through the gradient boundary survey method; as 
        specified in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the decree 
        rendered March 12, 1923, in Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340, 43

            (5) Gradient boundary survey method.--The term ``gradient 
        boundary survey method'' means the measurement technique used 
        to locate the South Bank boundary line under the methodology 
        established by the United States Supreme Court which recognizes 
        that the boundary line between the States of Texas and Oklahoma 
        along the Red River is subject to such changes as have been or 
        may be wrought by the natural and gradual processes known as 
        erosion and accretion as specified in the second, third, and 
        fourth paragraphs of the decree rendered March 12, 1923, in 
        Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340, 43 S. Ct. 376, 67 L. Ed. 687.
