 Mr. Foster (for himself, Ms. Edwards, Ms. Castor of Florida, Mr. Ryan 
  of Ohio, Mr. Polis, Mr. Honda, Mr. David Scott of Georgia, and Mr. 
   Swalwell of California) introduced the following bill; which was 
        referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a STEM grant program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Partnerships for Progress and 
Prosperity Act'' or the ``P3 Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) As part of their Blueprint for Action researchers at 
        Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Pathways to 
        Prosperity Network recommend creating programs designed to 
        ``combine work and academic learning in post-secondary career 
        preparation''. In a followup study to the original ``Pathways 
        to Prosperity'' published by Harvard's Graduate School of 
        Education in 2011, the same researchers released ``A Blueprint 
        for Action'' in June 2014.
            (2) The Executive Office of Science and Technology Policy 
        has explicitly stated a goal of strengthening America's STEM 
        workforce.
            (3) According to a study by the Manufacturing Institute, a 
        national survey of United States manufacturing executives found 
        that 83 percent of American manufacturers reported a moderate 
        or severe shortage of skilled workers.
            (4) The American Enterprise Institute further states that, 
        ``According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the percentage of 
        manufacturing workers aged 55 to 64 and the share of workers 
        older than 65 have both significantly increased since 2000. 
        Moreover, they also report that the median age of the 
        manufacturing workforce increased from 40.5 in 2000 to 44.1 in 
        2011. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers predicts that the 
        shortfall of skilled factory workers could increase to 3 
        million jobs by 2015 due to the aging manufacturing workforce 
        and the resulting retirements of older workers, at the same 
        time that an anticipated manufacturing rebound will increase 
        demand for skilled workers.''.
            (5) The 2012 Program for International Student Assessment 
        found the United States below the average score of 
        participating countries in mathematics and science. 
        Furthermore, the United States has dropped in the rankings for 
        mathematics achievement from 25th in 2009 to 36th in 2012.
            (6) NAE, along with other peer-reviewed publications and 
        studies from universities around the country have examined the 
        benefits of partnerships between schools and outside 
        organizations. Partnerships for Progress and Prosperity Act 
        programs as well as experiential learning play an important 
        role in training students for the jobs of the future.

        entity demonstrates a rationale based on high-quality research 
        findings or positive evaluation that the activity proposed to 
        be funded with the grant is likely to improve student outcomes
