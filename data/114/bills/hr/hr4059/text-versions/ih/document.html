    ``Sec. 1849.  (a) In General.--
            ``(1) Establishment of program.--The Secretary shall 
        establish and implement an Advance Directive Certification 
        Program (in this section referred to as the `Program') under 
        which the Secretary shall encourage eligible beneficiaries to 
        adopt and maintain certified advance directives to guide the 
        delivery of health care to such beneficiaries. The Secretary 
        shall implement the Program not later than 3 years after the 
        date of enactment of this section.
            ``(2) Definitions.--In this section:
                    ``(A) Certified advance directive.--The term 
                `certified advance directive' means any electronically 
                stored statement by an eligible beneficiary who--
                            ``(i) provides instructions that outline 
                        the kind of medical treatments and care that 
                        such beneficiary would want or not want under 
                        particular conditions, and may also include the 
                        identification of a health care proxy or legal 
                        representative to make medical treatment 
                        decisions for the beneficiary if the 
                        beneficiary becomes unable to make or 
                        communicate those decisions;
                            ``(ii) is executed in accordance with the 
                        law governing advance directives of the State 
                        involved; and
                            ``(iii) is offered by an entity that has 
                        received accreditation from the Secretary under 
                        this section.
                    ``(B) Eligible beneficiary.--The term `eligible 
                beneficiary' means an individual enrolled under this 
                part.
            ``(3) Voluntary.--Participation in the Program shall be 
        voluntary with respect to the eligible beneficiary and an 
        eligible beneficiary who has registered a certified advance 
        directive under the Program may terminate such directive at any 
        time. Nothing in this section shall require an eligible 
        beneficiary to adopt or maintain a certified advance directive.
            ``(4) Best practices.--In establishing and implementing the 
        Program, the Secretary shall consider best practices within 
        existing advance directive registry technologies, programs, and 
        systems, including web-based or cloud-based advance directive 
        technologies, which may utilize time and date stamps, video, or 
        other innovative measures to protect the authenticity, improve 
        the quality, and enhance the security of such directives.
            ``(5) Enrollment and disenrollment.--The Secretary shall 
        establish procedures for eligible beneficiaries to enroll and 
        disenroll under the Program. Such procedures shall ensure that 
        enrollment and disenrollment is available through an online 
        process. The Secretary shall also establish procedures to 
        ensure Program participants can update or amend an advance 
        directive in a timely and secure manner.
            ``(6) State law.--This section shall in no way supercede, 
        abrogate, or otherwise interfere with State law governing 
        advance directives. Under the Program, the Secretary shall 
        establish a process under which the Secretary is required to 
        verify that digital advance directive vendors or other entities 
        providing a digital advance directive participating in the 
        program enable those using their services to complete advance 
        directives that fully comply with the law governing advance 
        directives of the State involved.
            ``(7) Display of statutory and alternative advance 
        directive forms.--Under the Program, the Centers for Medicare & 
        Medicaid Services shall provide, through a clearinghouse 
        website, links to statutory and alternative advance directive 
        forms and a State-by-State index to such forms to allow a 
        beneficiary to create, adopt, modify, and terminate an advance 
        directive with any content permitted or required, and in any 
        form authorized by a State, in accordance with the requirements 
        of subparagraphs (C) through (E) of subsection (e)(1) and 
        subsection (e)(2).

        Program:
                    ``(A) Special access.--The Secretary shall 
                establish a process whereby, with respect to a 
                beneficiary with a certified advance directive, a 
                person described in subparagraph (B) may obtain access 
                to the beneficiary's advance directive for the purposes 
                of viewing and sharing such advance directive when--
                            ``(i) the provisions of the advance 
                        directive have come into force under the 
                        applicable State's law because the beneficiary 
                        has become incapable of making health care 
                        decisions or under other circumstances provided 
                        under State law; and

                        class of persons who, under the applicable 
                        State's law, would potentially be eligible to 
                        serve as a health care decision maker for the 
                        beneficiary if an advance directive had not 
                        been executed regardless of whether higher 
                        priority for such eligibility would be accorded 
                        to another individual or individuals; and

        that an advance directive has been terminated.
            ``(2) Required information.--In addition to such other

    ``WHY YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AN `ADVANCE DIRECTIVE' Do you ever 
worry what would happen if you became unable to make health care 
decisions for yourself because of an illness or injury? That's what an 
`advance directive' is for. You can use it to give directions for your 
health care providers and family about your health care wishes that are 
to be followed if you are no longer able to speak for yourself. You can 
also name someone you trust, like a family member or friend, to give 
health care directions for you when you can't do so yourself.
    ``You should consider carefully who to choose to speak for you and 
what directions you want to give to ensure your representative clearly 
reflects your own values and treatment preferences. You should not feel 
pressured to violate your own values and preferences, and you are 
entitled to implement them without discrimination based on age or 
degree of disability.
    ``There are many resources to help you.
    ``By choosing the name of a state at [INSERT name of webpage for 
the index provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection and its URL (and, 
on the clearinghouse website, include a hyperlink to it)], you can find 
sample advance directives for that state. You can see any sample or 
required forms given in state law, as well as others from individuals 
or groups with different viewpoints on advance health care decisions 
which you may wish to review before completing your own advance 
directive.
    ``Below is contact information for accredited vendors who will 
arrange for your advance directive to be confidentially kept online, 
where it can be seen by doctors who are treating you so they are made 
aware of your wishes. You can also give permission to certain other 
people, like family members or friends, you want to be able to get a 
copy of your advance directive. If a disagreement about your treatment 
develops, depending on your state's law certain other people may also 
be allowed to see it.
    ``These vendors can also help you create an advance directive 
online or with paper documents, if you wish. Online directives allow 
you to change or cancel one that no longer fits with your wishes in a 
more timely manner.
    ``[INSERT, in alphabetical order, the names and contact information 
for currently accredited advance directive vendors (and, on the 
clearinghouse website, hyperlinks to their websites).]
    ``Although any adult who is capable of doing so can use these 
resources to complete an advance directive at any time, Medicare 
beneficiaries are particularly encouraged to do so when enrolling in 
Medicare or during the annual enrollment period when you can choose 
among different Medicare health insurance alternatives.
    ``In addition, some Medicare Advantage plans or supplemental 
insurance plans may offer a financial incentive or other additional 
benefits for creating an advance directive online.
    ``By completing an advance directive you can not only make it more 
likely that your wishes about health care will be known if you are 
unable to tell them at the time, but also spare family, friends, and 
doctors the difficulty of trying to figure out what you would have 
wanted. These are matters of the highest importance that can affect 
life-or-death decisions, as well as your future comfort and well-being. 
You are encouraged to think about them carefully, and give serious 
consideration to recording your wishes in an advance directive.''.
