                                 A BILL


 
   To prohibit the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the 
 Environmental Protection Agency from taking the social cost of carbon 
or the social cost of methane into account when taking any action, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transparency and Honesty in Energy 
Regulations Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following--
            (1) As a tool to justify Federal actions by the Department 
        of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter 
        in this section referred to as the ``EPA'') addressing 
        greenhouse gas emissions, including those regulating or 
        prohibiting the exploration, mining, production, and use of 
        coal as well as other fossil fuels as energy sources, the 
        Social Cost of Carbon (hereinafter in this section referred to 
        as the ``SCC'') and the Social Cost of Methane (hereinafter in 
        this section referred to as the ``SCM'') in theory represent 
        the hypothetical cost of an incremental ton of carbon dioxide 
        (CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt;) or methane emissions in a given year.
            (2) Office of Management and Budget (hereinafter in this 
        section referred to as the ``OMB'') Circular A-4 guides Federal 
        agencies on the development of regulatory impact analysis 
        required under Executive Order 12866 as well as other 
        authorities, instructing agencies to include discount rates of 
        3 and 7 percent while also evaluating the cost and benefits 
        that accrue to citizens and residents of the United States.
            (3) First developed in 2009 by an interagency working 
        group, including the Department of Energy and the EPA, the SCC 
        estimates fail to comply with OMB Circular A-4 prescribed 
        discount rates of 3 and 7 percent.
            (4) While OMB Circular A-4 specifies that an evaluation of 
        the global effects, when undertaken, is to be reported 
        separately from domestic costs and benefits, the SCC instead 
        calculated the global benefits in lieu of and not in addition 
        to the domestic effects.
            (5) The use of the SCC estimates in Department of Energy 
        and EPA rulemakings prior to any opportunity for public notice 
        and comment violated not only scientific peer-review 
        requirements but also the President's commitment to transparent 
        and open government as outlined in his January 21, 2009, 
        memorandum to the heads of executive departments and agencies.
            (6) In July 2015, as part of a revision of the SCC in 
        response to over 150 substantive comments and in acknowledgment 
        of the faulty process by which the SCC estimates were 
        developed, the OMB requested the National Academies of Science, 
        Engineering and Medicine (hereinafter in this section referred 
        to as the ``NAS'') review and make recommendations for the 
        improvement of the SCC estimates.
            (7) Shortly after the commencement of the NAS review, the 
        EPA, without appropriate peer review and an opportunity for 
        public notice and comment, utilized the EPA-developed SCM 
        estimates in justifying the costs and benefits of the September 
        2015 proposed and recently finalized rules under the Clean Air 
        Act for methane emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed 
        sources in the oil and gas sector.
            (8) Continued use by the Department of Energy and the EPA 
        of the SCC and the SCM ignores sound science in order to 
        eliminate the exploration, mining, production, and use of our 
        abundant domestic sources of fossil fuel energy.
            (9) The Department of Energy and EPA regulations, which are 
        costing American families billions of dollars per year, are 
        being justified in large part by SCC and SCM estimates.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERING THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND THE 
              SOCIAL COST OF METHANE.

    The Secretary of Energy, when acting under any authority, and the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when acting under 
the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), may not 
consider the social cost of carbon or the social cost of methane as 
part of any cost benefit analysis required under law or under Executive 
Order 12866 or 13563, in any rulemaking, in the issuance of any 
guidance, or in taking any other agency action, or as a justification 
for any rulemaking, guidance document, or agency action, unless a 
Federal law is enacted, after the date of enactment of this Act, 
explicitly authorizing such consideration.

SEC. 4. REPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE EPA.

    Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in 
coordination and consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the 
Secretary of the Interior, and the Council on Environmental Quality 
shall submit a report to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and on 
Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committees on 
the Environment and Public Works and on Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate, detailing the number of proposed and final rulemakings, 
guidance documents, and agency actions since January 2009 that use the 
social cost of carbon or the social cost of methane, including as part 
of any cost benefit analysis required under Executive Order 12866 and 
other relevant authorities.
