SECTION 1. TABLE OF CONTENTS.

  The table of contents for this Act is as follows:

Sec. 1.  Table of contents.
Sec. 2.  Purpose; restatement does not change meaning or effect of 
          existing law.
Sec. 3.  Enactment of title 55, United States Code.
Sec. 4.  Conforming amendments.
Sec. 5.  Transitional and savings provisions.
Sec. 6.  Repeals.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEANING OR EFFECT OF 
                    EXISTING LAW.

  (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to codify certain existing 
laws relating to the environment as a positive law title of the United 
States Code.
  (b) Restatement Does Not Change Meaning or Effect of Existing Law.--
          (1) In general.--The restatement of existing law enacted by 
        this Act does not change the meaning or effect of the existing 
        law. The restatement consolidates various provisions that were 
        enacted separately over a period of many years, reorganizing 
        them, conforming style and terminology, modernizing obsolete 
        language, and correcting drafting errors. These changes serve 
        to remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other imperfections, 
        but they do not change the meaning or effect of the existing 
        law or impair the precedential value of earlier judicial 
        decisions or other interpretations.
          (2) Rule of construction.--
                  (A) In general.--Notwithstanding the plain meaning 
                rule or other rules of statutory construction, a change 
                in wording made in the restatement of existing law 
                enacted by this Act serves to clarify the existing law 
                as indicated in paragraph (1), but not to change the 
                meaning or effect of the existing law.
                  (B) Revision notes.--Subparagraph (A) applies whether 
                or not a change in wording is explained by a revision 
                note appearing in a congressional report accompanying 
                this Act. If such a revision note does appear, a court 
                shall consider the revision note in interpreting the 
                change.

under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill 
the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future 
generations of Americans.
  (b) Responsibility of the Federal Government.--To carry out the 
policy set forth in this chapter, it is the continuing responsibility

        individual choice;
          (5) achieve a balance between population and resource use 
        that will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of

                  (B) Effect of procedures.--The procedures under this 
                paragraph shall not relieve the Federal official of the 
                official's responsibilities for the scope, objectivity, 
                and content of the entire statement or of any other 
                responsibility under this chapter, and this paragraph

low-level flight training as a precondition to the use by the Armed 
Forces of an airspace for the performance of low-level training 
flights.
  (e) Accelerated Decisionmaking.--
          (1) In general.--In preparing a final environmental impact 
        statement under this section, if the lead agency modifies the 
        statement in response to comments that are minor and are 
        confined to factual corrections or explanations of why the 
        comments do not warrant additional agency response, the lead 
        agency may write on an errata sheet attached to the statement, 
        instead of rewriting the draft statement, if the errata sheet--
                  (A) cites the sources, authorities, or reasons that 
                support the position of the lead agency; and
                  (B) if appropriate, indicates the circumstances that 
                would trigger a reappraisal or further response by the 
                lead agency.
          (2) Single document.--To the maximum extent practicable, the 
        lead agency shall expeditiously develop a single document that 
        consists of a final environmental impact statement and a record 
        of decision, unless--
                  (A) the final environmental impact statement makes 
                substantial changes to the proposed action that are 
                relevant to environmental or safety concerns; or
                  (B) there are significant new circumstances or 
                information relevant to environmental concerns and that 
                bear on the proposed action or the impacts of the 
                proposed action.
  (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section has any effect on the 
specific statutory obligations of any Federal agency--
          (1) to comply with criteria or standards of environmental 
        quality;
          (2) to coordinate or consult with any other Federal or State 
        agency; or
          (3) to act or refrain from acting contingent on the 
        recommendations or certification of any other Federal or State

                  (B) Requirements.--The Administrator may treat an 
                Indian tribe as a State only if--

                        protection of air resources within the exterior 
                        boundaries of the reservation or other areas

                        to be capable, in the judgment of the 
                        Administrator, of carrying out the functions to

          (4) Treatment.--In any case in which the Administrator 
        determines that the treatment of Indian tribes as identical to

        the Administrator will directly administer the provisions 
        specified under paragraph (2) so as to achieve the appropriate

                          (i) a statement of basis and purpose like 
                        that described in paragraph (4)(B) with respect 
                        to a proposed rule;

                        written or oral presentations during the

                  (B) Basis.--A promulgated rule may not be based (in 
                part or whole) on any information or data that have not

                promulgation.
          (9) Judicial review.--
                  (A) Record.--The record for judicial review shall 
                consist exclusively of the material described in 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4), 
                subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (6), and 
                paragraph (8)(A).
                  (B) Objections.--
                          (i) In general.--Only an objection to a rule 
                        or a procedure that was raised with reasonable 
                        specificity during the comment period 
                        (including any public hearing) may be raised 
                        during judicial review.
                          (ii) Impracticality of raising objection; 
                        grounds arising after comment period.--If the 
                        person raising an objection demonstrates to the 
                        Administrator that it was impracticable to 
                        raise an objection within the comment period or 
                        if the grounds for an objection arose after the 
                        comment period (but within the time specified 
                        for judicial review), and if the objection is 
                        of central relevance to the outcome of the 
                        rule, the Administrator shall convene a 
                        proceeding for reconsideration of the rule and 
                        provide the same procedural rights as would 
                        have been afforded had the information been 
                        available at the time at which the rule was 
                        proposed. If the Administrator refuses to 
                        convene such a proceeding, the person may seek 
                        review of the refusal in the United States 
                        court of appeals for the appropriate circuit 
                        (as provided in subsection (b)). 
                        Reconsideration shall not stay the 
                        effectiveness of the rule, but the 
                        Administrator or the court may stay the 
                        effectiveness of the rule during 
                        reconsideration for not more than 3 months.
          (10) Procedural determinations.--
                  (A) Sole forum.--The sole forum for challenging 
                procedural determinations made by the Administrator 
                under this subsection shall be in the United States 
                court of appeals for the appropriate circuit (as 
                provided in subsection (b)) at the time of the 
                substantive review of the rule.
                  (B) No interlocutory appeal.--No interlocutory appeal 
                shall be permitted with respect to a procedural 
                determination made by the Administrator under this 
                subsection.
                  (C) Invalidation of rule.--In reviewing alleged 
                procedural errors, the court may invalidate a rule only 
                if the errors were so serious and related to matters of 
                such central relevance to the rule that there is a 
                substantial likelihood that the rule would have been 
                significantly changed if the errors had not been made.
          (11) Reversal.--A court may reverse any action found to be--
                  (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or 
                otherwise not in accordance with law;
                  (B) contrary to constitutional right, power, 
                privilege, or immunity;
                  (C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, 
                or limitations, or short of statutory right; or
                  (D) without observance of procedure required by law, 
                if--
                          (i) the failure to observe the procedure is 
                        arbitrary or capricious;
                          (ii) the requirement of paragraph (9)(B) has 
                        been met; and
                          (iii) the condition of paragraph (10)(C) is 
                        met.
          (12) Statutory deadlines.--A statutory deadline for 
        promulgation of a rule that requires promulgation less than 6 
        months after the date of proposal may be extended to not more 
        than 6 months after the date of proposal by the Administrator 
        on a determination that the extension is necessary to afford 
        the public and EPA adequate opportunity to carry out the 
        purposes of this subsection.
  (e) No Other Judicial Review.--Nothing in this division shall be 
construed to authorize judicial review of regulations or orders of the 
Administrator under this division, except as provided in this section.
  (f) Costs.--In any judicial proceeding under this section, the court 
may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney's fees and 
expert witness's fees) whenever the court determines that such an award 
is appropriate.
  (g) Stay, Injunction, or Similar Relief in Proceedings Relating to 
Noncompliance Penalties.--In any civil action respecting the 
promulgation of regulations under, or the administration or enforcement 
of, section 211119 of this title, the court shall not grant any stay, 
injunctive relief, or similar relief before final judgment by the 
court.
  (h) Public Participation.--It is the intent of Congress that, 
consistent with the policy of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, 
the Administrator in promulgating any regulation under this division, 
including a regulation subject to a deadline, shall ensure that there 
is a reasonable period for public participation of at least 30 days, 
except as otherwise expressly provided in sections 211107(d), 
215102(a), 215202, and 215302 of this title.
Sec. 203103. Emergency powers
  (a) Civil Action.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
division, the Administrator, on receipt of evidence that a pollution 
source or combination of sources (including moving sources) is 
presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or 
welfare, or the environment, may bring a civil action on behalf of the 
United States in the appropriate United States district court to 
immediately restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged 
pollution to stop the emission of air pollutants causing or 
contributing to the pollution or to take such other action as may be 
necessary.
  (b) Issuance of Orders by the Administrator.--If it is not 
practicable to ensure prompt protection of public health or welfare or 
the environment by commencement of a civil action under subsection (a), 
the Administrator may issue such orders as may be necessary to protect 
public health or welfare or the environment.
  (c) Consultation.--Prior to taking any action under this section, the 
Administrator shall consult with appropriate State and local 
authorities and attempt to confirm the accuracy of the information on 
which the action proposed to be taken is based.
  (d) Effectiveness.--Any order issued by the Administrator under this 
section shall be effective on issuance and shall remain in effect for a 
period of not more than 60 days, unless the Administrator brings a 
civil action pursuant to subsection (a) before the expiration of that 
period. Whenever the Administrator brings such a civil action within 
the 60-day period, the order shall remain in effect for an additional 
14 days or for such longer period as may be authorized by the court in 
which the civil action is brought.

                  (A) In general.--A United States district court shall 
                have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in 
                controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to--

                        limitation or an order described in paragraph 
                        (1)(B)(ii), or to order the Administrator to

                        any civil penalty to be assessed under this 
                        subsection, the court shall take into 
                        consideration (in addition to such other 
                        factors as justice may require)--
                                  (I) the size of the business;
                                  (II) the economic impact of the civil 
                                penalty on the business;
                                  (III) the violator's full compliance 
                                history and good faith efforts to 
                                comply;
                                  (IV) the duration of the violation as 
                                established by any credible evidence 
                                (including evidence other than the 
                                applicable test method);
                                  (V) payment by the violator of 
                                penalties previously assessed for the 
                                same violation;
                                  (VI) the economic benefit of 
                                noncompliance; and
                                  (VII) the seriousness of the 
                                violation.
                          (ii) Civil penalty for each day of 
                        violation.--A civil penalty may be assessed for 
                        each day of violation. For purposes of 
                        determining the number of days of violation for 
                        which a civil penalty may be assessed under 
                        this subsection, where the Administrator or an 
                        air pollution control agency has notified the 
                        source of the violation, and the plaintiff 
                        makes a prima facie showing that the conduct or 
                        events giving rise to the violation are likely 
                        to have continued or recurred past the date of 
                        notice, the days of violation shall be presumed 
                        to include the date of the notice and each day 
                        thereafter until the violator establishes that 
                        continuous compliance has been achieved, except 
                        to the extent that the violator can prove by a 
                        preponderance of the evidence that there were 
                        intervening days during which no violation 
                        occurred or that the violation was not 
                        continuing in nature.
          (5) Compulsion of agency action.--A United States district 
        court shall have jurisdiction to compel (consistent with 
        paragraph (2)) agency action unreasonably delayed, except that 
        a civil action to compel agency action under section 203102(b) 
        of this title that is unreasonably delayed may be filed only in 
        a United States district court within the circuit in which the 
        civil action would be reviewable under section 203102(b) of 
        this title. In any such civil action for unreasonable delay, 
        notice to the entities described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) 
        shall be provided 180 days before commencing the civil action.

                                  (III) any alleged violator of the 
                                emission standard or limitation or 
                                order; or
                          (ii) if the Administrator or State has 
                        commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil

                        State to require compliance with the emission 
                        standard or limitation or order (but in any 
                        such civil action in a court of the United 
                        States any person may intervene as a matter of 
                        right); or
                  (B) under subsection (b)(2) prior to 60 days after 
                the plaintiff has given notice of the civil action to 
                the Administrator.
          (2) Exception.--A civil action under this section respecting

        section 211113(d) of this title for the procurement of goods, 
        materials, and services to perform the contract at any facility 
        at which the violation that gave rise to the conviction 
        occurred if the facility is owned, leased, or supervised by 
        that person.
          (2) Time period.--The prohibition under paragraph (1) shall 
        continue until the Administrator certifies that the condition 
        giving rise to the conviction has been corrected.
          (3) Inclusion of substantive violation.--In the case of a 
        conviction arising under paragraph (2) of section 211113(d) of 
        this title, the condition giving rise to the conviction also

          (1) requires each Federal agency authorized to enter into 
        contracts and each Federal agency that is empowered to extend 
        Federal assistance by way of grant, loan, or contract to 
        effectuate the purpose and policy of this division in such 
        contracting or assistance activities; and

                any United States letters patent that is being used or 
                intended for public or commercial use and that is not

                accomplish that purpose; and
          (2) that the unavailability of that right may result in a 
        substantial lessening of competition or tendency to create a 
        monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the country;

                provides for the increase in emissions of each air 
                pollutant from stationary and mobile sources in any 
                area to which chapter 213 or 215 applies for that 
                pollutant, which increase may reasonably be anticipated 
                to result directly or indirectly from the new sewage 
                treatment capacity that would be created by the 
                construction;
                  (C) the construction of the treatment works would 
                create new sewage treatment capacity that--
                          (i) may reasonably be anticipated to cause or 
                        contribute, directly or indirectly, to an 
                        increase in emissions of any air pollutant in 
                        excess of the increase provided for under the 
                        provisions described in subparagraph (B) for 
                        any such area; or
                          (ii) would otherwise not be in conformity 
                        with the applicable implementation plan; or
                  (D) the increase in emissions would interfere with, 
                or be inconsistent with, the applicable implementation 
                plan for any other State.
          (2) Increase in emissions of air pollutant from stationary 
        and mobile sources in an area to which chapter 215 applies.--In 
        the case of construction of a treatment works that would 
        result, directly or indirectly, in an increase in emissions of 
        any air pollutant from stationary and mobile sources in an area 
        to which chapter 215 applies, the quantification of emissions 
        described in paragraph (1)(B) shall include the emissions of 
        any such pollutant resulting directly or indirectly from 
        areawide and nonmajor stationary source growth (mobile and 
        stationary) for each such area.
  (c) Chapter 105.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to--
          (1) amend or alter any provision of chapter 105; or

          (2) Sole method of enforcement.--The sole method for 
        enforcement of the Administrator's duty under this section 
        shall be by bringing a civil action under section 203104(b)(2) 
        of this title for a court order to compel the Administrator to 
        perform the duty. Violation of any such order shall subject the 
        Administrator to penalties for contempt of court.
  (g) Costs.--In the case of any provision of this division in which 
costs are expressly required to be taken into account, the adequacy or 
inadequacy of any assessment required under this section may be taken 
into consideration, but shall not be treated for purposes of judicial 
review of any such provision as conclusive with respect to compliance 
or noncompliance with the requirement of the provision to take cost 
into account.
Sec. 209109. Air quality monitoring
  (a) In General.--
          (1) Regulations.--After notice and opportunity for public 
        hearing, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations 
        establishing an air quality monitoring system throughout the 
        United States that--
                  (A) utilizes uniform air quality monitoring criteria 
                and methodology and measures the air quality according 
                to a uniform air quality index;
                  (B) provides for air quality monitoring stations in 
                major urban areas and other appropriate areas 
                throughout the United States to provide monitoring such 
                as will supplement (but not duplicate) air quality 
                monitoring carried out by the States required under any 
                applicable implementation plan;
                  (C) provides for daily analysis and reporting of air 
                quality based on the uniform air quality index; and
                  (D) provides for recordkeeping with respect to the 
                monitoring data and for periodic analysis and reporting

        considers appropriate. Any air quality monitoring system 
        required under any applicable implementation plan under section 
        211110 of this title shall, as soon as practicable following 
        promulgation of regulations under this section, utilize the 
        standard criteria and methodology, and measure air quality 
        according to the standard index, established under the 
        regulations.
  (b) Air Quality Monitoring Data Influenced by Exceptional Events.--
          (1) Definition of exceptional event.--In this section:
                  (A) In general.--The term ``exceptional event'' means 
                an event that--
                          (i) affects air quality;
                          (ii) is not reasonably controllable or 
                        preventable;
                          (iii) is caused by human activity that is 
                        unlikely to recur at a particular location or 
                        is a natural event; and
                          (iv) is determined by the Administrator 
                        through the process established in the 
                        regulations promulgated under paragraph (2) to 
                        be an exceptional event.
                  (B) Exclusions.--The term ``exceptional event'' does 
                not include--
                          (i) stagnation of air masses or 
                        meteorological inversions;

                  (A) Principles.--In promulgating regulations under 
                this section, the Administrator shall follow the 
                principles that--
                          (i) protection of public health is the 
                        highest priority;
                          (ii) timely information should be provided to 
                        the public in any case in which the air quality 
                        is unhealthy;
                          (iii) all ambient air quality data should be 
                        included in a timely manner, in an appropriate 
                        Federal air quality database that is accessible 
                        to the public;
                          (iv) each State must take necessary measures 
                        to safeguard public health regardless of the 
                        source of the air pollution; and
                          (v) air quality data should be carefully 
                        screened to ensure that events not likely to 
                        recur are represented accurately in all 
                        monitoring data and analyses.
                  (B) Requirements.--Regulations promulgated under this 
                section shall, at a minimum, provide that--
                          (i) the occurrence of an exceptional event 
                        must be demonstrated by reliable, accurate data 
                        that are promptly produced and provided by 
                        Federal, State, or local government agencies;
                          (ii) a clear causal relationship must exist 
                        between the measured exceedances of a NAAQS and 
                        the exceptional event to demonstrate that the 
                        exceptional event caused a specific air 
                        pollution concentration at a particular air 
                        quality monitoring location;
                          (iii) there is a public process for 
                        determining whether an event is an exceptional 
                        event; and
                          (iv) there are criteria and procedures for 
                        the Governor of a State to petition the 
                        Administrator to exclude air quality monitoring 
                        data that are directly due to exceptional 
                        events from use in determinations by the 
                        Administrator with respect to exceedances or 
                        violations of the NAAQSes.

        issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review must be 
        filed within 60 days from the issuance of the Secretary's 
        order. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. The 
        commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, 
        unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the 
        Secretary's order.
          (2) No other review.--An order of the Secretary with respect 
        to which review could have been obtained under paragraph (1)

        district court shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the 
        amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to 
        enforce the order.

        barrels per day.
  (b) Marketers of Gasoline.--The regulations under this division 
applicable to vapor recovery from fueling of motor vehicles at retail

to prohibit any State from adopting or enforcing, with respect to 
independent small business marketers of gasoline having monthly sales 
of less than 50,000 gallons, any vapor recovery requirements for mobile

        unique geographical, meteorological, or economic factors of the 
        territory or commonwealth or to such other local factors as the 
        Administrator considers significant.
          (3) Consideration.--A petition under paragraph (1) shall be 
        considered in accordance with section 203102(d) of this title,

                and
                  (B) any regulation relating to sulfur dioxide 
                standards or limitations contained in a State 
                implementation plan approved under section 211110 of 
                this title as of December 8, 1983, except as provided 
                in paragraph (2).
          (2) Expiration.--The exemptions under paragraph (1) shall

Sec. 211101. Findings; purposes; primary goal
  (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
          (1) the predominant part of the Nation's population is 
        located in its rapidly expanding metropolitan and other urban 
        areas, which generally cross the boundary lines of local 
        jurisdictions and often extend into 2 or more States;
          (2) the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution 
        brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the 
        increasing use of motor vehicles has resulted in mounting 
        dangers to the public health and welfare, including injury to 
        agricultural crops and livestock, damage to and the 
        deterioration of property, and hazards to air and ground 
        transportation;
          (3) air pollution prevention (that is, the reduction or 
        elimination, through any measures, of the amount of pollutants 
        produced or created at the source) and air pollution control at 
        its source are the primary responsibility of States and local 
        governments; and
          (4) Federal financial assistance and leadership are essential 
        for the development of cooperative Federal, State, regional, 
        and local programs to prevent and control air pollution.
  (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subdivision are--
          (1) to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air 
        resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and 
        the productive capacity of its population;
          (2) to initiate and accelerate a national research and 
        development program to achieve the prevention and control of 
        air pollution;
          (3) to provide technical and financial assistance to State 
        and local governments in connection with the development and 
        execution of their air pollution prevention and control 
        programs; and
          (4) to encourage and assist the development and operation of 
        regional air pollution prevention and control programs.
  (c) Primary Goal.--A primary goal of this division is to encourage or 
otherwise promote reasonable Federal, State, and local governmental 
actions, consistent with this division, for pollution prevention.

          (2) enactment of improved and, so far as practicable in the 
        light of varying conditions and needs, uniform State and local 
        laws relating to the prevention and control of air pollution; 
        and
          (3) the making of agreements and compacts between States for 
        the prevention and control of air pollution.
  (b) Federal Cooperation.--The Administrator shall cooperate with and 
encourage cooperative activities by all Federal departments and 
agencies having functions relating to the prevention and control of air 
pollution, so as to ensure the utilization in the Federal air pollution

resources within the Federal Government.
  (c) Consent of Congress to Compacts.--
          (1) In general.--The consent of Congress is given to 2 or 
        more States to negotiate and enter into agreements or compacts, 
        not in conflict with any law or treaty of the United States, 
        for--
                  (A) cooperative effort and mutual assistance for the 
                prevention and control of air pollution and the 
                enforcement of their respective laws relating thereto; 
                and
                  (B) the establishment of such agencies, joint or 
                otherwise, as the States consider desirable for making 
                effective such agreements or compacts.
          (2) No binding effect without approval by congress.--No 
        agreement or compact under paragraph (1) shall be binding or 
        obligatory on any State a party thereto unless and until the 
        agreement or compact is approved by Congress.
          (3) Intent of congress.--It is the intent of Congress that no 
        agreement or compact entered into between States after November 
        21, 1967, that relates to the control and abatement of air 
        pollution in an air quality control region shall provide for

Sec. 211105. Grants for support of air pollution planning and control 
                    programs
  (a) Definition of Implement.--In this section, the term 
``implement'', in the context of implementation of a program or of a 
primary or secondary NAAQS, means to engage in any activity related to 
the planning, developing, establishing, carrying out, improving, or 
maintaining of the program or primary or secondary NAAQS.
  (b) In General.--
          (1) Grants.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator may make a grant 
                to an air pollution control agency described in 
                subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (E) of section 
                201101 of this title in an amount up to \3/5\ of the 
                cost of implementing programs for the prevention and 
                control of air pollution or implementation of primary 
                and secondary NAAQSes.
                  (B) Failure to contribute minimum required amount.--
                Subject to subsections (c) and (d), an air pollution 
                control agency that receives a grant under subparagraph 
                (A) shall contribute the required \2/5\ minimum. If an 
                air pollution control agency fails to meet and maintain 
                the required level, the Administrator shall reduce the 
                amount of the Federal contribution accordingly.
                  (C) Air quality control regions or portions thereof 
                for which there is an applicable implementation plan.--
                With respect to any air quality control region or 
                portion thereof for which there is an applicable 
                implementation plan under section 211110 of this title, 
                a grant under subparagraph (A) may be made only to an 
                air pollution control agency that has substantial 
                responsibilities for carrying out the applicable 
                implementation plan.
          (2) Air pollution control agencies established by 2 or more 
        states or municipalities.--Before approving any grant under 
        this subsection to any air pollution control agency described 
        in subparagraph (B) or (D) of section 201101(2) of this title, 
        the Administrator shall receive assurances that the air 
        pollution control agency--
                  (A) provides for adequate representation of 
                appropriate State, interstate, local, and (when 
                appropriate) international interests in the air quality 
                control region; and
                  (B) has the capability of developing a comprehensive 
                air quality plan for the air quality control region, 
                which plan shall include--
                          (i) (when appropriate) a recommended system 
                        of alerts to avert and reduce the risk of 
                        situations in which there may be imminent and 
                        serious danger to the public health or welfare 
                        from air pollutants; and
                          (ii) the various aspects relevant to the 
                        establishment of air quality standards for that 
                        air quality control region, including the 
                        concentration of industries, other commercial 
                        establishments, population, and naturally 
                        occurring factors that affect those air quality 
                        standards.
  (c) Terms and Conditions; Limitation on Grant Amounts.--
          (1) Terms and conditions.--From the sums available for the 
        purposes of subsection (b) for any fiscal year, the 
        Administrator shall from time to time make grants to air 
        pollution control agencies on such terms and conditions as the 
        Administrator may find necessary to carry out this section. In 
        establishing regulations for the granting of such funds the 
        Administrator shall, so far as practicable, give due 
        consideration to--
                  (A) the population;
                  (B) the extent of the actual or potential air 
                pollution problem; and
                  (C) the financial need of the respective air 
                pollution control agencies.
          (2) Limitation on grant amounts.--Not more than 10 percent of 
        the total of funds appropriated or allocated for the purposes 
        of subsection (b) shall be granted for programs in any 1 State. 
        In the case of a grant for a program in an area crossing State 
        boundaries, the Administrator shall determine the portion of 
        the grant that is chargeable to the percentage limitation under 
        this subsection for each State into which the area extends.
          (3) Minimum amount.--Subject to paragraph (1), no State shall 
        have made available to it for application less than 0.5 percent 
        of the annual appropriation for grants under this section for 
        grants to air pollution control agencies within the State.
  (d) Maintenance of Effort.--
          (1) Expenditures.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
                no air pollution control agency shall receive any grant 
                under this section during any fiscal year when its 
                expenditures of non-Federal funds for recurrent 
                expenditures for air pollution control programs will be 
                less than its expenditures were for such programs 
                during the preceding fiscal year. In order for the 
                Administrator to award grants under this section in a 
                timely manner each fiscal year, the Administrator shall 
                compare an air pollution control agency's prospective 
                expenditure level to that of its 2d preceding fiscal 
                year.
                  (B) Consideration of exemptions.--In prescribing 
                regulations that define applicable nonrecurrent and 
                recurrent expenditures, the Administrator shall give 
                due consideration to exempting an air pollution control 
                agency from the limitations of this paragraph and 
                subsection (b) due to increases experienced by that air 
                pollution control agency from time to time in its 
                annual expenditures for purposes acceptable to the 
                Administrator for that fiscal year.
          (2) Nonselective reduction in expenditures.--The 
        Administrator may award a grant to an air pollution control 
        agency that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if 
        the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for public 
        hearing, determines that a reduction in expenditures is 
        attributable to a nonselective reduction in the expenditures in 
        the programs of all executive branch agencies of the applicable 
        unit of government.
          (3) Use to supplement or increase non-federal funds.--No air 
        pollution control agency shall receive any grant under this 
        section with respect to the maintenance of a program for the 
        prevention and control of air pollution unless the 
        Administrator is satisfied that such a grant will be used to 
        supplement and, to the extent practicable, increase the level 
        of State, local, or other non-Federal funds.
          (4) Consultation.--No grant shall be made under this section 
        until the Administrator has consulted with the appropriate 
        official as designated by the Governor or Governors of the 
        State or States affected.
  (e) Reduction of Payments.--The Administrator, with the concurrence 
of any recipient of a grant under this section, may reduce the payments 
to the recipient by the amount of the pay, allowances, traveling 
expenses, and any other costs in connection with the detail of any 
officer or employee to the recipient under section 203101 of this 
title, when the detail is for the convenience of, and at the request 
of, the recipient and for the purpose of carrying out this division. 
The amount by which such payments have been reduced shall be available 
for payment of such costs by the Administrator, but shall, for the 
purpose of determining the amount of any grant to a recipient under 
subsection (b), be deemed to have been paid to the recipient.
  (f) Notice and Opportunity for Hearing.--No application by a State 
for a grant under this section may be disapproved by the Administrator 
without prior notice and opportunity for a public hearing in the 
affected State, and no commitment or obligation of any funds under any 
such grant may be revoked or reduced without prior notice and 
opportunity for a public hearing in the affected State (or in 1 of the 
affected States if more than 1 State is affected).
Sec. 211106. Interstate air quality agencies
  (a) In General.--For the purpose of developing implementation plans 
for any interstate air quality control region designated pursuant to 
section 211107 of this title or of implementing section 215108 or 
215205 of this title, the Administrator may pay, for 2 years, up to 100 
percent of the air quality planning program costs of--
          (1) any commission established under either of those 
        sections; or
          (2) any agency designated by the Governors of the affected 
        States, which agency--
                  (A) shall be capable of recommending to the Governors 
                plans for implementation of primary and secondary 
                NAAQSes; and
                  (B) shall include representation from the States and 
                appropriate political subdivisions within the air 
                quality control region.
  (b) Subsequent Years.--After the initial 2-year period, the 
Administrator may make grants to a commission or agency described in 
subsection (a) in an amount up to \3/5\ of the air quality 
implementation program costs of the commission or agency.
Sec. 211107. Air quality control regions
  (a) State Responsibility.--Each State shall have the primary 
responsibility for ensuring air quality within the entire geographic 
area comprising the State by submitting an implementation plan for the 
State that specifies the manner in which primary and secondary NAAQSes 
will be achieved and maintained within each air quality control region 
in the State.
  (b) Designated Air Quality Control Regions.--For purposes of 
developing and carrying out State implementation plans under section 
211110 of this title--

        section before December 31, 1970, or a region designated after 
        that date under subsection (c), shall be an air quality control 
        region; and
          (2) the portion of a State that is not part of any such 
        designated region shall be an air quality control region, but 
        that portion may be subdivided by the State into 2 or more air 
        quality control regions with the approval of the Administrator.
  (c) Designation by the Administrator.--After consultation with 
appropriate State and local authorities, the Administrator shall 
designate as an air quality control region any interstate area or major 
intrastate area that the Administrator considers necessary or 
appropriate for the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality 
standards. The Administrator shall immediately notify the Governors of 
the affected States of any designation made under this subsection.
  (d) Designations.--
          (1) Designations generally.--
                  (A) Submission by governors of initial designations 
                following promulgation of new or revised standards.--
                          (i) In general.--By such date as the 
                        Administrator may reasonably require, but not 
                        later than 1 year after promulgation of a new 
                        or revised NAAQS for any pollutant under 
                        section 211109 of this title, the Governor of 
                        each State shall (and at any other time the 
                        Governor of a State considers appropriate the 
                        Governor may) submit to the Administrator a 
                        list of all areas (or portions thereof) in the 
                        State, designating as--
                                  (I) nonattainment, any area that does 
                                not meet (or that contributes to 
                                ambient air quality in a nearby area 
                                that does not meet) the primary or 
                                secondary NAAQS for the pollutant;
                                  (II) attainment, any area (other than 
                                an area identified in subclause (I)) 
                                that meets the primary or secondary 
                                NAAQS for the pollutant; or
                                  (III) unclassifiable, any area that 
                                cannot be classified on the basis of 
                                available information as meeting or not 
                                meeting the primary or secondary NAAQS 
                                for the pollutant.
                           (ii) Timing.--The Administrator may not 
                        require a Governor to submit a list required 
                        under clause (i) sooner than 120 days after 
                        promulgating a new or revised NAAQS.
                  (B) Promulgation of designations by the 
                administrator.--
                          (i) In general.--On promulgation or revision 
                        of a NAAQS, the Administrator shall promulgate 
                        the designations of all areas (or portions 
                        thereof) submitted under subparagraph (A) as 
                        expeditiously as practicable, but in no case 
                        later than 2 years after the date of 
                        promulgation of the new or revised NAAQS. The 
                        2-year period may be extended for up to 1 year 
                        if the Administrator has insufficient 
                        information to promulgate the designations.
                          (ii) Modifications.--In making the 
                        promulgations required under clause (i), the 
                        Administrator may make such modifications as 
                        the Administrator considers necessary to the 
                        designations of the areas (or portions thereof) 
                        submitted under subparagraph (A)(i) (including 
                        to the boundaries of the areas or portions 
                        thereof). Whenever the Administrator intends to 
                        make a modification, the Administrator shall 
                        notify the State and provide the State with an 
                        opportunity to demonstrate why any proposed 
                        modification is inappropriate. The 
                        Administrator shall give the notification not 
                        later than 120 days before the date the 
                        Administrator promulgates the designation, 
                        including any modification to the designation. 
                        If the Governor fails to submit the list in 
                        whole or in part, as required under 
                        subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall 
                        promulgate the designation that the 
                        Administrator considers appropriate for any 
                        area (or portion thereof) not designated by the 
                        State.
                          (iii) Submission of list on governor's own 
                        motion.--If the Governor of any State, on the 
                        Governor's own motion, submits a list of areas 
                        (or portions thereof) in the State designated 
                        as nonattainment, attainment, or 
                        unclassifiable, the Administrator shall act on 
                        the designations in accordance with the 
                        procedures under paragraph (3).
                          (iv) Effective period.--A designation for an 
                        area (or portion thereof) made pursuant to this 
                        subsection shall remain in effect until the 
                        area (or portion thereof) is redesignated 
                        pursuant to paragraph (3) or (4).

                          (i) Nonattainment.--Any area designated with 
                        respect to any air pollutant under subparagraph 
                        (A), (B), or (C) of section 107(d)(1) of the 
                        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)) (as in 
                        effect on November 14, 1990) is designated, by 
                        operation of law, as a nonattainment area for 
                        that air pollutant within the meaning of 
                        subparagraph (A)(i)(I).
                          (ii) Attainment.--Any area designated with 
                        respect to any air pollutant under subparagraph

                        (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)) (as in effect on 
                        November 14, 1990) is designated by operation 
                        of law, as an attainment area for that air 
                        pollutant within the meaning of subparagraph 
                        (A)(i)(II).
                          (iii) Unclassifiable.--Any area designated 
                        with respect to any air pollutant under 
                        subparagraph (D) of section 107(d)(1) of the 
                        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)) (as in 
                        effect on November 14, 1990) is designated, by 
                        operation of law, as an unclassifiable area for 
                        that air pollutant within the meaning of 
                        subparagraph (A)(i)(III).
          (2) Publication of designations and redesignations.--
                  (A) Notice.--The Administrator shall publish a notice 
                in the Federal Register promulgating any designation 
                under paragraph (1) or (5), announcing any designation 
                under paragraph (4), or promulgating any redesignation 
                under paragraph (3).
                  (B) Nonapplicability of other law.--Promulgation or 
                announcement of a designation under paragraph (1), (4) 
                or (5) shall not be subject to sections 553 to 557 of 
                title 5, except that nothing in this subparagraph shall 
                be construed as precluding such public notice and 
                comment whenever possible.
          (3) Redesignation.--
                  (A) Notification.--Subject to subparagraph (E), on 
                the basis of air quality data, planning and control 
                considerations, or any other air quality-related 
                considerations that the Administrator considers 
                appropriate, the Administrator may at any time publicly 
                notify the Governor of any State that available 
                information indicates that the designation of any area 
                or portion of an area within the State or interstate 
                area should be revised. In issuing such a notification 
                to the Governor, the Administrator shall provide such 
                information as the Administrator may have available 
                explaining the basis for the notification.
                  (B) Submission of redesignation.--Not later than 120 
                days after receiving a notification under subparagraph 
                (A), the Governor shall submit to the Administrator 
                such redesignation, if any, of the appropriate area (or 
                areas) or portion thereof within the State or 
                interstate area, as the Governor considers appropriate.
                  (C) Promulgation of redesignation.--Not later than 
                120 days after the date described in subparagraph (B) 
                (or paragraph (1)(B)(iii)), the Administrator shall 
                promulgate the redesignation, if any, of the area or 
                portion thereof, submitted by the Governor in 
                accordance with subparagraph (B), making such 
                modifications as the Administrator considers necessary, 
                in the same manner and under the same procedure as is 
                applicable under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B), 
                except that ``60 days'' shall be substituted for ``120 
                days'' in that clause. If the Governor does not submit, 
                in accordance with subparagraph (B), a redesignation 
                for an area (or portion thereof) identified by the 
                Administrator under subparagraph (A), the Administrator 
                shall promulgate such redesignation, if any, as the 
                Administrator considers appropriate.
                  (D) Redesignation on governor's own motion.--The 
                Governor of any State may, on the Governor's own 
                motion, submit to the Administrator a revised 
                designation of any area or portion thereof within the 
                State. Within 18 months after receipt of a complete 
                State redesignation submittal, the Administrator shall 
                approve or deny the redesignation. The submission of a 
                redesignation by a Governor shall not affect the 
                effectiveness or enforceability of the applicable State 
                implementation plan.
                  (E) Redesignation of nonattainment to attainment.--
                The Administrator may not promulgate a redesignation of 
                a nonattainment area (or portion thereof) to attainment 
                unless--
                          (i) the Administrator determines that the 
                        area has attained the NAAQS;
                          (ii) the Administrator has fully approved the 
                        applicable State implementation plan for the 
                        area under section 211110(i) of this title;
                          (iii) the Administrator determines that the 
                        improvement in air quality is due to permanent 
                        and enforceable reductions in emissions 
                        resulting from implementation of the applicable 
                        State implementation plan and applicable 
                        Federal air pollutant control regulations and 
                        other permanent and enforceable reductions;
                          (iv) the Administrator has fully approved a 
                        maintenance plan for the area as meeting the 
                        requirements of section 215106 of this title; 
                        and
                          (v) the State containing the area has met all 
                        requirements applicable to the area under 
                        section 211110 of this title and chapter 215.
                  (F) No redesignation from nonattainment to 
                unclassifiable.--The Administrator shall not promulgate 
                any redesignation of any area (or portion thereof) from 
                nonattainment to unclassifiable.
          (4) Nonattainment designations for ozone, carbon monoxide, 
        and particulate matter (pm-10).--
                  (A) Ozone and carbon monoxide.--
                          (i) Submissions by governors.--The Governor 
                        of each State shall submit to the Administrator 
                        a list that designates, affirms or reaffirms 
                        the designation of, or redesignates all areas 
                        (or portions thereof) of the Governor's State 
                        as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable 
                        with respect to the NAAQSes for ozone and 
                        carbon monoxide.
                          (ii) Promulgation.--The Administrator shall 
                        promulgate the designations required under 
                        clause (i), making such modifications as the 
                        Administrator considers necessary, in the same 
                        manner and under the same procedure as is 
                        applicable under clause (ii) of paragraph 
                        (1)(B), except that ``60 days'' shall be 
                        substituted for ``120 days'' in that clause. If 
                        the Governor does not submit, in accordance 
                        with clause (i) of this subparagraph, a 
                        designation for an area (or portion thereof), 
                        the Administrator shall promulgate the 
                        designation that the Administrator considers 
                        appropriate.
                          (iii) No redesignation as attainment.--No 
                        nonattainment area may be redesignated as an 
                        attainment area under this subparagraph.
                          (iv) Areas classified as a serious area, 
                        severe area, or extreme area.--Notwithstanding 
                        paragraph (1)(C)(ii), if an ozone or carbon 
                        monoxide nonattainment area located within a 
                        metropolitan statistical area or consolidated 
                        metropolitan statistical area (as established 
                        by the Bureau of the Census) is classified 
                        under chapter 215 as a serious area, severe 
                        area, or extreme area, the boundaries of the 
                        area are revised (on the date that is 45 days 
                        after such classification) by operation of law 
                        to include the entire metropolitan statistical 
                        area or consolidated metropolitan statistical 
                        area, as the case may be, unless within that 
                        45-day period the Governor (in consultation 
                        with State and local air pollution control 
                        agencies) notifies the Administrator that 
                        additional time is necessary to evaluate the 
                        application of clause (v). When a Governor has 
                        submitted such a notice to the Administrator, 
                        the boundary revision shall occur on the date 
                        that is 8 months after the date of the 
                        classification unless the Governor makes the 
                        finding described in clause (v), and the 
                        Administrator concurs in the finding, within 
                        that period. Except as otherwise provided in 
                        this paragraph, a boundary revision under this 
                        clause or clause (v) shall apply for purposes 
                        of any State implementation plan revision.
                          (v) Exclusion of portion of area.--Whenever 
                        the Governor of a State has submitted a notice 
                        under clause (iv), the Governor, in 
                        consultation with State and local air pollution 
                        control agencies, shall undertake a study to 
                        evaluate whether the entire metropolitan 
                        statistical area or consolidated metropolitan 
                        statistical area should be included within the 
                        nonattainment area. Whenever a Governor finds 
                        and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                        Administrator, and the Administrator concurs in 
                        the finding, that with respect to a portion of 
                        a metropolitan statistical area or consolidated 
                        metropolitan statistical area, sources in the 
                        portion do not contribute significantly to 
                        violation of the NAAQS, the Administrator shall 
                        approve the Governor's request to exclude that 
                        portion from the nonattainment area. In making 
                        the finding, the Governor and the Administrator 
                        shall consider factors such as population 
                        density, traffic congestion, commercial 
                        development, industrial development, 
                        meteorological conditions, and pollution 
                        transport.
                  (B) PM-10 designations.--
                          (i) In general.--By operation of law, until 
                        redesignation by the Administrator pursuant to 
                        paragraph (3)--
                                  (I) each area identified in 52 Fed.

                                I area (except to the extent that such 
                                identification was modified by the 
                                Administrator before November 15, 1990) 
                                is designated nonattainment for PM-10;
                                  (II) any area containing a site for 
                                which air quality monitoring data show 
                                a violation of the NAAQS for PM-10 
                                before January 1, 1989 (as determined 
                                under part 50, appendix K of title 40, 
                                Code of Federal Regulations), is 
                                designated nonattainment for PM-10; and
                                  (III) each area not described in 
                                subclause (I) or (II) is designated 
                                unclassifiable for PM-10.
                          (ii) Continuance in effect of certain 
                        designations.--Any designation for particulate 
                        matter (measured in terms of total suspended 
                        particulates) that the Administrator 
                        promulgated pursuant to section 107(d) of the

        Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate 
        margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health. 
        The primary NAAQSes may be revised in the same manner as 
        promulgated.
          (2) Secondary naaqses.--Any secondary NAAQS promulgated under 
        subsection (a) shall specify a level of air quality the 
        attainment and maintenance of which, in the judgment of the 
        Administrator, based on such criteria, is requisite to protect 
        the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse 
        effects associated with the presence of an air pollutant in the 
        ambient air. The secondary NAAQSes may be revised in the same 
        manner as promulgated.
  (c) Primary NAAQS for Nitrogen Dioxide.--The Administrator shall 
promulgate a primary NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide concentrations over a 
period of not more than 3 hours unless, based on the criteria issued 
under section 211108(c) of this title, the Administrator finds that 
there is no significant evidence that such a standard for such a period 
is requisite to protect public health.
  (d) Review of Criteria and Standards.--
          (1) In general.--
                  (A) 5-year intervals.--At 5-year intervals, the 
                Administrator shall--
                          (i) complete a thorough review of the 
                        criteria published under section 211108 of this 
                        title and the NAAQSes promulgated under this 
                        section; and
                          (ii) make such revisions in the criteria and 
                        standards and promulgate such new standards as 
                        may be appropriate in accordance with section 
                        211108 of this title and subsection (b).
                  (B) More frequent intervals.--The Administrator may 
                review and revise criteria or promulgate new standards 
                more frequently than required under this paragraph.

                        the requirements respecting State boards under 
                        section 211127 of this title; and
                          (iii) necessary assurances that, where the 
                        State has relied on a local or regional 
                        government, agency, or instrumentality for the 
                        implementation of any plan provision, the State 
                        has responsibility for ensuring adequate 
                        implementation of the plan provision;

                        of information available to the Administrator 
                        that the plan is substantially inadequate to 
                        attain the NAAQS that it implements or to 
                        otherwise comply with any additional 
                        requirements established under this division;

                division, a fee under an approved fee program under 
                subdivision 6; and
                  (M) provide for consultation and participation by 
                local political subdivisions affected by the plan.
          (4) Plan revision.--
                  (A) Review.--As soon as practicable, the 
                Administrator shall, consistent with the purposes of 
                this division and the Energy Supply and Environmental 
                Coordination Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 791 et seq.), 
                review each State's applicable implementation plans and 
                report to the State on whether the plans can be revised 
                in relation to fuel burning stationary sources (or 
                persons supplying fuel to such sources) without 
                interfering with the attainment and maintenance of any 
                NAAQS within the period permitted in this section. If 
                the Administrator determines that any such plan can be 
                revised, the Administrator shall notify the State that 
                a plan revision may be submitted by the State. Any plan 
                revision that is submitted by the State shall, after 
                public notice and opportunity for public hearing, be 
                approved by the Administrator if the revision relates 
                only to fuel burning stationary sources (or persons 
                supplying fuel to such sources), and the plan as 
                revised complies with paragraph (3). The Administrator 
                shall approve or disapprove any revision not later than 
                3 months after its submission.
                  (B) Limitation.--Neither the State, in the case of a 
                plan (or portion thereof) approved under this 
                subsection, nor the Administrator, in the case of a 
                plan (or portion thereof) promulgated under subsection 
                (c), shall be required to revise an applicable 
                implementation plan because 1 or more suspensions under 
                subsection (d) or (e) or exemptions under section 
                211118 of this title have been granted, if the plan 
                would have met the requirements of this section if no 
                such suspension or exemption had been granted.
          (5) Indirect source review programs.--

                                        or facility at, within, or 
                                        associated with a source 
                                        described in subclause (I) or 
                                        (II).
                          (ii) Indirect source review program.--The 
                        term ``indirect source review program'' means 
                        the facility-by-facility review of indirect 
                        sources of air pollution, including such 
                        measures as are necessary to ensure, or assist 
                        in ensuring, that a new or modified indirect 
                        source will not attract mobile sources of air 
                        pollution, the emissions from which would cause 
                        or contribute to air pollution concentrations--
                                  (I) exceeding any primary NAAQS for a 
                                mobile source-related air pollutant 
                                after the primary standard attainment 
                                date; or
                                  (II) preventing maintenance of any 
                                such standard after that date.
                  (B) Inclusion in state implementation plan.--
                          (i) In general.--Any State may include in a 
                        State implementation plan, but the 
                        Administrator may not require as a condition of 
                        approval of such a plan under this section, any 
                        indirect source review program.
                          (ii) Approval and enforcement by the 
                        administrator.--The Administrator may approve 
                        and enforce, as part of an applicable 
                        implementation plan, an indirect source review 
                        program that the State chooses to adopt and 
                        submit as part of its plan.
                          (iii) Revision.--Any State may revise an 
                        applicable implementation plan approved under 
                        this subsection to suspend or revoke an 
                        indirect source review program included in the 
                        plan, provided that the plan meets the 
                        requirements of this section.
                  (C) Plans promulgated by the administrator.--
                          (i) In general.--Except as provided in clause 
                        (ii), no plan promulgated by the Administrator 
                        shall include any indirect source review 
                        program for any air quality control region, or 
                        portion thereof.
                          (ii) Federally assisted or federally owned or 
                        operated sources.--The Administrator may 
                        promulgate, implement, and enforce regulations 
                        under subsection (c) respecting indirect source 
                        review programs that apply only to federally 
                        assisted highways, airports, and other major 
                        federally assisted indirect sources and 
                        federally owned or operated indirect sources.
  (b) Extension of Period for Submission of Plans.--The Administrator 
may, wherever the Administrator determines it to be necessary, extend 
the period for submission of any plan or portion thereof that 
implements a secondary NAAQS for a period not to exceed 18 months after 
the date otherwise required for submission of the plan.
  (c) Federal Implementation Plans.--
          (1) Promulgation.--The Administrator shall promulgate a 
        Federal implementation plan at any time within 2 years after 
        the Administrator--
                  (A) finds that a State has failed to make a required 
                submission or finds that the plan or plan revision 
                submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum 
                criteria established under subsection (i)(1)(A); or
                  (B) disapproves a State implementation plan 
                submission in whole or in part;
        unless the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator 
        approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator 
        promulgates the Federal implementation plan.
          (2) Parking surcharge regulation.--
                  (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:
                          (i) Management of parking supply.--The term 
                        ``management of parking supply'' includes any 
                        requirement providing that any new facility 
                        containing a given number of parking spaces 
                        shall receive a permit or other prior approval, 
                        issuance of which is to be conditioned on air 
                        quality considerations.
                          (ii) Parking surcharge regulation.--The term 
                        ``parking surcharge regulation'' means a 
                        regulation imposing or requiring the imposition 
                        of any tax, surcharge, fee, or other charge on 
                        parking spaces, or any other area used for the 
                        temporary storage of motor vehicles.
                          (iii) Preferential bus/carpool lane.--The 
                        term ``preferential bus/carpool lane'' includes 
                        any requirement for the setting aside of 1 or 
                        more lanes of a street or highway on a 
                        permanent or temporary basis for the exclusive 
                        use of buses or carpools, or both.
                  (B) No requirement by the administrator.--
                          (i) Federal implementation plan.--No parking 
                        surcharge regulation may be required by the 
                        Administrator under paragraph (1) as a part of 
                        an applicable implementation plan. All parking 
                        surcharge regulations previously required by 
                        the Administrator are void.
                          (ii) State implementation plan.--The 
                        Administrator may not condition approval of any 
                        implementation plan submitted by a State on the 
                        plan's including a parking surcharge 
                        regulation.
                          (iii) Requirement by a state.--This 
                        subparagraph shall not preclude the 
                        Administrator from approving a parking 
                        surcharge regulation if it is adopted and 
                        submitted by a State as part of an applicable 
                        implementation plan.
                  (C) Management of parking supply; preferential bus/
                carpool lanes.--No standard, plan, or requirement, 
                relating to management of parking supply or 
                preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promulgated 
                after June 22, 1974, by the Administrator pursuant to 
                this section unless the promulgation has been subjected 
                to a public hearing held in the affected area for which 
                reasonable notice has been given in that area. If 
                substantial changes are made after public hearing, 1 or 
                more additional hearings shall be held in the area 
                after such notice.
          (3) Delegation of authority.--On application of the chief 
        executive officer of any general purpose unit of local 
        government, if the Administrator determines that the unit has 
        adequate authority under State or local law, the Administrator 
        may delegate to the unit the authority to implement and enforce 
        within the jurisdiction of the unit any part of a plan 
        promulgated under this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph 
        precludes the Administrator from implementing or enforcing any 
        applicable provision of a plan promulgated under this 
        subsection.
          (4) Bridge use charges.--
                  (A) Elimination.--Any measure in an applicable 
                implementation plan that requires a toll or other 
                charge for the use of a bridge located entirely within 
                1 city shall be eliminated from the plan by the 
                Administrator on application by the Governor of the 
                State, which application shall include a certification 
                by the Governor that the Governor will revise the plan 
                in accordance with subparagraph (B).
                  (B) Plan revision.--In the case of any applicable 
                implementation plan with respect to which a measure has 
                been eliminated under subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) the plan shall be revised to include 
                        comprehensive measures to--
                                  (I) establish, expand, or improve 
                                public transportation measures to meet 
                                basic transportation needs, as 
                                expeditiously as is practicable; and
                                  (II) implement transportation control 
                                measures necessary to attain and 
                                maintain NAAQSes; and
                          (ii) the revised plan shall, for the purpose 
                        of implementing those comprehensive public 
                        transportation measures, include requirements 
                        to use (insofar as is necessary) Federal 
                        grants, State or local funds, or any 
                        combination of such grants and funds as may be 
                        consistent with the terms of the legislation 
                        providing the grants and funds.
                  (C) Emission reductions equivalent.--The measures 
                under subparagraph (B)(i) shall, as a substitute for 
                the tolls or charges eliminated under subparagraph (A), 
                provide for emission reductions equivalent to the 
                reductions that may reasonably be expected to be 
                achieved through the use of the tolls or charges 
                eliminated.
                  (D) Coordination.--Any revision of an implementation 
                plan for purposes of meeting the requirements of 
                subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be submitted in 
                coordination with any plan revision required under 
                chapter 215.
  (d) Temporary Emergency Suspensions on Determination by the President 
of a National or Regional Energy Emergency.--
          (1) Determination by the president.--On application by the 
        owner or operator of a fuel burning stationary source, and 
        after notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Governor 
        of the State in which the source is located may petition the 
        President to determine that a national or regional energy 
        emergency exists of such severity that--
                  (A) a temporary suspension of any part of the 
                applicable implementation plan or of any requirement 
                under section 233110 of this title may be necessary; 
                and
                  (B) other means of responding to the energy emergency 
                may be inadequate.
          (2) Nondelegability.--A determination under paragraph (1) 
        shall not be delegable by the President to any other person.
          (3) Temporary emergency suspensions.--
                  (A) In general.--If the President determines that a 
                national or regional energy emergency of the severity 
                described in paragraph (1) exists, a temporary 
                emergency suspension of any part of an applicable 
                implementation plan or of any requirement under section 
                233110 of this title adopted by the State may be issued 
                by the Governor of any State covered by the President's 
                determination under the condition specified in 
                subparagraph (B) and may take effect immediately.
                  (B) Condition.--A temporary emergency suspension 
                under subparagraph (A) shall be issued to a source only 
                if the Governor of the State finds that--
                          (i) there exists in the vicinity of the 
                        source a temporary energy emergency involving 
                        high levels of unemployment or loss of 
                        necessary energy supplies for residential 
                        dwellings; and
                          (ii) such unemployment or loss can be totally 
                        or partially alleviated by the emergency 
                        suspension.
                  (C) Limitation.--Not more than 1 temporary emergency 
                suspension may be issued for any source on the basis of 
                the same set of circumstances or on the basis of the 
                same emergency.
                  (D) Effective period.--A temporary emergency 
                suspension shall remain in effect for a maximum of--
                          (i) 4 months; or
                          (ii) such lesser period as may be specified 
                        in a disapproval order of the Administrator, if 
                        any.
                  (E) Disapproval by the administrator.--The 
                Administrator may disapprove a temporary emergency 
                suspension if the Administrator determines that it does 
                not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C).
          (4) Applicability.--This subsection shall not apply in the 
        case of a plan provision or requirement promulgated by the 
        Administrator under subsection (c), but in any such case the 
        President may grant a temporary emergency suspension for a 4-
        month period of any such provision or requirement if the 
        President makes the determinations and findings specified in 
        paragraph (1) and subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3).
  (e) Temporary Emergency Suspensions by a Governor To Prevent Closing 
of a Source.--
          (1) In general.--In the case of any State that has adopted 
        and submitted to the Administrator a proposed plan revision 
        that--
                  (A) the State determines--
                          (i) meets the requirements of this section; 
                        and
                          (ii) is necessary--
                                  (I) to prevent the closing for 1 year 
                                or more of any source of air pollution; 
                                and
                                  (II) to prevent substantial increases 
                                in unemployment that would result from 
                                such a closing; and
                  (B) the Administrator has not approved or disapproved 
                under this section within 12 months of submission of 
                the proposed plan revision;
        the Governor may issue a temporary emergency suspension of the 
        part of the applicable implementation plan for the State that 
        is proposed to be revised with respect to that source.
          (2) Determination under paragraph (1)(a)(ii).--A 
        determination under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) may not be made with 
        respect to a source that would close without regard to whether 
        or not the proposed plan revision is approved.
          (3) Effective period.--A temporary emergency suspension 
        issued by a Governor under this subsection shall remain in 
        effect for a maximum of--
                  (A) 4 months; or
                  (B) such lesser period as may be specified in a 
                disapproval order of the Administrator.
          (4) Disapproval by the administrator.--The Administrator may 
        disapprove a temporary emergency suspension if the 
        Administrator determines that it does not meet the requirements 
        of this subsection.
  (f) Comprehensive Documents Setting Forth Requirements of Applicable 
Implementation Plans.--
          (1) In general.--Every 3 years, the Administrator shall 
        assemble and publish a comprehensive document for each State 
        setting forth all requirements of the applicable implementation 
        plan for the State and shall publish notice in the Federal 
        Register of the availability of such documents.
          (2) Regulations.--The Administrator may promulgate such 
        regulations as may be reasonably necessary to carry out this 
        subsection.
  (g) No Modification of Implementation Plan Requirements.--Except for 
a suspension under subsection (d) or (e), an exemption under section 
211118 of this title, a plan promulgation under subsection (c), or a 
plan revision under subsection (a)(4), no order, suspension, plan 
revision, or other action modifying any requirement of an applicable 
implementation plan may be taken with respect to any stationary source 
by a State or by the Administrator.
  (h) Technological Systems of Continuous Emission Reduction on New or 
Modified Stationary Sources; Compliance With Requirements.--As a 
condition for issuance of any permit required under this subdivision, 
the owner or operator of each new or modified stationary source that is 
required to obtain such a permit shall show to the satisfaction of the 
permitting authority that--
          (1) the technological system of continuous emission reduction 
        that is to be used at the source will enable the source to 
        comply with the standards of performance that are to apply to 
        the source; and
          (2) the construction or modification and operation of the 
        source will be in compliance with all other requirements of 
        this division.
  (i) EPA Action on Plan Submissions.--
          (1) Completeness of plan submissions.--
                  (A) Completeness criteria.--The Administrator shall 
                promulgate minimum criteria that any plan submission 
                shall meet before the Administrator is required to act 
                on the submission under this subsection. The criteria 
                shall be limited to the information necessary to enable 
                the Administrator to determine whether the plan 
                submission complies with this division.
                  (B) Completeness finding.--Within 60 days after the 
                Administrator's receipt of a plan or plan revision, but 
                not later than 6 months after the date, if any, by 
                which a State is required to submit the plan or 
                revision, the Administrator shall determine whether the 
                minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph 
                (A) have been met. Any plan or plan revision that a 
                State submits to the Administrator, and that has not 
                been determined by the Administrator (by the date that 
                is 6 months after receipt of the submission) to have 
                failed to meet the minimum criteria established 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall on that date be 
                deemed by operation of law to meet the minimum 
                criteria.
                  (C) Effect of finding of incompleteness.--Where the 
                Administrator determines that a plan submission (or 
                part thereof) does not meet the minimum criteria 
                established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the State 
                shall be treated as not having made the submission (or, 
                in the Administrator's discretion, part thereof).
          (2) Deadline for action.--Within 12 months after a 
        determination by the Administrator (or a determination deemed 
        by operation of law) under paragraph (1) that a State has 
        submitted a plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator's 
        discretion, part thereof) that meets the minimum criteria 
        established pursuant to paragraph (1), if applicable (or, if 
        those criteria are not applicable, within 12 months after 
        submission of the plan or revision), the Administrator shall 
        act on the submission in accordance with paragraph (3).
          (3) Full and partial approval and disapproval.--In the case 
        of any submittal on which the Administrator is required to act 
        under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall approve the 
        submittal as a whole if it meets all of the applicable 
        requirements of this division. If a portion of the plan 
        revision meets all the applicable requirements of this 
        division, the Administrator may approve the plan revision in 
        part and disapprove the plan revision in part. The plan 
        revision shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of 
        this division until the Administrator approves the entire plan 
        revision as complying with the applicable requirements of this 
        division.
          (4) Conditional approval.--The Administrator may approve a 
        plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt 
        specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later 
        than 1 year after the date of approval of the plan revision. 
        Any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval 
        if the State fails to comply with the commitment.
          (5) Calls for plan revisions.--
                  (A) In general.--Whenever the Administrator finds 
                that the applicable implementation plan for any area is 
                substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the 
                relevant NAAQS, to mitigate adequately the interstate 
                pollutant transport described in section 215108 of this 
                title or section 215205 of this title, or to otherwise 
                comply with any requirement of this division, the 
                Administrator shall require the State to revise the 
                plan as necessary to correct such inadequacies.
                  (B) Notice; deadlines.--The Administrator--
                          (i) shall notify the State of the 
                        inadequacies; and
                          (ii) may establish reasonable deadlines (not 
                        to exceed 18 months after the date of the 
                        notice) for the submission of the plan 
                        revisions.
                  (C) Public availability.--The findings under 
                subparagraph (A) and notice under subparagraph (B) 
                shall be public.
                  (D) Effect of finding.--Any finding under this 
                paragraph shall, to the extent that the Administrator 
                considers appropriate, subject the State to the 
                requirements of this division to which the State was 
                subject when it developed and submitted the plan for 
                which the finding was made, except that the 
                Administrator may adjust any dates applicable under 
                those requirements as appropriate (except that the 
                Administrator may not adjust any attainment date 
                prescribed under chapter 215 unless that date has 
                elapsed).
          (6) Corrections.--Whenever the Administrator determines that 
        the Administrator's action approving, disapproving, or 
        promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part thereof), area 
        designation, redesignation, classification, or reclassification 
        was in error, the Administrator may in the same manner as the 
        approval, disapproval, or promulgation revise the action as 
        appropriate without requiring any further submission from the 
        State. Such a determination and the basis thereof shall be 
        provided to the State and public.
  (j) Plan Revisions.--Each revision to an implementation plan 
submitted by a State under this division shall be adopted by the State 
after reasonable notice and public hearing. The Administrator shall not 
approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with any 
applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further 
progress (as defined in section 215101 of this title) or any other 
applicable requirement of this division.
  (k) Sanctions.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may apply any of the 
        sanctions listed in section 215111(b) of this title at any time 
        (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, 
        disapproval, or determination under subparagraphs (A) through 
        (D), respectively, of section 215111(a)(1) of this title in 
        relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by 
        the Administrator) required under this division, with respect 
        to any portion of the State that the Administrator determines 
        to be reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of ensuring 
        that the requirements of this division relating to the plan or 
        plan item are met.
          (2) Criteria.--The Administrator shall, by regulation, 
        establish criteria for exercising the Administrator's authority 
        under paragraph (1) with respect to any deficiency described in 
        section 215111(a)(1) of this title to ensure that, during the 
        24-month period following the finding, disapproval, or 
        determination described in section 215111(a)(1) of this title, 
        the sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where 1 or 
        more political subdivisions covered by the applicable 
        implementation plan are principally responsible for the 
        deficiency.
  (l) Savings Provisions.--
          (1) Existing plan provisions.--Any provision of any 
        applicable implementation plan that was approved or promulgated 
        by the Administrator pursuant to section 110 of the Clean Air 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 7410) (as in effect before November 15, 1990) 
        shall remain in effect as part of the applicable implementation 
        plan, except to the extent that a revision to the provision is 
        approved or promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to this 
        division.
          (2) Attainment dates.--For any area not designated 
        nonattainment, any plan or plan revision submitted or required 
        to be submitted by a State--
                  (A) in response to the promulgation or revision of a 
                primary NAAQS in effect on November 15, 1990; or
                  (B) in response to a finding of substantial 
                inadequacy under section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act 
                (42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)) (as in effect before November 
                15, 1990);
        shall provide for attainment of the primary NAAQSes within 5 
        years after issuance of the finding of substantial inadequacy.
          (3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain areas.--
        In the case of an area to which, as of November 14, 1990, the 
        prohibition on construction or modification of major stationary 
        sources prescribed in section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(I)) (as in effect before November 15, 
        1990) applied by virtue of a finding of the Administrator that 
        the State containing that area had not submitted an 
        implementation plan meeting the requirements of section 
        172(b)(6) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7502(b)(6)) (as in 
        effect before November 15, 1990) or section 172(a)(1) of the 
        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7502(a)(1)) (to the extent that those 
        requirements relate to provision for attainment of the primary 
        NAAQS for sulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) (as in effect 
        before November 15, 1990), no major stationary source of the 
        relevant air pollutant or pollutants shall be constructed or 
        modified in the area until the Administrator finds that the 
        plan for the area meets the applicable requirements of section 
        215102(c)(5) of this title or subchapter V of chapter 215, 
        respectively.
  (m) Indian Tribes.--
          (1) Review of implementation plan.--If an Indian tribe 
        submits an implementation plan to the Administrator pursuant to 
        section 203101(d) of this title, the plan shall be reviewed in 
        accordance with the provisions for review set forth in this 
        section for State plans, except as otherwise provided by 
        regulation promulgated pursuant to section 203101(d)(2) of this 
        title.
          (2) Applicability of implementation plan.--When an 
        implementation plan described in paragraph (1) becomes 
        effective in accordance with the regulations promulgated under 
        section 203101(d) of this title, the plan shall become 
        applicable to all areas (except as expressly provided otherwise 
        in the plan) located within the exterior boundaries of the 
        reservation, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent and 
        including rights-of-way running through the reservation.
  (n) Reports.--Any State shall submit, according to such schedule as 
the Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the Administrator may 
require relating to--
          (1) emission reductions;
          (2) vehicle miles traveled;
          (3) congestion levels; and
          (4) any other information that the Administrator considers 
        necessary to assess the development, effectiveness, need for 
        revision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision 
        required under this division.
Sec. 211111. Standards of performance for new stationary sources
  (a) Definitions.--In this section:
          (1) Existing source.--The term ``existing source'' means any 
        stationary source other than a new source.
          (2) Modify.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``modify'', with respect to 
                a stationary source, means to make or undergo any 
                physical change in, or change in the method of 
                operation of, the stationary source that--
                          (i) increases the amount of any air pollutant 
                        emitted by the stationary source; or
                          (ii) results in the emission of any air 
                        pollutant not previously emitted.
                  (B) Exclusion.--The term ``modify'' does not include 
                converting to coal by reason of an order under section 
                2(a) of the Energy Supply and Environmental 
                Coordination Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 792(a)) or any 
                enactment that supersedes that Act.
          (3) New source.--The term ``new source'' means any stationary 
        source, the construction or modification of which is commenced 
        after the publication of regulations (or, if earlier, proposed 
        regulations) prescribing a standard of performance under this 
        section that will be applicable to the source.
          (4) Owner or operator.--The term ``owner or operator'' means 
        any person that owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises 
        a stationary source.
          (5) Standard of performance.--The term ``standard of 
        performance'' means a standard for emissions of air pollutants 
        that reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable 
        through the application of the best system of emission 
        reduction that (taking into account the cost of achieving the 
        reduction and any non-air-quality health and environmental 
        impact and energy requirements) the Administrator determines 
        has been adequately demonstrated.
          (6) Stationary source.--The term ``stationary source'' means 
        any building, structure, facility, or installation that emits 
        or may emit any air pollutant.
          (7) Technological system of continuous emission reduction.--
        The term ``technological system of continuous emission 
        reduction'' means--
                  (A) a technological process for production or 
                operation by any source that is inherently low-
                polluting or nonpolluting; or
                  (B) a technological system for continuous reduction 
                of the pollution generated by a source before the 
                pollution is emitted into the ambient air, including 
                precombustion cleaning or treatment of fuel.
  (b) Standards of Performance.--
          (1) List of categories.--The Administrator shall publish (and 
        from time to time revise) a list of categories of stationary 
        sources. The Administrator shall include a category of sources 
        in the list if in the Administrator's judgment it causes, or 
        contributes significantly to, air pollution that may reasonably 
        be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.
          (2) Regulations.--Within 1 year after the inclusion of a 
        category of stationary sources in a list under paragraph (1), 
        the Administrator shall publish proposed regulations 
        establishing Federal standards of performance for new sources 
        within the category. The Administrator shall afford interested 
        persons an opportunity for written comment on the proposed 
        regulations. After considering the comments, the Administrator 
        shall promulgate, within 1 year after publication of the 
        proposed regulations, the standard of performance with such 
        modifications as the Administrator considers appropriate.
          (3) Periodic review.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall, at least 
                every 8 years, review and, if appropriate, revise the 
                standard of performance following the procedure 
                required by this subsection for promulgation of 
                standards of performance.
                  (B) Readily available information.--Notwithstanding 
                subparagraph (A), the Administrator need not review any 
                standard of performance if the Administrator determines 
                that review is not appropriate in light of readily 
                available information on the efficacy of the standard 
                of performance.
          (4) Effective date.--A standard of performance or revision 
        thereof shall become effective on promulgation.
          (5) Consideration of emission limitations and percent 
        reductions achieved in practice.--When implementation and 
        enforcement of any requirement of this division indicate that 
        emission limitations and percent reductions beyond those 
        required by the standard of performance promulgated under this 
        section are achieved in practice, the Administrator shall, when 
        revising the standard of performance promulgated under this 
        section, consider the emission limitations and percent 
        reductions achieved in practice.
          (6) Classes, types, and sizes.--The Administrator may 
        distinguish among classes, types, and sizes within categories 
        of new sources for the purpose of establishing standards of 
        performance.
          (7) Pollution control techniques.--The Administrator shall 
        from time to time issue information on pollution control 
        techniques for categories of new sources and air pollutants 
        subject to this section.
          (8) New sources owned or operated by the united states.--This 
        section shall apply to any new source owned or operated by the 
        United States.
          (9) Effect of section.--Except as otherwise authorized under 
        subsection (f), nothing in this section shall be construed to 
        require, or to authorize the Administrator to require, any new 
        or modified source to install and operate any particular 
        technological system of continuous emission reduction to comply 
        with any new source standard of performance.
          (10) Certain new or modified fossil fuel-fired stationary 
        sources.--Any new or modified fossil fuel-fired stationary 
        source that commences construction prior to the date of 
        publication of proposed revised standards shall not be required 
        to comply with those revised standards.
  (c) State Implementation and Enforcement of Standards of 
Performance.--
          (1) Delegation of authority.--Each State may develop and 
        submit to the Administrator a procedure for implementing and 
        enforcing standards of performance for new sources located in 
        the State. If the Administrator finds that the State procedure 
        is adequate, the Administrator shall delegate to the State any 
        authority that the Administrator has under this division to 
        implement and enforce the standards of performance.
          (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection 
        prohibits the Administrator from enforcing any applicable 
        standard of performance under this section.
  (d) Standards of Performance Established by States for Existing 
Sources.--
          (1) Regulations.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall prescribe 
                regulations that establish a procedure similar to that 
                provided by section 211110 of this title under which 
                each State shall submit to the Administrator a plan 
                that--
                          (i) establishes standards of performance for 
                        any existing source for any air pollutant--
                                  (I)(aa) for which air quality 
                                criteria have not been issued; or
                                  (bb) that is not included on a list 
                                published under section 211108(a) of 
                                this title or emitted from a source 
                                category that is regulated under 
                                section 211112 of this title; but
                                  (II) to which a standard of 
                                performance under this section would 
                                apply if the existing source were a new 
                                source; and
                          (ii) provides for the implementation and 
                        enforcement of the standards of performance.
                  (B) Considerations.--The regulations under this 
                paragraph shall permit a State in applying a standard 
                of performance to any particular source under a plan 
                submitted under this paragraph to take into 
                consideration, among other factors, the remaining 
                useful life of the existing source to which the 
                standard of performance applies.
          (2) Authority of the administrator.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall have the 
                authority described in paragraph (1)--
                          (i) to prescribe a plan for a State in a case 
                        where the State fails to submit a satisfactory 
                        plan as the Administrator would have under 
                        section 211110(c) of this title in the case of 
                        failure to submit an implementation plan; and
                          (ii) to enforce the plan in a case where the 
                        State fails to enforce the plan as the 
                        Administrator would have under sections 211113 
                        and 211114 of this title with respect to an 
                        implementation plan.
                  (B) Considerations.--In promulgating a standard of 
                performance under a plan prescribed under this 
                paragraph, the Administrator shall take into 
                consideration, among other factors, the remaining 
                useful lives of the sources in the category of sources 
                to which the standard applies.
  (e) New Source Standards of Performance.--
          (1) In general.--For categories of major stationary sources 
        that the Administrator listed under section 111(b)(1)(A) of the 
        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411(b)(1)(A)) before November 15, 
        1990, and for which the Administrator had not proposed 
        regulations by November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall 
        promulgate regulations establishing standards of performance.
          (2) Priorities.--In determining priorities for promulgating 
        standards for categories of major stationary sources for the 
        purpose of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider--
                  (A) the quantity of air pollutant emissions that each 
                category will emit or be designed to emit;
                  (B) the extent to which each air pollutant may 
                reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or 
                welfare; and
                  (C) the mobility and competitive nature of each 
                category of sources and the consequent need for 
                nationally applicable new source standards of 
                performance.
          (3) Consultation.--Before promulgating any regulations under 
        this subsection or listing any category of major stationary 
        sources as required under this subsection, the Administrator 
        shall consult with appropriate representatives of the Governors 
        and of State air pollution control agencies.
          (4) Revision of regulations.--
                  (A) Specification of category listed.--On application 
                by the Governor of a State showing that the 
                Administrator has failed to specify in regulations 
                under paragraph (1) any category of major stationary 
                sources required to be specified under the regulations, 
                the Administrator shall revise the regulations to 
                specify any such category.
                  (B) Specification of category not listed.--On 
                application of the Governor of a State showing that any 
                category of stationary sources not included in the list 
                under section 111(b)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act (42 
                U.S.C. 7411(b)(1)(A)) before November 15, 1990, 
                contributes significantly to air pollution that may 
                reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or 
                welfare (notwithstanding that that category is not a 
                category of major stationary sources), the 
                Administrator shall revise the regulations to specify 
                that category of stationary sources.
                  (C) Proper application of criteria.--On application 
                of the Governor of a State showing that the 
                Administrator has failed to apply properly the criteria 
                required to be considered under paragraph (2), the 
                Administrator shall revise the list under subsection 
                (b)(1) to apply properly the criteria.
                  (D) New, innovative, or improved technology or 
                process.--On application of the Governor of a State 
                showing that--
                          (i) a new, innovative, or improved technology 
                        or process that achieves greater continuous 
                        emission reduction has been adequately 
                        demonstrated for any category of stationary 
                        sources; and
                          (ii) as a result of that technology or 
                        process, the new source standard of performance 
                        in effect under this section for that category 
                        no longer reflects the greatest degree of 
                        emission limitation achievable through 
                        application of the best technological system of 
                        continuous emission reduction that (taking into 
                        consideration the cost of achieving such an 
                        emission reduction, and any non-air-quality 
                        health and environmental impact and energy 
                        requirements) has been adequately demonstrated,
                the Administrator shall revise the standard of 
                performance for that category accordingly.
                  (E) Deadline.--Unless later deadlines for action of 
                the Administrator are otherwise prescribed under this 
                section, the Administrator shall, not later than 3 
                months after the date of receipt of any application by 
                a Governor of a State--
                          (i) find that the application does not 
                        contain the requisite showing and deny the 
                        application; or
                          (ii) grant the application and take the 
                        action required under this subsection.
          (5) Notice and opportunity for public hearing.--Before taking 
        any action required by this subsection, the Administrator shall 
        provide notice and opportunity for public hearing.
  (f) Design, Equipment, Work Practice, or Operational Standard if 
Standard of Performance Is Not Feasible.--
          (1) In general.--If, in the judgment of the Administrator, it 
        is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a standard of 
        performance, the Administrator may instead promulgate a design, 
        equipment, work practice, or operational standard (or 
        combination thereof) that reflects the best technological 
        system of continuous emission reduction that (taking into 
        consideration the cost of achieving the emission reduction, and 
        any non-air-quality health and environmental impact and energy 
        requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately 
        demonstrated.
          (2) Operation and maintenance.--The Administrator shall 
        include as part of any design or equipment standard promulgated 
        under this subsection such requirements as will ensure the 
        proper operation and maintenance of any such element of design 
        or equipment.
          (3) Standard of performance not feasible.--For the purpose of 
        this subsection, the Administrator may determine that it is not 
        feasible to prescribe or enforce a standard of performance in 
        any situation in which the Administrator determines that--
                  (A) a pollutant or pollutants cannot be emitted 
                through a conveyance designed and constructed to emit 
                or capture pollutant, or any requirement for, or use 
                of, such a conveyance would be inconsistent with 
                Federal, State, or local law; or
                  (B) the application of measurement methodology to a 
                particular class of sources is not practicable due to 
                technological or economic limitations.
          (4) Alternative means of emission limitation.--If, after 
        notice and opportunity for public hearing, any person 
        establishes to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an 
        alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a 
        reduction in emissions of any air pollutant at least equivalent 
        to the reduction in emissions of that air pollutant achieved 
        under a design, equipment, work practice, or operational 
        standard promulgated under paragraph (1), the Administrator 
        shall permit the use of the alternative by the source for 
        purposes of compliance with this section with respect to that 
        pollutant.
          (5) Promulgation of standard of performance when feasible.--
        Any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard 
        promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be promulgated in terms 
        of a standard of performance whenever it becomes feasible to 
        promulgate and enforce the design, equipment, work practice, or 
        operational standard in terms of a standard of performance.
          (6) Treatment.--Any design, equipment, work practice, or 
        operational standard, or any combination thereof, described in 
        this subsection shall be treated as a standard of performance 
        for purposes of this division (except subsection (a) and this 
        subsection).
  (g) Country Elevators.--Any regulations promulgated by the 
Administrator under this section applicable to grain elevators shall 
not apply to country elevators (as defined by the Administrator) that 
have a storage capacity of less than 2,500,000 bushels.
  (h) Waivers To Encourage the Use of Innovative Technological Systems 
of Continuous Emission Reduction.--
          (1) Request for waiver.--Any person proposing to own or 
        operate a new source may request the Administrator for 1 or 
        more waivers from the requirements of this section for the 
        source or any portion thereof with respect to any air pollutant 
        to encourage the use of 1 or more innovative technological 
        systems of continuous emission reduction.
          (2) Grant of waiver.--The Administrator may, with the consent 
        of the Governor of the State in which the source is to be 
        located, grant a waiver under paragraph (1) if the 
        Administrator determines, after notice and opportunity for 
        public hearing, that--
                  (A) the proposed system or systems have not been 
                adequately demonstrated;
                  (B)(i) the proposed system or systems will operate 
                effectively; and
                  (ii) there is a substantial likelihood that the 
                system or systems will achieve--
                          (I) greater continuous emission reduction 
                        than that required to be achieved under the 
                        standards of performance that would otherwise 
                        apply; or
                          (II) at least an equivalent reduction at 
                        lower cost in terms of energy, economic, or 
                        non-air-quality environmental impact;
                  (C) the owner or operator of the proposed source has 
                demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator 
                that the proposed system will not cause or contribute 
                to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or 
                safety in its operation, function, or malfunction; and
                  (D) the granting of the waiver is consistent with 
                paragraph (6).
          (3) Likelihood of greater continuous emission reduction.--In 
        making any determination under paragraph (2)(B), the 
        Administrator shall take into account any previous failure of 
        the system or systems to operate effectively or to meet any 
        requirement of the new source performance standards.
          (4) Risk to public health, welfare, or safety.--
                  (A) Considerations.--In determining whether an 
                unreasonable risk exists under paragraph (2)(C), the 
                Administrator shall consider, among other factors--
                          (i) whether and to what extent the use of the 
                        proposed technological system will cause, 
                        increase, reduce, or eliminate emissions of any 
                        unregulated pollutants;
                          (ii) available methods for reducing or 
                        eliminating any risk to public health, welfare, 
                        or safety that may be associated with the use 
                        of the system; and
                          (iii) the availability of other technological 
                        systems that may be used to conform to 
                        standards under this section without causing or 
                        contributing to an unreasonable risk.
                  (B) Tests; information.--The Administrator may 
                conduct such tests and require the owner or operator of 
                the proposed source to conduct such tests and provide 
                such information as is necessary to carry out paragraph 
                (2)(C). Such requirements shall include a requirement 
                for prompt reporting of the emission of any unregulated 
                pollutant from a system if the pollutant was not 
                emitted, or was emitted in significantly lesser 
                amounts, without use of the system.
          (5) Terms and conditions.--
                  (A) In general.--A waiver under paragraph (5) shall 
                be granted on such terms and conditions as the 
                Administrator determines to be necessary to--
                          (i) ensure that emissions from the source 
                        will not prevent attainment and maintenance of 
                        any NAAQSes; and
                          (ii) ensure the proper functioning of the 
                        technological system or systems authorized.
                  (B) Treatment as standard of performance.--Any such 
                term or condition shall be treated as a standard of 
                performance for the purposes of subsection (j) and 
                section 211113 of this title.
          (6) Number of waivers.--The number of waivers granted under 
        this subsection with respect to a proposed technological system 
        of continuous emission reduction shall not exceed such number 
        as the Administrator finds necessary to ascertain whether or 
        not the system will achieve the conditions specified in 
        subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2).
          (7) Effective period.--
                  (A) In general.--A waiver under paragraph (1) shall 
                extend to the earlier of--
                          (i) a date determined by the Administrator, 
                        after consultation with the owner or operator 
                        of the source, taking into consideration the 
                        design, installation, and capital cost of the 
                        technological system or systems being used; or
                          (ii) the date on which the Administrator 
                        determines that--
                                  (I) the system has failed to--
                                          (aa) achieve at least an 
                                        equivalent continuous emission 
                                        reduction to that required to 
                                        be achieved under the standards 
                                        of performance that would 
                                        otherwise apply; or
                                          (bb) comply with the 
                                        condition specified in 
                                        paragraph (2)(C); and
                                  (II) the failure cannot be corrected.
                  (B) Date determined by the administrator.--In 
                carrying out subparagraph (A)(i), the Administrator 
                shall not permit any waiver for a source or portion 
                thereof to extend beyond the earlier of--
                          (i) years after the date on which any waiver 
                        is granted to the source or portion thereof; or
                          (ii) the date that is 4 years after the date 
                        on which the source or portion thereof 
                        commences operation.
          (8) Portion of source to which waiver applies.--No waiver 
        under paragraph (1) shall apply to any portion of a source 
        other than the portion on which the innovative technological 
        system or systems of continuous emission reduction are used.
          (9) Extension.--
                  (A) In general.--If a waiver for a source is 
                terminated under paragraph (7)(A)(ii), the 
                Administrator shall grant an extension of the 
                requirements of this section for the source for such 
                minimum period as may be necessary to comply with the 
                applicable standard of performance under this section. 
                That period shall not extend beyond the date that is 3 
                years after the date on which the waiver is terminated.
                  (B) Emission limits and compliance schedule.--
                          (i) In general.--An extension granted under 
                        this paragraph shall--
                                  (I) set forth emission limits and a 
                                compliance schedule containing 
                                increments of progress that require 
                                compliance with the applicable 
                                standards of performance as 
                                expeditiously as practicable; and
                                  (II) include such measures as are

                on the health or environmental effects of the pollutant 
                or other evidence adequate to support the petition.
                  (B) Action by the administrator.--Within 18 months 
                after receipt of a petition, the Administrator shall 
                grant or deny the petition by publishing a written 
                explanation of the reasons for the Administrator's 
                decision. The Administrator may not deny a petition 
                solely on the basis of inadequate resources or time for 
                review.
                  (C) Addition of substance.--The Administrator shall 
                add a substance to the list on a showing by the 
                petitioner or on the Administrator's own determination 
                that--
                          (i) the substance is an air pollutant; and
                          (ii) emissions, ambient concentrations, 
                        bioaccumulation, or deposition of the substance 
                        are known to cause or may reasonably be 
                        anticipated to cause adverse effects on human 
                        health or adverse environmental effects.
                  (D) Deletion from list.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        delete a substance from the list on a showing 
                        by the petitioner or on the Administrator's own 
                        determination that there are adequate data on 
                        the health and environmental effects of the 
                        substance to determine that emissions, ambient 
                        concentrations, bioaccumulation, or deposition 
                        of the substance may not reasonably be 
                        anticipated to cause any adverse effects on 
                        human health or adverse environmental effects.
                          (ii) Certain unique chemical substances that 
                        contain a listed hazardous air pollutant not 
                        having a cas number.--The Administrator shall 
                        delete from the list 1 or more unique chemical 
                        substances that contain a listed hazardous air 
                        pollutant not having a CAS number (other than 
                        coke oven emissions, mineral fibers, or 
                        polycyclic organic matter) on a showing by the 
                        petitioner or on the Administrator's own 
                        determination that the unique chemical 
                        substances that contain the named chemical of 
                        the listed hazardous air pollutant meet the 
                        deletion requirements of clause (i).
          (4) Further information.--If the Administrator determines 
        that information on the health or environmental effects of a 
        substance is not sufficient to make a determination required by 
        this subsection, the Administrator may use any authority 
        available to the Administrator to acquire such information.
          (5) Test methods.--The Administrator may establish, by 
        regulation, test measures and other analytic procedures for 
        monitoring and measuring emissions, ambient concentrations, 
        deposition, and bioaccumulation of hazardous air pollutants.
          (6) Prevention of significant deterioration.--Chapter 213 
        shall not apply to a pollutant listed under this section.
          (7) Lead.--The Administrator may not list elemental lead as a 
        hazardous air pollutant under this subsection.
  (c) List of Source Categories.--
          (1) Publication and revision.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish, and 
                shall from time to time, but not less often than every 
                8 years, revise, if appropriate, in response to public 
                comment or new information, a list of all categories 
                and subcategories of major sources and area sources 
                (listed under paragraph (3)) of the air pollutants 
                listed pursuant to subsection (b).
                  (B) Consistency.--
                          (i) In general.--To the extent practicable, 
                        the categories and subcategories listed under 
                        this subsection shall be consistent with the 
                        list of source categories established pursuant 
                        to section 211111 of this title and chapter 
                        213.
                          (ii) Effect.--Nothing in clause (i) limits 
                        the Administrator's authority to establish 
                        subcategories under this section, as 
                        appropriate.
          (2) Requirement for emission standards.--For the categories 
        and subcategories that the Administrator lists, the 
        Administrator shall establish emission standards under 
        subsection (d), according to the schedule in this subsection 
        and subsection (e).
          (3) Area sources.--The Administrator shall list under this 
        subsection each category or subcategory of area sources that 
        the Administrator finds presents a threat of adverse effects on 
        human health or the environment (by such sources individually 
        or in the aggregate) warranting regulation under this section. 
        The Administrator shall, pursuant to subsection (j)(3)(B), 
        list, based on actual or estimated aggregate emissions of a 
        listed pollutant or pollutants, sufficient categories or 
        subcategories of area sources to ensure that area sources 
        representing 90 percent of the area source emissions of the 30 
        hazardous air pollutants that present the greatest threat to 
        public health in the largest number of urban areas are subject 
        to regulation under this section.
          (4) Previously regulated sources.--The Administrator may list 
        any category or subcategory of sources regulated under section 
        112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) (as in effect before 
        November 15, 1990).
          (5) Additional categories.--In addition to the categories and 
        subcategories of sources listed for regulation pursuant to 
        paragraphs (1) and (3), the Administrator may at any time list 
        additional categories and subcategories of sources of hazardous 
        air pollutants according to the criteria for listing applicable 
        under those paragraphs. In the case of source categories and 
        subcategories listed after publication of the initial list 
        required under paragraph (1) or (3), emission standards under 
        subsection (d) for the category or subcategory shall be 
        promulgated within 2 years after the date on which the category 
        or subcategory is listed.
          (6) Specific pollutants.--
                  (A) In general.--With respect to alkylated lead 
                compounds, polycyclic organic matter, 
                hexachlorobenzene, mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, 
                2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofurans, and 2,3,7,8-
                tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the Administrator shall 
                list categories and subcategories of sources ensuring 
                that sources accounting for not less than 90 percent of 
                the aggregate emissions of each such pollutant are 
                subject to standards under paragraph (2) or (4) of 
                subsection (d).
                  (B) Effect of paragraph.--This paragraph shall not be 
                construed to require the Administrator to promulgate 
                standards for pollutants described in subparagraph (A) 
                emitted by electric utility steam generating units.
          (7) Research or laboratory facilities.--
                  (A) Definition of research or laboratory facility.--
                In this paragraph, the term ``research or laboratory 
                facility'' means a stationary source the primary 
                purpose of which is to conduct research and development 
                into a new process or products, where if the source--
                          (i) is operated under the close supervision 
                        of technically trained personnel; and
                          (ii) is not engaged in the manufacture of a 
                        product for commercial sale in commerce, except 
                        in a de minimis manner.
                  (B) Separate category.--The Administrator shall 
                establish a separate category covering research or 
                laboratory facilities as necessary to ensure the 
                equitable treatment of such facilities.
          (8) Boat manufacturing.--When establishing emission standards 
        for styrene, the Administrator shall list boat manufacturing as 
        a separate subcategory unless the Administrator finds that such 
        a listing would be inconsistent with the goals and requirements 
        of this division.
          (9) Deletion from list.--
                  (A) Unique chemical substances.--Where the sole 
                reason for the inclusion of a source category on the 
                list required under this subsection is the emission of 
                a unique chemical substance, the Administrator shall 
                delete the source category from the list if it is 
                appropriate because of action taken under subsection 
                (b)(3)(D).
                  (B) Any source category.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator may delete 
                        any source category from the list under this 
                        subsection, on petition of any person or on the 
                        Administrator's own motion, whenever the 
                        Administrator makes the following determination 
                        or determinations, as applicable:
                                  (I) In the case of hazardous air 
                                pollutants emitted by sources in the 
                                category that may result in cancer in 
                                humans, a determination that no source 
                                in the category (or group of sources in 
                                the case of area sources) emits such 
                                hazardous air pollutants in quantities 
                                that may cause a lifetime risk of 
                                cancer greater than 1 in 1,000,000 to 
                                the individual in the population who is 
                                most exposed to emissions of the 
                                pollutants from the source (or group of 
                                sources in the case of an area source).
                                  (II) In the case of hazardous air 
                                pollutants that may result in adverse 
                                health effects in humans (other than 
                                cancer) or adverse environmental 
                                effects, a determination that emissions 
                                from no source in the category or 
                                subcategory (or group of sources in the 
                                case of area sources) exceed a level 
                                that is adequate to protect public 
                                health with an ample margin of safety, 
                                and no adverse environmental effect 
                                will result from emissions from any 
                                source (or from a group of sources in 
                                the case of an area source).
                          (ii) Grant or denial.--The Administrator 
                        shall grant or deny a petition under this 
                        subparagraph within 1 year after the petition 
                        is filed.
  (d) Emission Standards.--
          (1) Regulations.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                regulations establishing emission standards for each 
                category or subcategory of major sources and area 
                sources of hazardous air pollutants listed for 
                regulation pursuant to subsection (c).
                  (B) Classes, types, and sizes.--The Administrator may 
                distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources 
                within a category or subcategory in establishing the 
                emission standards, except that there shall be no delay 
                in the compliance date for any standard applicable to 
                any source under subsection (i) as the result of the 
                authority provided by this subparagraph.
          (2) Standards and methods.--
                  (A) In general.--Emission standards promulgated under 
                this subsection and applicable to new sources or 
                existing sources of hazardous air pollutants shall 
                require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of 
                hazardous air pollutants subject to this section 
                (including a prohibition on such emissions, where 
                achievable) that the Administrator, taking into 
                consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
                reduction, and any non-air-quality health and 
                environmental impacts and energy requirements, 
                determines is achievable for new sources or existing 
                sources in the category or subcategory to which the 
                emission standard applies, through application of 
                measures, processes, methods, systems or techniques, 
                including measures that--
                          (i) reduce the volume of, or eliminate 
                        emissions of, such pollutants through process 
                        changes, substitution of materials, or other 
                        modifications;
                          (ii) enclose systems or processes to 
                        eliminate emissions;
                          (iii) collect, capture, or treat such 
                        pollutants when released from a process, stack, 
                        storage, or fugitive emissions point;
                          (iv) are design, equipment, work practice, or 
                        operational standards (including requirements 
                        for operator training or certification) as 
                        provided in subsection (h); or
                          (v) are a combination of the measures 
                        described in clauses (i) through (iv).
                  (B) No compromise of intellectual property rights.--
                None of the measures described in clauses (i) through 
                (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall, consistent with section 
                211114(c) of this title, in any way compromise any 
                United States patent or United States trademark right, 
                or confidential business information, trade secret, or 
                other intellectual property right.
          (3) New sources and existing sources.--
                  (A) New sources.--The maximum degree of reduction in 
                emissions that is considered achievable for new sources 
                in a category or subcategory shall not be less 
                stringent than the emission control that is achieved in 
                practice by the best controlled similar source, as 
                determined by the Administrator.
                  (B) Existing sources.--An emission standard 
                promulgated under this subsection for existing sources 
                in a category or subcategory--
                          (i) may be less stringent than standards for 
                        new sources in the same category or 
                        subcategory; but
                          (ii) shall not be less stringent, and may be 
                        more stringent, than--
                                  (I) the average emission limitation 
                                achieved by the best performing 12 
                                percent of the existing sources (for 
                                which the Administrator has emissions 
                                information), excluding sources that 
                                have, within 18 months before the 
                                emission standard is proposed or within 
                                30 months before the emission standard 
                                is promulgated, whichever is later, 
                                first achieved a level of emission rate 
                                or emission reduction that complies, or 
                                would comply if the source is not 
                                subject to the standard, with the 
                                lowest achievable emission rate (as 
                                defined in section 215101 of this 
                                title) applicable to the source 
                                category and prevailing at the time, in 
                                the category or subcategory for 
                                categories and subcategories with 30 or 
                                more sources; or
                                  (II) the average emission limitation 
                                achieved by the best performing 5 
                                sources (for which the Administrator 
                                has or could reasonably obtain 
                                emissions information) in the category 
                                or subcategory for categories or 
                                subcategories with fewer than 30 
                                sources.
          (4) Health threshold.--With respect to pollutants for which a 
        health threshold has been established, the Administrator may 
        consider that threshold level, with an ample margin of safety, 
        when establishing emission standards under this subsection.
          (5) Alternative standard for area sources.--With respect only 
        to categories and subcategories of area sources listed pursuant 
        to subsection (c), the Administrator may, in lieu of the 
        authorities provided in paragraph (2) and subsection (f), elect 
        to promulgate standards or requirements applicable to sources 
        in categories or subcategories that provide for the use of 
        generally available control technologies or management 
        practices by those sources to reduce emissions of hazardous air 
        pollutants.
          (6) Review and revision.--The Administrator shall review, and 
        revise as necessary (taking into account developments in 
        practices, processes, and control technologies), emission 
        standards promulgated under this section not less often than 
        every 8 years.
          (7) Other requirements.--No emission standard or other 
        requirement promulgated under this section shall be 
        interpreted, construed, or applied to diminish or replace the 
        requirements of--
                  (A) a more stringent emission limitation or other 
                applicable requirement established pursuant to section 
                211111 of this title, chapter 213 or 215, or other 
                authority of this division; or
                  (B) a standard issued under State authority.
          (8) Coke ovens.--
                  (A) Regulations establishing emission standards.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        promulgate regulations establishing emission 
                        standards under paragraphs (2) and (3) for coke 
                        oven batteries.
                          (ii) Evaluations.--In establishing such 
                        standards, the Administrator shall evaluate--
                                  (I) the use of sodium silicate (or 
                                equivalent) luting compounds to prevent 
                                door leaks, and other operating 
                                practices and technologies for their 
                                effectiveness in reducing coke oven 
                                emissions, and their suitability for 
                                use on new and existing coke oven 
                                batteries, taking into account costs 
                                and reasonable commercial door 
                                warranties; and
                                  (II) as a basis for emission 
                                standards under this subsection for new 
                                coke oven batteries that begin 
                                construction after the date of proposal 
                                of the standards, the Jewell design 
                                Thompson non-recovery coke oven 
                                batteries and other non-recovery coke 
                                oven technologies, and other 
                                appropriate emission control and coke 
                                production technologies, as to their 
                                effectiveness in reducing coke oven 
                                emissions and their capability for 
                                production of steel quality coke.
                          (iii) Minimum requirements.--The regulations 
                        shall require at a minimum that coke oven 
                        batteries will not exceed 8 percent leaking 
                        doors, 1 percent leaking lids, 5 percent 
                        leaking offtakes, and 16 seconds visible 
                        emissions per charge, with no exclusion for 
                        emissions during the period after the closing 
                        of self-sealing oven doors.
                  (B) Work practice regulations.--The Administrator 
                shall promulgate work practice regulations under this 
                subsection for coke oven batteries requiring, as 
                appropriate--
                          (i) the use of sodium silicate (or 
                        equivalent) luting compounds, if the 
                        Administrator determines that use of sodium 
                        silicate is an effective means of emission 
                        control and is achievable, taking into account 
                        costs and reasonable commercial warranties for 
                        doors and related equipment; and
                          (ii) door and jam cleaning practices.
                  (C) Coke oven batteries electing to qualify for 
                compliance date extension.--For coke oven batteries 
                electing to qualify for an extension of the compliance 
                date for standards promulgated under subsection (f) in 
                accordance with subsection (i)(8), the emission 
                standards under this subsection for coke oven batteries 
                shall require that coke oven batteries not exceed--
                          (i) 8 percent leaking doors;
                          (ii) 1 percent leaking lids;
                          (iii) 5 percent leaking offtakes; and
                          (iv) 16 seconds visible emissions per charge;
                with no exclusion for emissions during the period after 
                the closing of self-sealing doors.
          (9) Sources licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission.--
        No standard for radionuclide emissions from any category or 
        subcategory of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory 
        Commission (or an Agreement State) is required to be 
        promulgated under this section if the Administrator determines, 
        by regulation, and after consultation with the Nuclear 
        Regulatory Commission, that the regulatory program established 
        by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic 
        Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) for the category or 
        subcategory provides an ample margin of safety to protect the 
        public health. Nothing in this subsection precludes or denies 
        the right of any State or political subdivision thereof to 
        adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting 
        emissions of radionuclides that is more stringent than the 
        standard or limitation in effect under section 211111 of this 
        title or this section.
          (10) Effective date.--Emission standards or other regulations 
        promulgated under this subsection shall be effective on 
        promulgation.
  (e) Priorities; Judicial Review.--
          (1) Priorities.--In determining priorities for promulgating 
        standards under subsection (d), the Administrator shall 
        consider--
                  (A) the known or anticipated adverse effects of 
                pollutants on public health and the environment;
                  (B) the quantity and location of emissions or 
                reasonably anticipated emissions of hazardous air 
                pollutants that each category or subcategory will emit; 
                and
                  (C) the efficiency of grouping categories or 
                subcategories according to the pollutants emitted, or 
                the processes or technologies used.
          (2) Judicial review.--Notwithstanding section 203102 of this 
        title, no action of the Administrator adding a pollutant to the 
        list under subsection (b) or listing a source category or 
        subcategory under subsection (c) shall be a final agency action 
        subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be 
        reviewed under section 211113 of this title when the 
        Administrator issues emission standards for such a pollutant or 
        category.
  (f) Emission Standards To Protect Health and Environment.--
          (1) Report.--The Administrator shall investigate and report, 
        after consultation with the Surgeon General and after 
        opportunity for public comment, to Congress on--
                  (A) methods of calculating the risk to public health 
                remaining, or likely to remain, from sources subject to 
                regulation under this section after the application of 
                standards under subsection (d);
                  (B) the public health significance of such estimated 
                remaining risk and the technologically and commercially 
                available methods and costs of reducing such risks;
                  (C) the actual health effects with respect to persons 
                living in the vicinity of sources, any available 
                epidemiological or other health studies, risks 
                presented by background concentrations of hazardous air 
                pollutants, any uncertainties in risk assessment 
                methodology or other health assessment technique, and 
                any negative health or environmental consequences to 
                the community of efforts to reduce such risks; and
                  (D) recommendations as to legislation regarding the 
                remaining risk.
          (2) Emission standards.--
                  (A) In general.--If Congress does not act on any 
                recommendation submitted under paragraph (1), the 
                Administrator shall, within 8 years after promulgation 
                of emission standards for each category or subcategory 
                of sources pursuant to subsection (d), promulgate 
                emission standards for the category or subcategory if 
                promulgation of emission standards is required to 
                provide an ample margin of safety to protect public 
                health in accordance with section 112 of the Clean Air 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) (as in effect before November 15, 
                1990) or to prevent, taking into consideration costs, 
                energy, safety, and other relevant factors, an adverse 
                environmental effect. Emission standards promulgated 
                under this subsection shall provide an ample margin of 
                safety to protect public health in accordance with 
                section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) (as 
                in effect before November 15, 1990), unless the 
                Administrator determines that a more stringent emission 
                standard is necessary to prevent, taking into 
                consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant 
                factors, an adverse environmental effect. If emission 
                standards promulgated pursuant to subsection (d) and 
                applicable to a category or subcategory of sources 
                emitting a pollutant (or pollutants) classified as a 
                known, probable, or possible human carcinogen do not 
                reduce lifetime excess cancer risks to the individual 
                most exposed to emissions from a source in the category 
                or subcategory to less than 1 in 1,000,000, the 
                Administrator shall promulgate emission standards under 
                this subsection for that source category.
                  (B) Effect of section.--Nothing in subparagraph (A) 
                or in any other provision of this section shall be 
                construed as affecting, or applying to the 
                Administrator's interpretation of section 112 of the 
                Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) (as in effect before 
                November 15, 1990), and set forth in the Federal 
                Register of September 14, 1989 (54 Fed. Reg. 38044).
                  (C) Deadlines.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        determine whether or not to promulgate emission 
                        standards under subparagraph (A) and, if the 
                        Administrator decides to promulgate emission 
                        standards, shall promulgate the emission 
                        standards 8 years after promulgation of the 
                        emission standards under subsection (d) for 
                        each source category or subcategory concerned.
                          (ii) Categories or subcategories for which 
                        standards under subsection (d) were required to 
                        be promulgated within 2 years after november 
                        15, 1990.--In the case of categories or 
                        subcategories for which standards under 
                        subsection (d) were required to be promulgated 
                        within 2 years after November 15, 1990, the 
                        Administrator shall have 9 years after 
                        promulgation of the emission standards under 
                        subsection (d) to make the determination under 
                        clause (i) and, if required, to promulgate the 
                        emission standards under this paragraph.
          (3) Effective date.--Any emission standard established 
        pursuant to this subsection shall become effective on 
        promulgation.
          (4) Prohibition.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), no air pollutant to which an emission standard 
                under this subsection applies may be emitted from any 
                stationary source in violation of the emission 
                standard.
                  (B) Existing sources.--In the case of an existing 
                source--
                          (i) the emission standard shall not apply 
                        until 90 days after its effective date; and
                          (ii) the Administrator may grant a waiver 
                        permitting an existing source a period of up to 
                        2 years after the effective date of an emission 
                        standard to comply with the emission standard 
                        if the Administrator finds that such a period 
                        is necessary for the installation of controls 
                        and that steps will be taken during the period 
                        of the waiver to ensure that the health of 
                        persons will be protected from imminent 
                        endangerment.
          (5) Area sources.--The Administrator is not required to 
        conduct any review under this subsection or promulgate emission 
        limitations under this subsection for any category or 
        subcategory of area sources that is listed pursuant to 
        subsection (c)(3) and for which an emission standard is 
        promulgated pursuant to subsection (d)(5).
          (6) Unique chemical substances.--In establishing emission 
        standards for the control of unique chemical substances of 
        listed pollutants without CAS numbers under this subsection, 
        the Administrator shall establish the emission standards with 
        respect to the health and environmental effects of the 
        substances actually emitted by sources and direct 
        transformation byproducts of such emissions in the categories 
        and subcategories.
  (g) Modifications.--
          (1) Offsets.--
                  (A) Change not a modification.--
                          (i) In general.--A physical change in, or 
                        change in the method of operation of, a major 
                        source that results in a greater than de 
                        minimis increase in actual emissions of a 
                        hazardous air pollutant shall not be considered 
                        a modification, if the increase in the quantity 
                        of actual emissions of any hazardous air 
                        pollutant from the source will be offset by an 
                        equal or greater decrease in the quantity of 
                        emissions of another hazardous air pollutant 
                        (or pollutants) from the source that is 
                        considered more hazardous, pursuant to guidance 
                        issued by the Administrator under subparagraph 
                        (B).
                          (ii) Showing.--The owner or operator of the 
                        source shall submit a showing to the 
                        Administrator (or the State) that an increase 
                        described in clause (i) has been offset as 
                        described in that clause.
                  (B) Guidance.--The Administrator shall, after notice 
                and opportunity for comment, publish guidance with 
                respect to implementation of this subsection. The 
                guidance shall include an identification, to the extent 
                practicable, of the relative hazard to human health 
                resulting from emissions to the ambient air of each of 
                the pollutants listed under subsection (b) sufficient 
                to facilitate the offset showing authorized by 
                subparagraph (A). The guidance shall not authorize 
                offsets between pollutants where the increased 
                pollutant (or more than 1 pollutant in a stream of 
                pollutants) causes adverse effects on human health for 
                which no safety threshold for exposure can be 
                determined unless there are corresponding decreases in 
                those types of pollutants.
          (2) Modification; construction or reconstruction.--
                  (A) Modification.--No person may modify a major 
                source of hazardous air pollutants in a State unless 
                the Administrator or the State determines that the 
                maximum achievable control technology emission 
                limitation under this section for existing sources will 
                be met. Such a determination shall be made on a case-
                by-case basis where no applicable emission limitations 
                have been established by the Administrator.
                  (B) Construction or reconstruction.--No person may 
                construct or reconstruct any major source of hazardous 
                air pollutants in a State unless the Administrator or 
                the State determines that the maximum achievable 
                control technology emission limitation under this 
                section for new sources will be met. Such a 
                determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis 
                where no applicable emission limitations have been 
                established by the Administrator.
          (3) Procedures for modification.--The Administrator (or the 
        State) shall establish reasonable procedures for ensuring that 
        the requirements applying to modifications under this section 
        are reflected in the permit.
  (h) Work Practice Standards and Other Requirements.--
          (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, if it is not 
        feasible in the judgment of the Administrator to prescribe or 
        enforce an emission standard for control of a hazardous air 
        pollutant or pollutants, the Administrator may, in lieu of 
        prescribing or enforcing an emission standard, promulgate a 
        design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or 
        combination thereof, that in the Administrator's judgment is 
        consistent with subsection (d) or (f). If the Administrator 
        promulgates a design or equipment standard under this 
        subsection, the Administrator shall include as part of the 
        design or equipment standard such requirements as will ensure 
        the proper operation and maintenance of any such element of 
        design or equipment.
          (2) Emission standard not feasible.--For the purpose of this 
        subsection, the Administrator may determine that it is not 
        feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard in any 
        situation in which the Administrator determines that--
                  (A)(i) a hazardous air pollutant or pollutants cannot 
                be emitted through a conveyance designed and 
                constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; or
                  (ii) any requirement for, or use of, such a 
                conveyance would be inconsistent with any Federal, 
                State, or local law; or
                  (B) the application of measurement methodology to a 
                particular class of sources is not practicable due to 
                technological and economic limitations.
          (3) Alternative standard.--If after notice and opportunity 
        for comment, the owner or operator of any source establishes to 
        the satisfaction of the Administrator that an alternative means 
        of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of 
        any air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction in 
        emissions of the pollutant achieved under the requirements of 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall permit the use of the 
        alternative by the source for purposes of compliance with this 
        section with respect to that pollutant.
          (4) Numerical standard.--Any standard promulgated under 
        paragraph (1) shall be promulgated in terms of an emission 
        standard whenever it is feasible to promulgate and enforce a 
        standard in such terms.
  (i) Schedule for Compliance.--
          (1) Preconstruction and operating requirements.--After the 
        effective date of any emission standard, limitation, or 
        regulation under subsection (d), (f), or (h), no person may 
        construct any new major source or reconstruct any existing 
        major source subject to the emission standard, regulation, or 
        limitation unless the Administrator (or a State with a permit 
        program approved under subdivision 6) determines that the 
        source, if properly constructed, reconstructed, and operated, 
        will comply with the standard, regulation, or limitation.
          (2) Special rule.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a new 
        source that commences construction or reconstruction after a 
        standard, limitation, or regulation applicable to the source is 
        proposed and before the standard, limitation, or regulation is 
        promulgated shall not be required to comply with the 
        promulgated standard until the date that is 3 years after the 
        date of promulgation if--
                  (A) the promulgated standard, limitation, or 
                regulation is more stringent than the standard, 
                limitation, or regulation proposed; and
                  (B) the source complies with the standard, 
                limitation, or regulation as proposed during the 3-year 
                period immediately after promulgation.
          (3) Compliance schedule for existing sources.--
                  (A) Prohibition.--After the effective date of any 
                emission standard, limitation, or regulation 
                promulgated under this section and applicable to a 
                source, no person may operate the source in violation 
                of the standard, limitation, or regulation except that, 
                in the case of an existing source, the Administrator 
                shall establish a compliance date or dates for each 
                category or subcategory of existing sources, which 
                shall provide for compliance as expeditiously as 
                practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after 
                the effective date of the standard, limitation, or 
                regulation, except as provided in subparagraph (B) and 
                paragraphs (4) through (8).
                  (B) Extension permit.--The Administrator (or a State 
                with a program approved under subdivision 6) may issue 
                a permit that grants an extension permitting an 
                existing source up to 1 additional year to comply with 
                standards under subsection (d) if such an additional 
                period is necessary for the installation of controls. 
                An additional extension of up to 3 years may be added 
                for mining waste operations, if the 4-year compliance 
                time is insufficient to dry and cover mining waste in 
                order to reduce emissions of any pollutant listed under 
                subsection (b).
          (4) Presidential exemption.--The President may exempt any 
        stationary source from compliance with any standard or 
        limitation under this section for a period of not more than 2 
        years if the President determines that the technology to 
        implement the standard is not available and that it is in the 
        national security interests of the United States to do so. An 
        exemption under this paragraph may be extended for 1 or more 
        additional periods, each period not to exceed 2 years. The 
        President shall report to Congress with respect to each 
        exemption (or extension thereof) made under this paragraph.
          (5) Early reduction.--
                  (A) In general.--
                          (i) Permit.--The Administrator (or a State 
                        acting pursuant to a permit program approved 
                        under subdivision 6) shall issue a permit 
                        allowing an existing source, for which the 
                        owner or operator demonstrates that the source 
                        has achieved a reduction of 90 percent or more 
                        in emissions of hazardous air pollutants (95 
                        percent in the case of hazardous air pollutants 
                        that are particulates) from the source, to meet 
                        an alternative emission limitation reflecting 
                        the reduction in lieu of an emission limitation 
                        promulgated under subsection (d) for a period 
                        of 6 years after the compliance date for the 
                        otherwise applicable standard, if reduction is 
                        achieved before the otherwise applicable 
                        standard under subsection (d) is first 
                        proposed.
                          (ii) Effect of paragraph.--Nothing in this 
                        paragraph precludes a State from requiring 
                        reductions in excess of those specified in this 
                        subparagraph as a condition of granting the 
                        extension authorized by clause (i).
                  (B) Reduction determination.--The reduction shall be 
                determined with respect to verifiable and actual 
                emissions in a base year not earlier than calendar year 
                1987, so long as there is no evidence that emissions in 
                the base year are artificially or substantially greater 
                than emissions in other years prior to implementation 
                of emissions reduction measures. The Administrator may 
                allow a source to use a baseline year of 1985 or 1986 
                if the source can demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
                the Administrator that emissions data for the source 
                reflect verifiable data based on information for the 
                source, received by the Administrator prior to November 
                15, 1990, pursuant to an information request issued 
                under section 211114 of this title.
                  (C) Enforceable emission limitation.--For each source 
                granted an alternative emission limitation under this 
                paragraph there shall be established by a permit issued 
                pursuant to subdivision 6 an enforceable emission 
                limitation for hazardous air pollutants reflecting the 
                reduction that qualifies the source for an alternative 
                emission limitation under this paragraph. An 
                alternative emission limitation under this paragraph 
                shall not be available with respect to standards or 
                requirements promulgated pursuant to subsection (f), 
                and the Administrator shall, for the purpose of 
                determining whether a standard under subsection (f) is 
                necessary, review emissions from sources granted an 
                alternative emission limitation under this paragraph at 
                the same time that other sources in the category or 
                subcategory are reviewed.
                  (D) Limitation.--With respect to pollutants for which 
                high risks of adverse public health effects may be 
                associated with exposure to small quantities, including 
                chlorinated dioxins and furans, the Administrator shall 
                by regulation limit the use of offsetting reductions in 
                emissions of other hazardous air pollutants from the 
                source as counting toward the 90 percent reduction in 
                such high-risk pollutants qualifying for an alternative 
                emission limitation under this paragraph.
          (6) Other reductions.--Notwithstanding the requirements of 
        this section, no existing source that has installed--
                  (A) best available control technology (as defined in 
                section 213102 of this title); or
                  (B) technology required to meet a lowest achievable 
                emission rate (as defined in section 215101 of this 
                title);
        prior to the promulgation of a standard under this section 
        applicable to the source and the same pollutant (or stream of 
        pollutants) controlled pursuant to an action described in 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be required to comply with the 
        standard under this section until the date that is 5 years 
        after the date on which the installation or reduction has been 
        achieved, as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator 
        may issue such regulations and guidance as are necessary to 
        implement this paragraph.
          (7) Extension for new sources.--A source for which 
        construction or reconstruction is commenced after the date an 
        emission standard applicable to the source is proposed pursuant 
        to subsection (d) but before the date on which an emission 
        standard applicable to the source is proposed pursuant to 
        subsection (f) shall not be required to comply with the 
        emission standard under subsection (f) until the date that is 
        10 years after the date on which construction or reconstruction 
        is commenced.
          (8) Coke ovens.--
                  (A) Date for achievement of emission limitations.--
                Any coke oven battery that complies with the emission 
                limitations established under subsection (d)(8)(C) and 
                subparagraph (B) shall not be required to achieve 
                emission limitations promulgated under subsection (f) 
                until January 1, 2020.
                  (B) Interim emission limitations.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        promulgate emission limitations for coke oven 
                        emissions from coke oven batteries. The 
                        emission limitations shall reflect the lowest 
                        achievable emission rate (as defined in section 
                        215101 of this title) for a coke oven battery 
                        that is rebuilt or a replacement at a coke oven 
                        plant for an existing battery.
                          (ii) Stringency.--The emission limitations 
                        under clause (i) shall be no less stringent 
                        than--
                                  (I) 3 percent leaking doors (5 
                                percent leaking doors for 6-meter 
                                batteries);
                                  (II) 1 percent leaking lids;
                                  (III) 4 percent leaking offtakes; and
                                  (IV) 16 seconds visible emissions per 
                                charge;
                        with an exclusion for emissions during the 
                        period after the closing of self-sealing oven 
                        doors (or the total mass emissions equivalent).
                          (iii) Measurement methodology; terms.--The 
                        rulemaking in which the emission limitations 
                        are promulgated shall establish an appropriate 
                        measurement methodology for determining 
                        compliance with the emission limitations, and 
                        shall establish such emission limitations in 
                        terms of an equivalent level of mass emissions 
                        reduction from a coke oven battery, unless the 
                        Administrator finds that such a mass emission 
                        standard would not be practicable or 
                        enforceable. The measurement methodology, to 
                        the extent it measures leaking doors, shall 
                        take into consideration alternative test 
                        methods that reflect the best technology and 
                        practices actually applied in the affected 
                        industries, and shall ensure that the final 
                        test methods are consistent with the 
                        performance of such best technology and 
                        practices.
                          (iv) Review and revision.--The Administrator 
                        shall review the emission limitations 
                        promulgated under clause (i) and revise, as 
                        necessary, the emission limitations to reflect 
                        the lowest achievable emission rate (as defined 
                        in section 215101 of this title) at the time 
                        for a coke oven battery that is rebuilt or a 
                        replacement at a coke oven plant for an 
                        existing battery. Such emission limitations 
                        shall be no less stringent than the emission 
                        limitation promulgated under clause (i). 
                        Notwithstanding paragraph (2), the compliance 
                        date for such emission limitations for existing 
                        coke oven batteries shall be January 1, 2010.
                  (C) Election to comply.--Prior to January 1, 1998, 
                the owner or operator of any coke oven battery may 
                elect to comply with emission limitations promulgated 
                under subsection (f) by the date on which those 
                emission limitations would otherwise apply to the coke 
                oven battery, in lieu of the emission limitations and 
                the compliance dates provided under subparagraph (B). 
                Any such owner or operator shall be legally bound to 
                comply with the emission limitations promulgated under 
                subsection (f) with respect to that coke oven battery. 
                If no such emission limitations have been promulgated 
                for the coke oven battery, the Administrator shall 
                promulgate such emission limitations in accordance with 
                subsection (f) for that coke oven battery.
                  (D) Effect of reconstruction.--
                          (i) Definition of reconstruction.--In this 
                        subparagraph, the term ``reconstruction'' 
                        includes the replacement of existing coke oven 
                        battery capacity with new coke oven batteries 
                        of comparable or lower capacity and lower 
                        potential emissions.
                          (ii) Effect.--Notwithstanding this section, 
                        reconstruction of any source of coke oven 
                        emissions qualifying for an extension under 
                        this paragraph shall not subject the source to 
                        emission limitations under subsection (f) that 
                        are more stringent than those established under 
                        subparagraph (B) until January 1, 2020.
  (j) Area Source Program.--
          (1) Findings and purpose.--Congress finds that emissions of 
        hazardous air pollutants from area sources may individually, or 
        in the aggregate, present significant risks to public health in 
        urban areas. Considering the large number of persons exposed 
        and the risks of carcinogenic and other adverse health effects 
        from hazardous air pollutants, ambient concentrations 
        characteristic of large urban areas should be reduced to levels 
        substantially below those currently experienced. It is the 
        purpose of this subsection to achieve a substantial reduction 
        in emissions of hazardous air pollutants from area sources and 
        an equivalent reduction in the public health risks associated 
        with area sources, including a reduction of not less than 75 
        percent in the incidence of cancer attributable to emissions 
        from area sources.
          (2) Research program.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall, after 
                consultation with State and local air pollution control 
                officials, conduct a program of research with respect 
                to sources of hazardous air pollutants in urban areas 
                that includes within the program--
                          (i) ambient monitoring for a broad range of 
                        hazardous air pollutants (including volatile 
                        organic compounds, metals, pesticides, and 
                        products of incomplete combustion) in a 
                        representative number of urban locations;
                          (ii) analysis to characterize the sources of 
                        such pollution with a focus on area sources and 
                        the contribution that area sources make to 
                        public health risks from hazardous air 
                        pollutants; and
                          (iii) consideration of atmospheric 
                        transformation and other factors that can 
                        elevate public health risks from such 
                        pollutants.
                  (B) Health effects to be considered.--The health 
                effects considered under the program include 
                carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
                neurotoxicity, reproductive dysfunction, and other 
                acute and chronic effects, including the role of such 
                pollutants as precursors of ozone or acid aerosol 
                formation.
          (3) National strategy.--
                  (A) In general.--Considering information collected 
                pursuant to the monitoring program authorized by 
                paragraph (2), the Administrator shall, after notice 
                and opportunity for public comment, submit to Congress 
                a comprehensive strategy to control emissions of 
                hazardous air pollutants from area sources in urban 
                areas.
                  (B) Contents.--
                          (i) In general.--The strategy shall--
                                  (I) identify not less than 30 
                                hazardous air pollutants that, as the 
                                result of emissions from area sources, 
                                present the greatest threat to public 
                                health in the largest number of urban 
                                areas and that are or will be listed 
                                pursuant to subsection (b); and
                                  (II) identify the source categories 
                                or subcategories emitting such 
                                pollutants that are or will be listed 
                                pursuant to subsection (c).
                          (ii) Percentage of sources subject to 
                        standards.--When identifying categories and 
                        subcategories of sources under this 
                        subparagraph, the Administrator shall ensure 
                        that sources accounting for 90 percent or more 
                        of the aggregate emissions of each of the 30 
                        identified hazardous air pollutants are subject 
                        to standards pursuant to subsection (d).
                  (C) Requirements.--The strategy shall--
                          (i) include a schedule of specific actions to 
                        substantially reduce the public health risks 
                        posed by the release of hazardous air 
                        pollutants from area sources that will be 
                        implemented by the Administrator under the 
                        authority of this division or other laws 
                        (including the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 
                        U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), the Federal Insecticide, 
                        Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et 
                        seq.), and the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 
                        U.S.C. 6901 et seq.)) or by the States; and
                          (ii) achieve a reduction in the incidence of 
                        cancer attributable to exposure to hazardous 
                        air pollutants emitted by stationary sources of 
                        not less than 75 percent, considering control 
                        of emissions of hazardous air pollutants from 
                        all stationary sources and resulting from 
                        measures implemented by the Administrator or by 
                        the States under this division or other laws.
                  (D) Research needs.--The strategy may identify 
                research needs in monitoring, analytical methodology, 
                modeling, or pollution control techniques and make 
                recommendations for changes in law that would further 
                the goals and objectives of this subsection.
                  (E) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection 
                shall be interpreted to preclude or delay 
                implementation of actions with respect to area sources 
                of hazardous air pollutants under consideration 
                pursuant to this or any other law and that may be 
                promulgated before the strategy is prepared.
                  (F) Implementation.--The Administrator shall 
                implement the strategy as expeditiously as practicable, 
                ensuring that all sources are in compliance with all 
                requirements.
                  (G) Ambient monitoring and emissions modeling.--As 
                part of the strategy, the Administrator shall provide 
                for ambient monitoring and emissions modeling in urban 
                areas as appropriate to demonstrate that the goals and 
                objectives of the strategy are being met.
          (4) Areawide activities.--The Administrator shall encourage 
        and support areawide strategies developed by State or local air 
        pollution control agencies that are intended to reduce risks 
        from emissions by area sources within a particular urban area. 
        From the funds available for grants under this section, the 
        Administrator shall set aside not less than 10 percent to 
        support areawide strategies addressing hazardous air pollutants 
        emitted by area sources and shall award such funds on a 
        demonstration basis to States with innovative and effective 
        strategies. At the request of State or local air pollution 
        control officials, the Administrator shall prepare guidelines 
        for control technologies or management practices that may be 
        applicable to various categories or subcategories of area 
        sources.
  (k) State Programs.--
          (1) In general.--Each State may develop and submit to the 
        Administrator for approval a program for the implementation and 
        enforcement (including a review of enforcement delegations 
        previously granted) of emission standards and other 
        requirements for air pollutants subject to this section or 
        requirements for the prevention and mitigation of accidental 
        releases pursuant to subsection (q). A program submitted by a 
        State under this subsection may provide for partial or complete 
        delegation of the Administrator's authorities and 
        responsibilities to implement and enforce emission standards 
        and prevention requirements but shall not include authority to 
        set standards less stringent than those promulgated by the 
        Administrator under this division.
          (2) Guidance.--The Administrator shall publish guidance that 
        would be useful to States in developing programs for submittal 
        under this subsection. The guidance shall provide for the 
        registration of all facilities producing, processing, handling, 
        or storing any substance listed pursuant to subsection (q) in 
        amounts greater than the threshold quantity. The Administrator 
        shall include as an element in such guidance an optional 
        program begun in 1986 for the review of high-risk point sources 
        of air pollutants including hazardous air pollutants listed 
        pursuant to subsection (b).
          (3) Technical assistance.--The Administrator shall establish 
        and maintain an air toxics clearinghouse and center to provide 
        technical information and assistance to State and local 
        agencies and, on a cost recovery basis, to others on control 
        technology, health and ecological risk assessment, risk 
        analysis, ambient monitoring and modeling, and emissions 
        measurement and monitoring. The Administrator shall use the 
        authority of section 211103 of this title to examine methods 
        for preventing, measuring, and controlling emissions and 
        evaluating associated health and ecological risks. Where 
        appropriate, such activity shall be conducted with not-for-
        profit organizations. The Administrator may conduct research on 
        methods for preventing, measuring, and controlling emissions 
        and evaluating associated health and environment risks. All 
        information collected under this paragraph shall be available 
        to the public.
          (4) Grants.--On application of a State, the Administrator may 
        make grants, subject to such terms and conditions as the 
        Administrator considers appropriate, to the State for the 
        purpose of assisting the State in developing and implementing a 
        program for submittal and approval under this subsection. 
        Programs assisted under this paragraph may include program 
        elements addressing air pollutants or extremely hazardous 
        substances other than those specifically subject to this 
        section. Grants under this paragraph may include support for 
        high-risk point source review as provided in paragraph (2) and 
        support for the development and implementation of areawide area 
        source programs pursuant to subsection (j).
          (5) Approval or disapproval.--
                  (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after 
                receiving a program submitted by a State, and after 
                notice and opportunity for public comment, the 
                Administrator shall approve or disapprove the program.
                  (B) Disapproval.--The Administrator shall disapprove 
                any program submitted by a State, if the Administrator 
                determines that--
                          (i) the authorities contained in the program 
                        are not adequate to ensure compliance by all 
                        sources within the State with each applicable 
                        standard, regulation, or requirement 
                        established by the Administrator under this 
                        section;
                          (ii) adequate authority does not exist, or 
                        adequate resources are not available, to 
                        implement the program;
                          (iii) the schedule for implementing the 
                        program and ensuring compliance by affected 
                        sources is not sufficiently expeditious; or
                          (iv) the program is otherwise not in 
                        compliance with the guidance issued by the 
                        Administrator under paragraph (2) or is not 
                        likely to satisfy, in whole or in part, the 
                        objectives of this division.
                  (C) Notification of disapproval.--If the 
                Administrator disapproves a State program, the 
                Administrator shall notify the State of any revisions 
                or modifications necessary to obtain approval. The 
                State may revise and resubmit the proposed program for 
                review and approval pursuant to this subsection.
          (6) Withdrawal.--Whenever the Administrator determines, after 
        public hearing, that a State is not administering and enforcing 
        a program approved pursuant to this subsection in accordance 
        with the guidance published pursuant to paragraph (2) or the 
        requirements of paragraph (5), the Administrator shall so 
        notify the State and, if action that will ensure prompt 
        compliance is not taken within 90 days, the Administrator shall 
        withdraw approval of the program. The Administrator shall not 
        withdraw approval of any program unless, prior to withdrawal, 
        the State is notified and the reasons for withdrawal are stated 
        in writing and made public.
          (7) Authority to enforce.--Nothing in this subsection 
        precludes the Administrator from enforcing any applicable 
        emission standard or requirement under this section.
          (8) Local program.--The Administrator may, after notice and 
        opportunity for public comment, approve a program developed and 
        submitted by a local air pollution control agency (after 
        consultation with the State) pursuant to this subsection, and 
        any such agency implementing an approved program may take any 
        action authorized to be taken by a State under this section.
          (9) Permit authority.--Nothing in this subsection affects the 
        authorities and obligations of the Administrator or the State 
        under subdivision 6.
  (l) Atmospheric Deposition to Great Lakes and Coastal Water.--
          (1) Definition of coastal water.--In this subsection, the 
        term ``coastal water'' means--
                  (A) an estuary selected pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
                or listed pursuant to subparagraph (B) of section 
                320(a)(2) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
                (33 U.S.C. 1330(a)(2)); or
                  (B) an estuarine research reserve designated pursuant 
                to section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 
                1972 (16 U.S.C. 1461).
          (2) Deposition assessment.--The Administrator, in cooperation 
        with the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, 
        shall conduct a program to identify and assess the extent of 
        atmospheric deposition of hazardous air pollutants (and in the 
        discretion of the Administrator, other air pollutants) to the 
        Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain, and coastal 
        water. As part of the program, the Administrator shall--
                  (A) monitor the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Lake 
                Champlain, and coastal water, including monitoring of 
                the Great Lakes through the monitoring network 
                established pursuant to paragraph (3) and designing and 
                deploying an atmospheric monitoring network for coastal 
                waters pursuant to paragraph (5);
                  (B) investigate the sources and deposition rates of 
                atmospheric deposition of air pollutants (and their 
                atmospheric transformation precursors);
                  (C) conduct research to develop and improve 
                monitoring methods and to determine the relative 
                contribution of atmospheric pollutants to total 
                pollution loadings to the Great Lakes, the Chesapeake 
                Bay, Lake Champlain, and coastal water;
                  (D) evaluate any adverse effects on public health or 
                the environment caused by such deposition (including 
                effects resulting from indirect exposure pathways) and 
                assess the contribution of the deposition to violations 
                of water quality standards established pursuant to the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et 
                seq.) and drinking water standards established pursuant 
                to the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et 
                seq.); and
                  (E) sample for such pollutants in biota of the Great 
                Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, Lake Champlain, and coastal 
                water and characterize the sources of the pollutants.
          (3) Great lakes monitoring network.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall oversee, in 
                accordance with annex 15 of the Great Lakes Water 
                Quality Agreement of 1978 (T.I.A.S. 11551; KAV 255), 
                the establishment and operation of a Great Lakes 
                atmospheric deposition network to monitor atmospheric 
                deposition of hazardous air pollutants (and in the 
                Administrator's discretion, other air pollutants) to 
                the Great Lakes.
                  (B) Monitoring facilities.--As part of the network 
                provided for in this paragraph, the Administrator shall 
                establish in each of the 5 Great Lakes at least 1 
                facility capable of monitoring the atmospheric 
                deposition of hazardous air pollutants in both dry and 
                wet conditions.
                  (C) Use of data.--The Administrator shall use the 
                data provided by the network to--

                Lake Champlain atmospheric deposition stations to 
                monitor deposition of hazardous air pollutants (and in 
                the Administrator's discretion, other air pollutants) 
                within the Chesapeake Bay and Lake Champlain 
                watersheds.
                  (B) Activities.--The Administrator shall--
                          (i) determine the role of air deposition in 
                        the pollutant loadings of the Chesapeake Bay 
                        and Lake Champlain;
                          (ii) investigate the sources of air 
                        pollutants deposited in the watersheds;
                          (iii) evaluate the health and environmental 
                        effects of such pollutant loadings; and
                          (iv) sample such pollutants in biota within 
                        the watersheds, as necessary to characterize 
                        such effects.
          (5) Monitoring for coastal water.--The Administrator shall 
        design and deploy atmospheric deposition monitoring networks 
        for coastal water and watersheds of coastal water and shall 
        make any information collected through such networks available 
        to the public. As part of that effort, the Administrator shall 
        conduct research to develop and improve deposition monitoring 
        methods, and to determine the relative contribution of 
        atmospheric pollutants to pollutant loadings.
  (m) Miscellaneous Provisions.--
          (1) Electric utility steam generating units.--The 
        Administrator shall perform a study of the hazards to public 
        health reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions 
        by electric utility steam generating units of pollutants listed 
        under subsection (b) after imposition of the requirements of 
        this division. The Administrator shall report the results of 
        the study to Congress. The Administrator shall develop and 
        describe in the report alternative control strategies for 
        emissions that may warrant regulation under this section. The 
        Administrator shall regulate electric utility steam generating 
        units under this section if the Administrator finds that 
        regulation is appropriate and necessary after considering the 
        results of the study.
          (2) Publicly owned treatment works.--The Administrator may 
        conduct, in cooperation with the owners and operators of 
        publicly owned treatment works, studies to characterize 
        emissions of hazardous air pollutants emitted by such 
        facilities, to identify industrial, commercial, and residential 
        discharges that contribute to such emissions, and to 
        demonstrate control measures for such emissions. When 
        promulgating any standard under this section applicable to 
        publicly owned treatment works, the Administrator may provide 
        for control measures that include pretreatment of discharges 
        causing emissions of hazardous air pollutants and process or 
        product substitutions or limitations that may be effective in 
        reducing such emissions. The Administrator may prescribe 
        uniform sampling, modeling, and risk assessment methods for use 
        in implementing this subsection.
          (3) Oil and gas wells; pipeline facilities.--
                  (A) No aggregation of units.--Notwithstanding

                        or production well (with its associated 
                        equipment) and emissions from any pipeline 
                        compressor or pump station shall not be 
                        aggregated with emissions from other similar 
                        units, whether or not the units are in a 
                        contiguous area or under common control, to 
                        determine whether the units or stations are 
                        major sources; and
                          (ii) in the case of any oil or gas 
                        exploration or production well (with its 
                        associated equipment), the emissions from those 
                        units shall not be aggregated for any purpose 
                        under this section.
                  (B) No listing as area source category.--
                          (i) In general.--Except as provided in clause 
                        (ii), the Administrator shall not list oil and 
                        gas production wells (with their associated 
                        equipment) as an area source category under 
                        subsection (c).
                          (ii) Exception.--The Administrator may 
                        establish an area source category for oil and 
                        gas production wells located in any 
                        metropolitan statistical area or consolidated 
                        metropolitan statistical area with a population 
                        in excess of 1,000,000 if the Administrator 
                        determines that emissions of hazardous air 
                        pollutants from the wells present more than a 
                        negligible risk of adverse effects on public 
                        health.
          (4) RCRA facilities.--In the case of any category or 
        subcategory of sources the air emissions of which are regulated 
        under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C.

                the carcinogenic potency to humans of hazardous air 
                pollutants; and
                  (B) the techniques used for estimating exposure to 
                hazardous air pollutants (for hypothetical and actual 
                maximally exposed individuals and other exposed 
                individuals).
          (3) Other health effects of concern.--To the extent 
        practicable, the Academy shall evaluate and report on the 
        methodology for assessing the risk of adverse human health 
        effects other than cancer for which safe thresholds of exposure 
        may not exist, including inheritable genetic mutations, birth 
        defects, and reproductive dysfunctions.
          (4) Report.--A report on the results of the review shall be 
        submitted to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of 
        the Senate, the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House 
        of Representatives, and the Administrator.
          (5) Assistance.--The Administrator shall assist the Academy 
        in gathering any information that the Academy considers 
        necessary to carry out this subsection. The Administrator may 
        use any authority under this division to obtain information

        margin of safety to protect public health, the requirements of 
        this section shall fully apply to medical research or treatment 
        facilities. If the Administrator determines that the regulatory 
        program does provide an ample margin of safety to protect the 
        public health, the Administrator is not required to promulgate 
        a standard under this section for medical research or treatment 
        facilities, as provided in subsection (d)(9).

                        taking such steps as are necessary to prevent 
                        accidental releases; and
                          (iii) minimize the consequences of accidental 
                        releases that do occur.
                  (C) No citizen suits.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, section 203104 of this title shall not be 
                available to any person or otherwise be construed to be 
                applicable to this paragraph.
                  (D) Effect of paragraph.--Nothing in this section 
                shall be interpreted, construed, or applied to create, 
                or held to imply the creation of, any liability or 
                basis for suit for compensation for bodily injury or 
                any other injury or property damages to any person that 
                may result from an accidental release.
          (3) List of substances.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                an initial list of 100 substances that, in the case of 
                an accidental release, are known to cause or may 
                reasonably be anticipated to cause death or injury to 
                humans or serious adverse effects on human health or 
                the environment.
                  (B) Use of list under the emergency planning and 
                community right-to-know act of 1986.--For purposes of

                isocyanate, phosgene, sulfur trioxide, toluene 
                diisocyanate, and vinyl chloride.
                  (D) Number of substances.--The initial list shall 
                include at least 100 substances that pose the greatest 
                risk of causing death or injury to humans or serious 
                adverse effects on human health or the environment from 
                accidental releases.
                  (E) Explanation.--Regulations establishing the list 
                shall include an explanation of the basis for 
                establishing the list.
                  (F) Revision; review.--The list--
                          (i) may be revised from time to time by the 
                        Administrator on the Administrator's own motion 
                        or by petition; and
                          (ii) shall be reviewed at least every 5 
                        years.
                  (G) Limitations.--No air pollutant for which a 
                primary NAAQS has been established shall be included on 
                the list. No substance, practice, process, or activity 
                regulated under subdivision 7 shall be subject to 
                regulations under this subsection.
                  (H) Addition and deletion.--The Administrator shall 
                establish procedures for the addition and deletion of 
                substances from the list established under this 
                paragraph consistent with those applicable to the list 
                under subsection (b).
          (4) Factors to be considered.--In listing substances under 
        paragraph (3), the Administrator--
                  (A) shall consider--
                          (i) the severity of any acute adverse health 
                        effects associated with accidental releases of 
                        the substance;
                          (ii) the likelihood of accidental releases of 
                        the substance; and
                          (iii) the potential magnitude of human 
                        exposure to accidental releases of the 
                        substance; and
                  (B) shall not list a flammable substance when used as 
                a fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility 
                under this subsection solely because of the explosive 
                or flammable properties of the substance, unless a fire 
                or explosion caused by the substance will result in 
                acute adverse health effects from human exposure to the 
                substance, including the unburned fuel or its 
                combustion byproducts, other than those caused by the 
                heat of the fire or impact of the explosion.
          (5) Threshold quantity.--At the time at which any substance 
        is listed pursuant to paragraph (3), the Administrator shall 
        establish by regulation a threshold quantity for the substance, 
        taking into account the toxicity, reactivity, volatility, 
        dispersibility, combustibility, or flammability of the 
        substance and the amount of the substance that, as a result of 
        an accidental release, is known to cause or may reasonably be 
        anticipated to cause death or injury to humans or serious 
        adverse effects on human health for which the substance was 
        listed. The Administrator may establish a greater threshold 
        quantity for, or to exempt entirely, any substance that is a 
        nutrient used in agriculture when held by a farmer.
          (6) Chemical safety board.--
                  (A) Establishment.--There is established an 
                independent safety board to be known as the Chemical 
                Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (referred to in 
                this paragraph as the ``Board'').
                  (B) Membership.--The Board shall consist of 5 
                members, including a Chairperson, who shall be 
                appointed by the President, by and with the advice and 
                consent of the Senate. Members of the Board shall be 
                appointed on the basis of technical qualification, 
                professional standing, and demonstrated knowledge in 
                the fields of accident reconstruction, safety 
                engineering, human factors, toxicology, or air 
                pollution regulation. The terms of office of members of 
                the Board shall be 5 years. Any member of the Board, 
                including the Chairperson, may be removed for 
                inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in 
                office. The Chairperson shall be the Chief Executive 
                Officer of the Board and shall exercise the executive 
                and administrative functions of the Board.
                  (C) Duties.--
                          (i) In general.--The Board shall--
                                  (I) investigate (or cause to be 
                                investigated), determine, and report to 
                                the public in writing the facts, 
                                conditions, circumstances and cause or 
                                probable cause of any accidental 
                                release resulting in a fatality, 
                                serious injury, or substantial property 
                                damages;
                                  (II) issue periodic reports to 
                                Federal, State, and local agencies 
                                concerned with the safety of chemical 
                                production, processing, handling, and 
                                storage, and other interested persons 
                                (including EPA and the Occupational 
                                Safety and Health Administration) 
                                that--
                                          (aa) recommend measures to 
                                        reduce the likelihood or the 
                                        consequences of accidental 
                                        releases and propose corrective 
                                        steps to make chemical 
                                        production, processing, 
                                        handling, and storage as safe 
                                        and free from risk of injury as 
                                        is possible; and
                                          (bb) may include proposed 
                                        regulations or orders that 
                                        should be issued by the 
                                        Administrator under this 
                                        section or by the Secretary of 
                                        Labor under the Occupational 
                                        Safety and Health Act of 1970 
                                        (29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) to 
                                        prevent or minimize the 
                                        consequences of any release of 
                                        substances that may cause death 
                                        or injury to humans or other 
                                        serious adverse effects on 
                                        human health or substantial 
                                        property damage as the result 
                                        of an accidental release; and
                                  (III) establish by regulation 
                                requirements binding on persons for 
                                reporting accidental releases into the 
                                ambient air subject to the Board's 
                                investigatory jurisdiction.
                          (ii) Reporting.--Reporting releases to the 
                        National Response Center, in lieu of the Board 
                        directly, shall satisfy the regulations under 
                        clause (i)(III). The National Response Center 
                        shall promptly notify the Board of any releases 
                        that are within the Board's jurisdiction.
                  (D) Expertise and experience of other agencies.--The 
                Board may utilize the expertise and experience of other 
                agencies.
                  (E) Coordination with other agencies.--The Board 
                shall coordinate its activities with investigations and 
                studies conducted by other agencies of the United 
                States having a responsibility to protect public health 
                and safety. The Board shall enter into a memorandum of 
                understanding with the National Transportation Safety 
                Board to ensure coordination of functions and to limit 
                duplication of activities, which shall designate the 
                National Transportation Safety Board as the lead agency 
                for the investigation of releases that are 
                transportation-related. The Board shall not be 
                authorized to investigate marine oil spills, which the 
                National Transportation Safety Board is authorized to 
                investigate. The Board shall enter into a memorandum of 
                understanding with the Occupational Safety and Health 
                Administration to limit duplication of activities. In 
                no event shall the Board forgo an investigation where 
                an accidental release causes a fatality or serious 
                injury among the general public, or had the potential 
                to cause substantial property damage or a number of 
                deaths or injuries among the general public.
                  (F) Research; studies.--The Board may conduct 
                research and studies with respect to the potential for 
                accidental releases, whether or not an accidental 
                release has occurred, where there is evidence that 
                indicates the presence of a potential hazard or 
                hazards. To the extent practicable, the Board shall 
                conduct such studies in cooperation with other Federal 
                agencies having emergency response authorities, State 
                and local governmental agencies, and associations and 
                organizations from the industrial, commercial, and 
                nonprofit sectors.
                  (G) No admission into evidence.--No part of the 
                conclusions, findings, or recommendations of the Board 
                relating to any accidental release or the investigation 
                thereof shall be admitted as evidence or used in any 
                action or suit for damages arising out of any matter 
                mentioned in the report.
                  (H) Recommendations to the administrator on the use 
                of hazard assessments.--
                          (i) Recommendations.--The Board shall publish 
                        a report accompanied by recommendations to the 
                        Administrator on the use of hazard assessments 
                        in preventing the occurrence and minimizing the 
                        consequences of accidental releases of 
                        extremely hazardous substances. The 
                        recommendations shall include a list of 
                        extremely hazardous substances that are not 
                        regulated substances (including threshold 
                        quantities for such substances) and categories 
                        of stationary sources for which hazard 
                        assessments would be an appropriate measure to 
                        aid in the prevention of accidental releases 
                        and to minimize the consequences of releases 
                        that do occur and a description of the 
                        information and analysis that would be 
                        appropriate to include in any hazard 
                        assessment. The Board shall make 
                        recommendations with respect to the role of 
                        risk management plans as required by paragraph 
                        (7)(B)(ii) in preventing accidental releases. 
                        The Board may from time to time review and 
                        revise its recommendations under this 
                        subparagraph.
                          (ii) Response by the administrator.--
                                  (I) In general.--Whenever the Board 
                                submits a recommendation with respect 
                                to accidental releases to the 
                                Administrator, the Administrator shall 
                                respond to the recommendation formally 
                                and in writing not later than 180 days 
                                after receipt of the recommendation. 
                                The response to the Board's 
                                recommendation by the Administrator 
                                shall indicate whether the 
                                Administrator will--
                                          (aa) initiate a rulemaking or 
                                        issue such orders as are 
                                        necessary to implement the 
                                        recommendation in full or in 
                                        part, pursuant to any timetable

                        information that users may read, but that 
                        provides no means by which an electronic or 
                        mechanical copy of the information may be made.
                          (viii) Voluntary industry accident prevention 
                        standards.--EPA, the Department of Justice, and 
                        other appropriate agencies may provide 
                        technical assistance to owners and operators of 
                        stationary sources and participate in the 
                        development of voluntary industry standards 
                        that will help achieve the objectives set forth 
                        in paragraph (2).
                          (ix) Effect on state or local law.--
                                  (I) In general.--Subject to subclause 
                                (II), this subparagraph (including the 
                                regulations promulgated under this 
                                subparagraph) shall supersede any 
                                provision of State or local law that is 
                                inconsistent with this subparagraph 
                                (including the regulations).
                                  (II) Availability of information 
                                under state law.--Nothing in this 
                                subparagraph precludes a State from 
                                making available data on the off-site 
                                consequences of chemical releases 
                                collected in accordance with State law.
                          (x) Report on result of regulations.--
                                  (I) In general.--The Attorney 
                                General, in consultation with 
                                appropriate Federal, State, and local 
                                government agencies, affected industry, 
                                and the public, shall submit to 
                                Congress a report that describes the 
                                extent to which regulations promulgated 
                                under this paragraph have resulted in 
                                actions, including the design and 
                                maintenance of safe facilities, that 
                                are effective in detecting, preventing, 
                                and minimizing the consequences of 
                                releases of regulated substances that 
                                may be caused by criminal activity. As 
                                part of the report, the Attorney 
                                General, using available data to the 
                                extent possible, and a sampling of 
                                covered stationary sources selected at 
                                the discretion of the Attorney General, 
                                and in consultation with appropriate 
                                Federal, State, and local government 
                                agencies, affected industry, and the 
                                public, shall review the vulnerability 
                                of covered stationary sources to 
                                criminal and terrorist activity, 
                                current industry practices regarding 
                                site security, and security of 
                                transportation of regulated substances. 
                                The Attorney General shall submit the 
                                report, containing the results of the 
                                review, together with recommendations, 
                                if any, for reducing vulnerability of 
                                covered stationary sources to criminal 
                                and terrorist activity, to the 
                                Committee on Energy and Commerce of the 
                                House of Representatives and the 
                                Committee on Environment and Public 
                                Works of the Senate and other relevant 
                                committees of Congress.
                                  (II) Nonavailability of information 
                                developed or received for report.--
                                Information developed by the Attorney 
                                General or requested by the Attorney 
                                General and received from a covered 
                                stationary source for the purpose of 
                                conducting the review under subclause 
                                (I) shall be exempt from disclosure 
                                under section 552 of title 5 if 
                                disclosure of the information would 
                                pose a threat to national security.
                          (xi) Scope.--This subparagraph--
                                  (I) applies only to covered persons; 
                                and
                                  (II) does not restrict the 
                                dissemination of off-site consequence 
                                analysis information by any covered 
                                person in any manner or form except in 
                                the form of a risk management plan or 
                                an electronic data base created by the 
                                Administrator from off-site consequence 
                                analysis information.
                          (xii) Authorization of appropriations.--There 
                        are authorized to be appropriated to the 
                        Administrator and the Attorney General such 
                        sums as are necessary to carry out this 
                        subparagraph (including the regulations 
                        promulgated under clause (ii)), to remain 
                        available until expended.
                  (E) Distinctions.--Regulations promulgated under this 
                paragraph may make distinctions between various types, 
                classes, and kinds of facilities, devices, and systems, 
                taking into consideration factors that include the 
                size, location, process, process controls, quantity of 
                substances handled, potency of substances, and response 
                capabilities present at any stationary source.
          (8) Research on hazard assessments.--The Administrator may 
        collect and publish information on accident scenarios and 
        consequences covering a range of possible events for substances 
        listed under paragraph (3). The Administrator shall establish a 
        program of long-term research to develop and disseminate 
        information on methods and techniques for hazard assessment 
        that may be useful in improving and validating the procedures 
        employed in the preparation of hazard assessments under this 
        subsection.
          (9) Order authority.--
                  (A) In general.--In addition to any other action 
                taken, when the Administrator determines that there may 
                be an imminent and substantial endangerment to the 
                human health or welfare or the environment because of 
                an actual or threatened accidental release of a 
                regulated substance, the Administrator may secure such 
                relief as may be necessary to abate the danger or 
                threat, and the district court of the United States for 
                the district in which the threat occurs shall have 
                jurisdiction to grant such relief as the public 
                interest and the equities of the case may require. The 
                Administrator may also, after notice to the State in 
                which the stationary source is located, take other 
                action under this paragraph including issuing such 
                orders as may be necessary to protect human health. The 
                Administrator shall take action under section 203103 of 
                this title rather than this paragraph whenever the 
                authority of that section is adequate to protect human 
                health and the environment.
                  (B) Enforcement.--An order issued pursuant to this 
                paragraph may be enforced in an action brought in the 
                appropriate United States district court as if the 
                order were issued under section 203103 of this title.
                  (C) Guidance.--The Administrator shall publish 
                guidance for using the order authorities established by 
                this paragraph. The guidance shall provide for the 
                coordinated use of the authorities of this paragraph 
                with other emergency powers authorized by section 106 
                of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
                Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 
                9606), sections 308, 309, 311(c), and 504(a) of the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1318, 
                1319, 1321(c), 1364(a)), sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 
                7003 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6927, 
                6928, 6934, 6973), sections 1431 and 1445 of the Safe 
                Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300i, 300j-4), sections 5 
                and 7 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 
                2604, 2606), and sections 203103, 211113, and 211114 of 
                this title.
          (10) State authority.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        preclude, deny, or limit any right of a State or political 
        subdivision thereof to adopt or enforce any regulation, 
        requirement, limitation, or standard (including any procedural 
        requirement) that is more stringent than a regulation, 
        requirement, limitation, or standard in effect under this 
        subsection or that applies to a substance not subject to this 
        subsection.
          (11) Consistency with asme, asni, and astm standards and 
        recommendations.--Any regulations promulgated pursuant to this 
        subsection shall, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent 
        with this subsection, be consistent with the recommendations 
        and standards established by the American Society of Mechanical 
        Engineers, the American National Standards Institute, or ASTM 
        International.
          (12) Concerns of small business.--The Administrator shall 
        take into consideration the concerns of small business in 
        promulgating regulations under this subsection.
          (13) Radionuclides.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        interpreted, construed, or applied to impose requirements 
        affecting, or to grant the Administrator, the Chemical Safety 
        and Hazard Investigation Board, or any other agency any 
        authority to regulate (including requirements for hazard 
        assessment), the accidental release of radionuclides arising 
        from the construction and operation of facilities licensed by 
        the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
          (14) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any person to 
        operate any stationary source subject to a regulation or 
        requirement imposed under this subsection in violation of the 
        regulation or requirement. Each regulation or requirement under 
        this subsection shall, for purposes of sections 203102, 203104, 
        211113, 211114, 211116, and 211119 of this title and other 
        enforcement provisions of this division, be treated as a 
        standard in effect under subsection (d).
          (15) Permits.--Notwithstanding subdivision 6 or this section, 
        no stationary source shall be required to apply for, or operate 
        pursuant to, a permit issued under that subdivision solely 
        because the source is subject to regulations or requirements 
        under this subsection.
          (16) Occupational safety and health.--In exercising any 
        authority under this subsection, the Administrator shall not, 
        for purposes of section 4(b)(1) of the Occupational Safety and 
        Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653(b)(1)), be considered to be 
        exercising statutory authority to prescribe or enforce 
        standards or regulations affecting occupational safety and 
        health.
Sec. 211113. Federal enforcement
  (a) Definitions.--In this section:
          (1) Operator.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``operator'' includes any 
                person who is a part of senior management personnel or 
                is a corporate officer.
                  (B) Exclusions.--Except in the case of a knowing and 
                willful violation, the term ``operator'' does not 
                include any person who is a stationary engineer or 
                technician responsible for the operation, maintenance, 
                repair, or monitoring of equipment and facilities and 
                who often has supervisory and training duties but who 
                is not a part of senior management personnel and not a 
                corporate officer.
          (2) Period of federally assumed enforcement.--The term 
        ``period of federally assumed enforcement'' means a period 
        described in subsection (b)(2)(C).
  (b) In General.--
          (1) Order to comply with sip.--Whenever, on the basis of any 
        information available to the Administrator, the Administrator 
        finds that any person has violated or is in violation of any 
        requirement or prohibition of an applicable implementation plan 
        or permit, the Administrator shall notify the person and the 
        State in which the plan applies of the finding. At any time 
        after the expiration of 30 days following the date on which the 
        notice of violation is issued, the Administrator may, without 
        regard to the period of violation (subject to section 2462 of 
        title 28)--
                  (A) issue an order requiring the person to comply 
                with the requirements or prohibitions of the plan or 
                permit;
                  (B) issue an administrative penalty order in 
                accordance with subsection (e); or
                  (C) bring a civil action in accordance with 
                subsection (c).
          (2) State failure to enforce sip or permit program.--
                  (A) Notice to state.--Whenever, on the basis of 
                information available to the Administrator, the 
                Administrator finds that violations of an applicable 
                implementation plan or an approved permit program under 
                subdivision 6 are so widespread that the violations 
                appear to result from a failure of the State in which 
                the plan or permit program applies to enforce the plan 
                or permit program effectively, the Administrator shall 
                so notify the State. In the case of a permit program, 
                the notice shall be made in accordance with subdivision 
                6.
                  (B) Public notice.--If the Administrator finds that 
                the failure extends beyond the 30th day after the 
                notice (90 days in the case of such a permit program), 
                the Administrator shall give public notice of that 
                finding.
                  (C) Period of federally assumed enforcement.--During 
                the period beginning with the public notice under 
                subparagraph (B) and ending when the State satisfies 
                the Administrator that the State will enforce the plan 
                or permit program, the Administrator may enforce any 
                requirement or prohibition of the plan or permit 
                program with respect to any person by--
                          (i) issuing an order requiring the person to 
                        comply with the requirement or prohibition;
                          (ii) issuing an administrative penalty order 
                        in accordance with subsection (e); or
                          (iii) bringing a civil action in accordance 
                        with subsection (c).
          (3) EPA enforcement of other requirements.--Except for a 
        requirement or prohibition enforceable under paragraph (1) or 
        (2), when, on the basis of any information available to the 
        Administrator, the Administrator finds that any person has 
        violated, or is in violation of, any other requirement or 
        prohibition of this subdivision, section 203103 of this title, 
        subdivision 5, 6, or 7 (including a requirement or prohibition 
        of any regulation, plan, order, waiver, or permit promulgated,

                basis of any available information, the Administrator 
                finds that the person--
                          (i) has violated or is violating any 
                        requirement or prohibition of an applicable 
                        implementation plan; or
                          (ii) has violated or is violating any other

                        which a finding under subsection (b)(5) has 
                        been made.
                  (B) Time for issuance.--An administrative order under 
                subparagraph (A)(i) shall be issued--
                          (i) during any period of federally assumed 
                        enforcement; or
                          (ii) more than 30 days following the date of

                months prior to the initiation of the administrative 
                action, except where the Administrator and the Attorney 
                General jointly determine that a matter involving a 
                larger penalty amount or longer period of violation is 
                appropriate for administrative penalty action. Any such 
                determination by the Administrator and the Attorney 
                General shall not be subject to judicial review.
          (2) Procedure.--
                  (A) Opportunity for a hearing.--An administrative 
                order under paragraph (1) shall be issued after 
                opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance 
                with sections 554 and 556 of title 5. The Administrator 
                shall issue reasonable rules for discovery and other 
                procedures for hearings under this paragraph. Before 
                issuing such an order, the Administrator shall give to 
                the person to be assessed an administrative penalty 
                written notice of the Administrator's proposal to issue 
                the order and provide the person an opportunity to 
                request a hearing on the order, within 30 days after 
                the date on which the notice is received by the person.
                  (B) Compromise, modification, or remission of 
                administrative penalty.--The Administrator may 
                compromise, modify, or remit, with or without 
                conditions, any administrative penalty that may be 
                imposed under this subsection.
          (3) Field citation program.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator may implement, 
                after consultation with the Attorney General and the 
                States, a field citation program through regulations 
                establishing appropriate minor violations for which 
                field citations assessing civil penalties not to exceed 
                $5,000 per day of violation may be issued by officers 
                or employees designated by the Administrator.
                  (B) Election to pay or request hearing.--Any person 
                to whom a field citation is assessed may, within a 
                reasonable time as prescribed by the Administrator by 
                regulation, elect to pay the penalty assessment or to 
                request a hearing on the field citation. If a request 
                for a hearing is not made within the time specified in 
                the regulation, the penalty assessment in the field 
                citation shall be final. Such a hearing shall not be 
                subject to section 554 or 556 of title 5, but shall 
                provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to 
                present evidence.
                  (C) No defense to further enforcement.--Payment of a 
                civil penalty required by a field citation shall not be 
                a defense to further enforcement by the United States 
                or a State to correct a violation, or to assess the 
                statutory maximum penalty pursuant to other authorities 
                in this division, if the violation continues.
          (4) Judicial review.--
                  (A) In general.--Any person against which a civil 
                penalty is assessed under paragraph (3) or to which an 
                administrative penalty order is issued under paragraph 
                (1) may seek review of the assessment in the United 
                States District Court for the District of Columbia or 
                for the district in which the violation is alleged to 
                have occurred, in which the person resides, or where 
                the person's principal place of business is located, by 
                filing in the court within 30 days after the date on 
                which the administrative penalty order becomes final 
                under paragraph (2), the assessment becomes final under 
                paragraph (3), or a final decision following a hearing 
                under paragraph (3) is rendered, and by simultaneously 
                sending a copy of the filing by certified mail to the 
                Administrator and the Attorney General.
                  (B) Record.--Within 30 days after the date of a 
                filing under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall 
                file in the court a certified copy, or certified index, 
                as appropriate, of the record on which the 
                administrative penalty order or assessment was issued.
                  (C) Scope of review.--The court shall not set aside 
                or remand the order or assessment unless there is not 
                substantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, 
                to support the finding of a violation or unless the 
                order or penalty assessment constitutes an abuse of 
                discretion.
                  (D) No other judicial review.--An order or penalty 
                assessment described in subparagraph (A) shall not be 
                subject to review by any court except as provided in 
                this paragraph.
                  (E) Recovery of civil penalties.--In any proceeding 
                under this paragraph, the United States may seek to 
                recover civil penalties ordered or assessed under this 
                section.
          (5) Failure to pay assessment or comply with administrative 
        order.--
                  (A) In general.--If any person fails to pay an 
                assessment of a civil penalty or fails to comply with 
                an administrative penalty order--
                          (i) after the order or assessment has become 
                        final; or
                          (ii) after a court in an action brought under 
                        paragraph (4) has entered a final judgment in 
                        favor of the Administrator;
                the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to 
                bring a civil action in an appropriate United States 
                district court to enforce the order or to recover the 
                amount ordered or assessed (plus interest at rates 
                established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) 
                from the date of the final order or decision or the 
                date of the final judgment, as the case may be).
                  (B) Validity, amount, and appropriateness not subject 
                to review.--In a civil action under subparagraph (A), 
                the validity, amount, and appropriateness of the order 
                or assessment shall not be subject to review.
                  (C) Enforcement expenses.--Any person that fails to 
                pay on a timely basis a civil penalty ordered or 
                assessed under this section shall be required to pay, 
                in addition to the civil penalty and interest, the 
                enforcement expenses of the United States, including 
                attorney's fees and costs incurred by the United States 
                for collection proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment 
                penalty for each quarter during which the failure to 
                pay persists. The nonpayment penalty shall be 10 
                percent of the aggregate amount of the person's 
                outstanding penalties and nonpayment penalties accrued 
                as of the beginning of each such quarter.
  (f) Penalty Assessment Criteria.--
          (1) Factors.--In determining the amount of any civil penalty 
        to be assessed under this section, the Administrator or the 
        court, as appropriate, shall take into consideration (in 
        addition to such other factors as justice may require)--
                  (A) the size of the business;
                  (B) the economic impact of the civil penalty on the 
                business;
                  (C) the violator's full compliance history and good 
                faith efforts to comply;
                  (D) the duration of the violation as established by 
                any credible evidence (including evidence other than 
                the applicable test method);
                  (E) payment by the violator of penalties previously 
                assessed for the same violation;
                  (F) the economic benefit of noncompliance; and
                  (G) the seriousness of the violation.
          (2) Limitation.--The court shall not assess a penalty for 
        noncompliance with an administrative subpoena under section 
        203102(a) of this title, or an action under section 211114 of 
        this title, where the violator had sufficient cause to violate 
        or fail or refuse to comply with the subpoena or action.
          (3) Civil penalty for each day of violation.--A civil penalty 
        may be assessed for each day of violation. For purposes of 
        determining the number of days of violation for which a civil 
        penalty may be assessed under subsection (c) or (e)(1) or 
        section 203104(b) of this title, where the Administrator or an 
        air pollution control agency has notified the source of the 
        violation, and the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that 
        the conduct or events giving rise to the violation are likely 
        to have continued or recurred past the date of notice, the days 
        of violation shall be presumed to include the date of the 
        notice and each day thereafter until the violator establishes 
        that continuous compliance has been achieved, except to the 
        extent that the violator can prove by a preponderance of the 
        evidence that there were intervening days during which no 
        violation occurred or that the violation was not continuing in 
        nature.
  (g) Awards.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may pay an award, not to 
        exceed $10,000, to any person that furnishes information or 
        services that lead to a criminal conviction or a judicial or 
        administrative civil penalty for any violation of this 
        subdivision or subdivision 1, 5, 6, or 7 enforced under this 
        section.
          (2) Availability of appropriations.--A payment under 
        paragraph (1) is subject to available appropriations for such 
        payments as provided in annual appropriation Acts.
          (3) Ineligibility of government officers and employees.--Any 
        officer or employee of the United States or any State or local 
        government who furnishes information or renders service in the 
        performance of an official duty is ineligible for payment under 
        this subsection.
          (4) Additional criteria.--The Administrator may, by 
        regulation, prescribe additional criteria for eligibility for 
        an award under this subsection.
  (h) Settlements; Public Participation.--
          (1) Opportunity to comment.--At least 30 days before a 
        consent order or settlement agreement of any kind under this 
        division to which the United States is a party (other than an 
        enforcement action under this section, section 211119 of this 
        title, or subdivision 3, whether or not involving civil or 
        criminal penalties, or judgments subject to Department of 
        Justice policy on public participation) is final or filed with 
        a court, the Administrator shall provide a reasonable 
        opportunity by notice in the Federal Register to persons that 
        are not named as parties or intervenors to the action or matter 
        to comment in writing.
          (2) Consideration of comments; withholding or withdrawal of 
        consent.--The Administrator or the Attorney General, as 
        appropriate--
                  (A) shall promptly consider any such written 
                comments; and
                  (B) may withdraw or withhold consent to the proposed 
                order or agreement if the comments disclose facts or 
                considerations that indicate that consent is 
                inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or inconsistent 
                with the requirements of this division.
          (3) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        apply to civil or criminal penalties under this division.
Sec. 211114. Recordkeeping, inspections, monitoring, and entry
  (a) Authority of Administrator or Authorized Representative.--
          (1) Purposes.--The Administrator may take the actions 
        described in paragraph (2) for the purpose of--
                  (A) developing or assisting in the development of--
                          (i) any implementation plan under section 
                        211110 or 211111(d) of this title;
                          (ii) any standard of performance under 
                        section 211111 of this title;
                          (iii) any emission standard under section 
                        211112 of this title; or
                          (iv) any regulation of solid waste combustion 
                        under section 211128 of this title;
                  (B) determining whether any person is in violation of 
                any such standard or any requirement of such a plan; or
                  (C) carrying out any provision of this division 
                (except a provision of subdivision 3 with respect to a 
                manufacturer of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
                engines).
          (2) Actions.--For any of the purposes stated in paragraph 
        (1)--
                  (A) the Administrator may require any person that 
                owns or operates any emission source, that manufactures 
                emission control equipment or process equipment, that 
                the Administrator believes may have information 
                necessary for the purposes set forth in this 
                subsection, or that is subject to any requirement of 
                this division (other than a manufacturer subject to the 
                provisions of section 221106(c) or 221108 of this title 
                with respect to a provision of subdivision 3) on a one-
                time, periodic, or continuous basis to--
                          (i) establish and maintain such records as 
                        the Administrator may reasonably require;
                          (ii) make such reports as the Administrator 
                        may reasonably require;
                          (iii) install, use, and maintain such 
                        monitoring equipment, and use such audit 
                        procedures, or methods, as the Administrator 
                        may reasonably require;
                          (iv) sample such emissions (in accordance 
                        with such procedures or methods, at such 
                        locations, at such intervals, during such 
                        periods and in such manner as the Administrator 
                        shall prescribe);
                          (v) keep records on control equipment 
                        parameters, production variables or other 
                        indirect data when direct monitoring of 
                        emissions is impractical;
                          (vi) submit compliance certifications in 
                        accordance with paragraph (3); and
                          (vii) provide such other information as the 
                        Administrator may reasonably require; and
                  (B) the Administrator or an authorized representative 
                of the Administrator, on presentation of his or her 
                credentials--
                          (i) shall have a right of entry to, on, or 
                        through any premises of a person described in 
                        subparagraph (A) or in which any records 
                        required to be maintained under subparagraph 
                        (A) are located; and
                          (ii) may at reasonable times have access to 
                        and copy any records, inspect any monitoring 
                        equipment or method required under subparagraph 
                        (A), and sample any emissions that a person is 
                        required to sample under subparagraph (A).
          (3) Enhanced monitoring; submission of compliance 
        certifications.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall, in the case 
                of any person that is the owner or operator of a major 
                stationary source, and may, in the case of any other 
                person, require enhanced monitoring and submission of 
                compliance certifications.
                  (B) Compliance certifications.--A compliance 
                certification shall include--
                          (i) identification of the applicable 
                        requirement that is the basis of the 
                        certification;
                          (ii) the method used for determining the 
                        compliance status of the source;
                          (iii) the compliance status;
                          (iv) whether compliance is continuous or 
                        intermittent; and
                          (v) such other facts as the Administrator may 
                        require.
                  (C) Effect of submission of compliance certificate.--
                Submission of a compliance certification shall in no 
                way limit the Administrator's authorities to 
                investigate or otherwise implement this division.
                  (D) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                regulations to provide guidance and to implement this 
                paragraph.
  (b) State Enforcement.--
          (1) In general.--A State may develop and submit to the 
        Administrator a procedure for carrying out this section in the 
        State. If the Administrator finds that the State procedure is 
        adequate, the Administrator may delegate to the State any 
        authority that the Administrator has to carry out this section.
          (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection 
        precludes the Administrator from carrying out this section in a 
        State.
  (c) Public Availability of Records, Reports, and Information.--
          (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), any 
        records, reports or information obtained under subsection (a) 
        shall be available to the public.
          (2) Trade secrets.--On a showing satisfactory to the 
        Administrator by any person that records, reports, or 
        information, or any particular part thereof (other than 
        emission data), to which the Administrator has access under 
        this section, if made public, would divulge methods or 
        processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of the 
        person, the Administrator shall consider the record, report, or 
        information or particular part thereof confidential in 
        accordance with section 1905 of title 18, except that the 
        record, report, or information may be disclosed to other 
        officers, employees, or authorized representatives of the 
        United States concerned with carrying out this division or when 
        relevant in any proceeding under this division.
  (d) Notice of Proposed Entry, Inspection, or Monitoring.--
          (1) In general.--In the case of any emission standard or 
        limitation or other requirement that is adopted by a State as 
        part of an applicable implementation plan, before carrying out 
        an entry, inspection, or monitoring under subsection (a)(2)(B) 
        with respect to the emission standard, limitation, or other 
        requirement, the Administrator (or the Administrator's 
        representative) shall provide the State air pollution control 
        agency with reasonable prior notice of that action, indicating 
        the purpose of the action.
          (2) Prohibition of use of information to inform affected 
        person.--No State air pollution control agency that receives 
        notice under paragraph (1) of an action proposed to be taken 
        may use the information contained in the notice to inform the 
        person whose property is proposed to be affected of the 
        proposed action. If the Administrator has a reasonable basis 
        for believing that a State air pollution control agency is so 
        using or will so use such information, notice to the State air 
        pollution control agency under paragraph (1) is not required 
        until such time as the Administrator determines that the State 
        air pollution control agency will no longer so use information 
        contained in a notice under paragraph (1).
          (3) Effect of section.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed to require notification to any State air pollution 
        control agency of any action taken by the Administrator with 
        respect to any standard, limitation, or other requirement that 
        is not part of an applicable implementation plan or that was 
        promulgated by the Administrator under section 211110(c) of 
        this title.
          (4) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        be construed to provide that any failure of the Administrator 
        to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be a 
        defense in any enforcement action brought by the Administrator 
        or shall make inadmissible as evidence in any such action any 
        information or material obtained notwithstanding the failure to 
        comply with those requirements.
Sec. 211115. International air pollution
  (a) Endangerment of Public Health or Welfare in Foreign Countries 
From Pollution Emitted in United States.--Whenever the Administrator, 
on receipt of reports, surveys, or studies from any duly constituted 
international agency, has reason to believe that any air pollutant or 
pollutants emitted in the United States cause or contribute to air 
pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health 
or welfare in a foreign country or whenever the Secretary of State 
requests the Administrator to do so with respect to such pollution that 
the Secretary of State alleges is of such a nature, the Administrator 
shall give formal notification thereof to the Governor of the State in 
which the emissions originate.
  (b) Prevention or Elimination of Endangerment.--The notice of the 
Administrator shall be deemed to be a finding under section 
211110(a)(3)(H)(ii) of this title that requires a plan revision with 
respect to so much of the applicable implementation plan as is 
inadequate to prevent or eliminate the endangerment described in 
subsection (a). Any foreign country so affected by the emission of the 
pollutant or pollutants shall be invited to appear at any public 
hearing associated with any revision of the appropriate portion of the 
applicable implementation plan.
  (c) Reciprocity.--This section shall apply only to a foreign country 
that the Administrator determines has given the United States 
essentially the same rights with respect to the prevention or control 
of air pollution occurring in that country as is given that country by 
this section.
  (d) Recommendations.--Recommendations issued following any abatement 
conference conducted prior to August 7, 1977, shall remain in effect 
with respect to any pollutant for which no NAAQS has been established 
under section 211109 of this title unless the Administrator, after 
consultation with all agencies that were party to the conference, 
rescinds any such recommendation on grounds of obsolescence.

                                U.S.C. 7419) (as in effect before the 
                                repeal of that section) that is not in

                        respect to a source described in clause 
                        (i)(III), the costs described in subsection 
                        (g)(1) shall be the economic value of 
                        noncompliance with the interim emission control 
                        requirement or the remaining steps in the

                        (i)(III).
                  (B) Exemptions if failure to comply is due to certain

                        any source shall be exempted from the duty to 
                        pay a noncompliance penalty under those 
                        requirements with respect to that source if, in 
                        accordance with the procedures in subsection

                        the failure of the source to comply with any 
                        such requirement is due solely to--
                                  (I) a conversion by the source from 
                                the burning of petroleum products or 
                                natural gas, or both, as the permanent

                                source granted an extension under the 
                                2d sentence of section 119(c)(1) of the

                                1990);
                                  (IV) an inability to comply with any 
                                such requirement, for which inability 
                                the source received an order under 
                                section 113(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 
                                U.S.C. 7413(d)) (as in effect before 
                                November 15, 1990) or an order under 
                                section 113 of the Clean Air Act (42 
                                U.S.C. 7413) (as in effect before 
                                August 7, 1977) that has the effect of 
                                permitting a delay or violation of any 
                                requirement of this division (including 
                                a requirement of an applicable 
                                implementation plan), which inability 
                                results from reasons entirely beyond 
                                the control of the owner or operator of 
                                the source or of any entity 
                                controlling, controlled by, or under 
                                common control with the owner or 
                                operator of the source; or
                                  (V) the conditions by reason of which 
                                a temporary emergency suspension is 
                                authorized under subsection (d) or (e) 
                                of section 211110 of this title.
                          (ii) Cessation of effectiveness.--An 
                        exemption under this subparagraph shall cease 
                        to be effective if the source fails to comply 
                        with the interim emission control requirements 
                        or schedules of compliance (including 
                        increments of progress) under any such 
                        extension, order, or suspension.
                  (C) Exemption if failure to comply is de minimis in 
                nature and in duration.--The Administrator may, after 
                notice and opportunity for public hearing, exempt any 
                source from the requirements of this section with 
                respect to a particular instance of noncompliance if 
                the Administrator finds that the instance of 
                noncompliance is de minimis in nature and in duration.
  (c) Contents of Regulations.--Regulations under subsection (b) 
shall--
          (1) permit the assessment and collection of a penalty by a 
        State if the State has a delegation of authority in effect 
        under subsection (b)(1)(B)(i);
          (2) provide for the assessment and collection of a penalty by 
        the Administrator, if--
                  (A) a State does not have a delegation of authority 
                in effect under subsection (b)(1)(B)(i); or
                  (B) a State has such a delegation in effect but fails 
                with respect to any particular person or source to 
                assess or collect the penalty in accordance with the 
                requirements of this section;
          (3) require a State, or if a State fails to do so, the 
        Administrator, to give a brief but reasonably specific notice 
        of noncompliance under this section to each person described in 
        subsection (b)(2)(A)(i) with respect to each source owned or 
        operated by the person that is not in compliance as provided in 
        subsection (b) not later than 30 days after the discovery of 
        the noncompliance;
          (4) require each person to which notice is given under 
        paragraph (3) to--
                  (A) calculate the amount of the penalty owed 
                (determined in accordance with subsection (g)(1)) and 
                the schedule of payments (determined in accordance with 
                subsection (g)(2)) for each such source and, within 45 
                days after the issuance of the notice or after the 
                denial of a petition under subparagraph (B), to submit 
                that calculation and proposed schedule, together with 
                the information necessary for an independent 
                verification of the calculation, to the State and to 
                the Administrator; or
                  (B) submit a petition, within 45 days after the 
                issuance of the notice, challenging the notice or 
                alleging entitlement to an exemption under subsection 
                (b)(2)(B) with respect to a particular source;
          (5) require the Administrator to provide a hearing on the 
        record (within the meaning of subchapter II of chapter 5 of 
        title 5) and to make a decision on the petition (including 
        findings of fact and conclusions of law) not later than 90 days 
        after the receipt of any petition under paragraph (4)(B), 
        unless the State agrees to provide a hearing that is 
        substantially similar to such a hearing on the record and to 
        make a decision on the petition (including findings and 
        conclusions) within the 90-day period;
          (6)(A) authorize the Administrator on the Administrator's 
        initiative to review the decision of the State under paragraph 
        (5) and disapprove the decision if it is not in accordance with 
        the requirements of this section; and
          (B) on petition for such a review, require the Administrator 
        to do so not later than 60 days after receipt of the petition, 
        notice, and public hearing and a showing by the petitioner that 
        the State decision under paragraph (5) is not in accordance 
        with the requirements of this section;
          (7) require payment, in accordance with subsections (f) and 
        (g), of the penalty by each person to which notice of 
        noncompliance is given under paragraph (3) with respect to each 
        noncomplying source for which the notice is given unless there 
        has been a final determination granting a petition under 
        paragraph (4)(B) with respect to the source;
          (8) authorize a State or the Administrator to adjust (and 
        from time to time to readjust) the amount of the penalty 
        assessment calculated or the payment schedule proposed by an 
        owner or operator under paragraph (4) if the Administrator 
        finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the 
        record, that the penalty or schedule does not meet the 
        requirements of this section; and
          (9) require a final adjustment of the penalty within 180 days 
        after a source comes into compliance in accordance with 
        subsection (g)(3).
  (d) Noncompliance Penalty Established by a State.--
          (1) Notice.--In any case in which a State establishes a 
        noncompliance penalty under this section, the State shall 
        provide notice of the noncompliance penalty to the 
        Administrator.
          (2) Applicability.--A noncompliance penalty established by a 
        State under this section shall apply unless the Administrator, 
        within 90 days after the date of receipt of notice of the State 
        penalty assessment under this section, objects in writing to 
        the amount of the penalty as less than would be required to 
        comply with guidelines established by the Administrator.
          (3) Objection.--If the Administrator objects, the 
        Administrator shall immediately establish a substitute 
        noncompliance penalty applicable to the source.
  (e) Contract To Assist in Determining Amount of Penalty Assessment or 
Payment Schedule.--
          (1) In general.--If the owner or operator of any stationary 
        source to which a notice is issued under subsection (c)(3)--
                  (A)(i) does not submit a timely petition under 
                subsection (c)(4)(B); or
                  (ii) submits a petition under subsection (c)(4)(B) 
                that is denied; and
                  (B) fails to submit a calculation of the penalty 
                assessment, a schedule for payment, and the information 
                necessary for independent verification of the 
                calculation;
        the State (or the Administrator, as the case may be) may enter 
        into a contract with any person that has no financial interest 
        in the owner or operator of the source (or in any person 
        controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
        source) to assist in determining the amount of the penalty 
        assessment or payment schedule with respect to the source.
          (2) Cost.--The cost of carrying out a contract under 
        paragraph (1) may be added to the penalty to be assessed 
        against the owner or operator of the source.
  (f) Payment.--All penalties assessed by the Administrator under this 
section shall be paid to the Treasury. All penalties assessed by a 
State under this section shall be paid to the State.
  (g) Amount of Penalty.--
          (1) Amount.--
                  (A) In general.--The amount of the penalty that shall 
                be assessed and collected with respect to any source 
                under this section shall be equal to--
                          (i) the amount determined in accordance with 
                        regulations promulgated by the Administrator 
                        under subsection (b), which is not less than 
                        the economic value that a delay in compliance 
                        may have for the owner of the source, 
                        including--
                                  (I) the quarterly equivalent of the 
                                capital costs of compliance and debt 
                                service over a normal amortization 
                                period, not to exceed 10 years;
                                  (II) operation and maintenance costs 
                                forgone as a result of noncompliance; 
                                and
                                  (III) any additional economic value 
                                that such a delay may have for the 
                                owner or operator of the source; minus
                          (ii) the amount of any expenditure made by 
                        the owner or operator of the source during any 
                        such quarter for the purpose of bringing the 
                        source into, and maintaining compliance with, 
                        the requirement, to the extent that the 
                        expenditure is not taken into account in the 
                        calculation of the penalty under clause (i).
                  (B) Subtraction of expenditure.--To the extent that 
                any expenditure under subparagraph (A)(ii) made during 
                any quarter is not subtracted for that quarter from the 
                costs under subparagraph (A)(i), the expenditure may be 
                subtracted for any subsequent quarter from those costs.
                  (C) Minimum amount.--In no event shall the amount 
                paid be less than the quarterly payment minus the 
                amount attributed to actual cost of construction.
          (2) Payment in installments.--
                  (A) Definition of period of covered noncompliance.--
                In this paragraph, the term ``period of covered 
                noncompliance'' means the period that begins on the 
                date of issuance of a notice of noncompliance under 
                subsection (c)(3) and ending on the date on which the 
                source comes into (or for the purpose of establishing 
                the schedule of payments, is estimated to come into) 
                compliance with the requirement.
                  (B) In general.--The assessed penalty required under 
                this section shall be paid in quarterly installments 
                for the period of covered noncompliance. All quarterly 
                payments (determined without regard to any adjustment 
                or any subtraction under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)) after 
                the 1st payment shall be equal.
                  (C) 1st payment.--The 1st payment shall be due on the 
                date that is 6 months after the date of issuance of the 
                notice of noncompliance under subsection (b)(3) with 
                respect to any source. The 1st payment shall be in the 
                amount of the quarterly installment for the upcoming 
                quarter, plus the amount owed for any preceding period 
                within the period of covered noncompliance for the 
                source.
          (3) Review of actual expenditures.--On making a determination 
        that a source with respect to which a penalty has been paid 
        under this section is in compliance and is maintaining 
        compliance with the applicable requirement, a State (or the 
        Administrator as the case may be) shall--
                  (A) review the actual expenditures made by the owner 
                or operator of the source for the purpose of attaining 
                and maintaining compliance; and
                  (B) within 180 days after the source comes into 
                compliance--
                          (i) provide reimbursement with interest (to 
                        be paid by the State or Secretary of the 
                        Treasury, as the case may be) at appropriate 
                        prevailing rates (as determined by the 
                        Secretary of the Treasury) for any overpayment 
                        by the owner or operator; or
                          (ii) assess and collect an additional payment 
                        with interest at appropriate prevailing rates 
                        (as determined by the Secretary of the 
                        Treasury) for any underpayment by the owner or 
                        operator.
          (4) Quarterly nonpayment penalty.--An owner or operator that 
        fails to pay the amount of any penalty with respect to any 
        source under this section on a timely basis shall be required 
        to pay in addition a quarterly nonpayment penalty for each 
        quarter during which the failure to pay persists. The 
        nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal to 20 percent of 
        the aggregate amount of the owner or operator's penalties and 
        nonpayment penalties with respect to the source that are unpaid 
        as of the beginning of the quarter.
  (h) Judicial Review.--Any action pursuant to this section, including 
any objection of the Administrator under subsection (d)(3), shall be 
considered a final action for purposes of judicial review of any 
penalty under section 211113 of this title.
  (i) Other Orders, Payments, Sanctions, or Requirements.--Any orders, 
payments, sanctions, or other requirements under this section shall be 
in addition to any other permits, orders, payments, sanctions, or other 
requirements established under this division and shall in no way affect 
any civil or criminal enforcement proceedings brought under any 
provision of this division or State or local law.
  (j) More Stringent Emission Limitations or Other Requirements.--In 
the case of any emission limitation or other requirement approved or 
promulgated by the Administrator under this division after August 7, 
1977, that is more stringent than the emission limitation or 
requirement for the source in effect prior to such approval or 
promulgation, if any, or where there was no emission limitation or 
requirement approved or promulgated before August 7, 1977, the date for 
imposition of the noncompliance penalty under this section shall be the 
date on which the source is required to be in full compliance with the 
emission limitation or requirement, but in no event later than 3 years 
after the approval or promulgation of the emission limitation or 
requirement.
  (k) Determination of Number of Days.--For purposes of determining the 
number of days of violation for which an assessment may be made under 
this section, where the Administrator or an air pollution control 
agency has notified the source of the violation, and the plaintiff 
makes a prima facie showing that the conduct or events giving rise to 
the violation are likely to have continued or recurred past the date of 
notice, the days of violation shall be presumed to include the date of 
the notice and each day thereafter until the violator establishes that 
continuous compliance has been achieved, except to the extent that the 
violator can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there were 
intervening days during which no violation occurred or that the 
violation was not continuing in nature.
Sec. 211120. Consultation
  (a) Process.--In carrying out the requirements of this division 
requiring applicable implementation plans to contain--
          (1) any transportation controls, air quality maintenance plan 
        requirements, or preconstruction review of direct sources of 
        air pollution; or
          (2) any measure described in chapter 213 or 215;
a State shall provide a satisfactory process of consultation with 
general purpose local governments, designated organizations of elected 
officials of local governments, and any Federal land manager having 
authority over Federal land to which the State plan applies, as part of 
the plan.
  (b) Regulations.--The process provided under subsection (a) shall be 
in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator to 
ensure adequate consultation.
  (c) Judicial Review.--Only a general purpose unit of local 
government, regional agency, or council of governments adversely 
affected by action of the Administrator approving any portion of a plan 
described in subsection (a) may petition for judicial review of an 
action described in subsection (a) on the basis of a violation of the 
requirements of this section.
Sec. 211121. Listing of certain unregulated pollutants
  (a) Radioactive Pollutants, Cadmium, Arsenic, and Polycyclic Organic 
Matter.--
          (1) Review and determination.--After notice and opportunity 
        for public hearing, the Administrator shall review all 
        available relevant information and determine whether emissions 
        of radioactive pollutants (including source material, special 
        nuclear material, and byproduct material), cadmium, arsenic, 
        and polycyclic organic matter into the ambient air will cause, 
        or contribute to, air pollution that may reasonably be 
        anticipated to endanger public health.
          (2) Affirmative determination.--If the Administrator makes an 
        affirmative determination with respect to a substance described 
        in paragraph (1), the Administrator, simultaneously with the 
        determination, shall--
                  (A) include the substance in the list published under 
                section 211108(a)(1) or 211112(b)(1) of this title (in 
                the case of a substance that, in the judgment of the 
                Administrator, causes, or contributes to, air pollution 
                that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an 
                increase in mortality or an increase in serious 
                irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness);
                  (B) include each category of stationary sources 
                emitting the substance in significant amounts in the 
                list published under section 211111(b)(1) of this 
                title, or take any combination of such actions; or
                  (C) take both such actions.
  (b) Revision Authority.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed 
to affect the authority of the Administrator to revise any list 
described in subsection (a) with respect to any substance (whether or 
not enumerated in subsection (a)).
  (c) Source Material, Special Nuclear Material, and Byproduct 
Material.--
          (1) Consultation.--Before listing any source material,

        division respecting the emission of source material, special 
        nuclear material, or byproduct material (and components and 
        derivatives thereof) from those sources or facilities.
          (3) Public health and safety.--In case of any standard or 
        emission limitation promulgated by the Administrator, under 
        this division or by any State (or the Administrator) under any 
        applicable implementation plan under this division, if the 
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines, after notice and 
        opportunity for public hearing that the application of the 
        standard or limitation to a source or facility under the 
        jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would 
        endanger public health or safety, the standard or limitation 
        shall not apply to those facilities or sources unless the 
        President determines otherwise within 90 days after the date of 
        the determination.
Sec. 211122. Stack heights
  (a) Definitions.--In this section:
          (1) Dispersion technique.--The term ``dispersion technique'' 
        includes any intermittent or supplemental control of an air 
        pollutant varying with atmospheric conditions.
          (2) Good engineering practice.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``good engineering 
                practice'', with respect to the height of a stack at a 
                source, means the height necessary to ensure that 
                emissions from the stack do not result in excessive 
                concentrations of any air pollutant in the immediate 
                vicinity of the source as a result of atmospheric 
                downwash, eddies, and wakes that may be created by the 
                source itself, nearby structures, or nearby terrain 
                obstacles (as determined by the Administrator).
                  (B) Limitation.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), 
                stack height consistent with good engineering practice 
                shall not exceed 2\1/2\ times the height of a source 
                unless the owner or operator of the source 
                demonstrates, after notice and opportunity for public 
                hearing, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that 
                a greater height is necessary as provided under 
                subparagraph (A).
  (b) Heights in Excess of Good Engineering Practice; Other Dispersion 
Techniques.--
          (1) In general.--The degree of emission limitation required 
        for control of any air pollutant under an applicable 
        implementation plan under this subdivision shall not be 
        affected in any manner by--
                  (A) so much of the stack height of any source as 
                exceeds good engineering practice (as determined under 
                regulations promulgated by the Administrator); or
                  (B) any other dispersion technique.
          (2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with 
        respect to stack heights in existence before December 31, 1970, 
        or dispersion techniques implemented before that date.
          (3) Emission limitation for certain coal-fired steam electric 
        generating units.--In establishing an emission limitation for 
        coal-fired steam electric generating units are subject to 
        section 211118 of this title and that commenced operation 
        before July 1, 1957, the effect of the entire stack height of 
        stacks for which a construction contract was awarded before 
        February 8, 1974, may be taken into account.
  (c) Limitation.--In no event may the Administrator prohibit any 
increase in any stack height or restrict in any manner the stack height 
of any source.
  (d) Regulations.--After notice and opportunity for public hearing, 
the Administrator shall promulgate regulations to carry out this 
section.
Sec. 211123. Assurance of adequacy of State plans
  (a) State Review of Implementation Plans That Relate to Major Fuel 
Burning Sources.--Each State shall review the provisions of its 
implementation plan that relate to major fuel burning sources and shall 
determine--
          (1) the extent to which compliance with requirements of the 
        implementation plan is dependent on the use by major fuel 
        burning stationary sources of petroleum products or natural 
        gas;
          (2) the extent to which the implementation plan may 
        reasonably be anticipated to be inadequate to meet the 
        requirements of this division in the State on a reliable and 
        long-term basis by reason of its dependence on the use of 
        petroleum products or natural gas; and
          (3) the extent to which compliance with the requirements of 
        the implementation plan is dependent on use of coal or coal 
        derivatives that is not locally or regionally available.
  (b) Submission to Administrator.--Each State shall submit the results 
of its review and its determination under subsection (a) to the 
Administrator promptly on completion of the review.
  (c) Plan Revision.--
          (1) Revision.--The Administrator shall review the submissions 
        of the States under subsection (b) and shall require a State to 
        revise its implementation plan if, in the judgment of the 
        Administrator, revision is necessary to ensure that the 
        implementation plan will be adequate to ensure compliance with 
        the requirements of this division in the State on a reliable 
        and long-term basis, taking into account the actual or 
        potential prohibitions on use of petroleum products or natural 
        gas, or both, under any other authority of law.
          (2) Considerations; consultation.--Before requiring an 
        implementation plan revision under this subsection with respect 
        to any State, the Administrator shall--
                  (A) take into account the report of the review 
                conducted by the State under paragraph (1); and
                  (B) consult with the Governor of the State respecting 
                the required revision.

                        electric energy and steam or forms of useful 
                        energy (such as heat) that are used for 
                        industrial, commercial, heating or cooling 
                        purposes; or
                          (iv) an air curtain incinerator, if the air 
                        curtain incinerator burns only wood waste, yard 
                        waste, and clean lumber and complies with 
                        opacity limitations established by the 
                        Administrator by regulation.
          (10) Unit.--The term ``unit'' means a solid waste 
        incineration unit.
  (b) New Source Performance Standards.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator shall establish 
        performance standards and other requirements pursuant to this 
        section and section 211111 of this title for each category of 
        solid waste incineration units. The standards shall include 
        emission limitations and other requirements applicable to new 
        units and guidelines (under section 211111(d) of this title and 
        this section) and other requirements applicable to existing 
        units.
          (2) Emission standard.--
                  (A) Maximum degree of reduction in emissions.--
                Standards applicable to solid waste incineration units 
                promulgated under this section and section 211111 of 
                this title shall reflect the maximum degree of 
                reduction in emissions of air pollutants listed under 
                paragraph (4) that the Administrator, taking into 
                consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
                reduction, and any non-air-quality health and 
                environmental impacts and energy requirements, 
                determines is achievable for new units or existing 
                units in each category.
                  (B) Classes, types, and sizes of units.--The 
                Administrator may distinguish among classes, types 
                (including mass-burn, refuse-derived fuel, modular, and 
                other types of units), and sizes of units within a 
                category in establishing the standards.
                  (C) Stringency.--The degree of reduction in emissions 
                that is considered achievable for new units in a 
                category shall not be less stringent than the emission 
                control that is achieved in practice by the best 
                controlled similar unit, as determined by the 
                Administrator. Emission standards for existing units in 
                a category may be less stringent than standards for new 
                units in the same category but shall not be less 
                stringent than the average emission limitation achieved 
                by the best performing 12 percent of units in the 
                category (excluding units that first met lowest 
                achievable emission rates 18 months before the date on 
                which the emission standards are proposed or 30 months 
                before the date on which the emission standards are 
                promulgated, whichever is later).
          (3) Control methods and technologies.--Standards under this 
        section and section 211111 of this title applicable to solid 
        waste incineration units shall--
                  (A) be based on methods and technologies for removal 
                or destruction of pollutants before, during, or after 
                combustion; and
                  (B) incorporate for new units siting requirements 
                that minimize, on a site-specific basis, to the maximum 
                extent practicable, potential risks to public health or 
                the environment.
          (4) Numerical emission limitations.--
                  (A) In general.--The performance standards 
                promulgated under this section and section 211111 of 
                this title and applicable to solid waste incineration 
                units shall specify numerical emission limitations for 
                the following:
                          (i) particulate matter (total and fine);
                          (ii) opacity (as appropriate);
                          (iii) sulfur dioxide;
                          (iv) hydrogen chloride;
                          (v) nitrogen oxides;
                          (vi) carbon monoxide;
                          (vii) lead;
                          (viii) cadmium;
                          (ix) mercury; and
                          (x) dioxins and dibenzofurans.
                  (B) Surrogate substances.--The Administrator may 
                promulgate numerical emission limitations or provide 
                for the monitoring of postcombustion concentrations of 
                surrogate substances, parameters, or periods of 
                residence time in excess of stated temperatures with 
                respect to pollutants other than those listed in this 
                paragraph.
          (5) Review and revision.--Not later than 5 years after the 
        initial promulgation of any performance standards and other 
        requirements under this section and section 211111 of this 
        title applicable to a category of units, and at 5 year 
        intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall review, and in 
        accordance with this section and section 211111 of this title, 
        revise the standards and requirements.
  (c) Existing Units.--
          (1) Guidelines.--Performance standards under this section and 
        section 211111 of this title for units shall include guidelines 
        promulgated pursuant to this section and section 211111(d) of 
        this title applicable to existing units. The guidelines shall 
        include, as provided in this section, each of the elements 
        required by subsections (b) (notwithstanding any restriction in 
        section 211111(d) of this title regarding issuance of such 
        limitations), (d), (e), (f), and (h)(3).
          (2) State plans.--Not later than 1 year after the 
        Administrator promulgates guidelines for a category of units, a 
        State in which units in the category are operating shall submit 
        to the Administrator a plan to implement and enforce the 
        guidelines with respect to that category of units. The State 
        plan shall be at least as protective as the guidelines 
        promulgated by the Administrator and shall provide that each 
        unit subject to the guidelines shall be in compliance with all 
        requirements of this section not later than 3 years after the 
        State plan is approved by the Administrator but not later than 
        5 years after the guidelines are promulgated. The Administrator 
        shall approve or disapprove any State plan within 180 days of 
        the submission, and if a plan is disapproved, the Administrator 
        shall state the reasons for disapproval in writing. A State may 
        modify and resubmit a plan that has been disapproved by the 
        Administrator.
          (3) Federal plan.--The Administrator shall develop, 
        implement, and enforce a plan for existing units within any 
        category located in any State that has not submitted an 
        approvable plan under this subsection with respect to units in 
        that category within 2 years after the date on which the 
        Administrator promulgated the relevant guidelines. The plan 
        shall ensure that each unit subject to the plan is in 
        compliance with all provisions of the guidelines not later than 
        5 years after the date on which the relevant guidelines are 
        promulgated.
  (d) Monitoring.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, as part of each 
        performance standard promulgated pursuant to subsection (b) and 
        section 211111 of this title, promulgate regulations requiring 
        the owner or operator of each solid waste incineration unit--
                  (A) to monitor emissions from the unit at the point 
                at which the emissions are emitted into the ambient air 
                (or within the stack, combustion chamber, or pollution 
                control equipment, as appropriate) and at such other 
                points as are necessary to protect public health and 
                the environment;
                  (B) to monitor such other parameters relating to the 
                operation of the unit and its pollution control 
                technology as the Administrator determines are 
                appropriate; and
                  (C) to report the results of the monitoring.
          (2) Contents.--The regulations shall--
                  (A) contain provisions regarding the frequency of 
                monitoring, test methods, and procedures validated on 
                solid waste incineration units, and the form and 
                frequency of reports containing the results of 
                monitoring;
                  (B) require that any monitoring reports or test 
                results indicating an exceedance of any standard under 
                this section be reported separately and in a manner 
                that facilitates review for purposes of enforcement 
                actions; and
                  (C) require that copies of the results of the 
                monitoring be maintained on file at the facility 
                concerned and that copies be made available for 
                inspection and copying by members of the public during 
                business hours.
  (e) Operator Training.--The Administrator shall develop and promote a 
model State program for the training and certification of unit 
operators and high-capacity fossil fuel-fired plant operators. The 
Administrator may authorize any State to implement a model program for 
the training of unit operators and high-capacity fossil fuel-fired 
plant operators if the State adopts a program that is at least as 
effective as the model program developed by the Administrator. 
Beginning on the date 36 months after the date on which performance 
standards and guidelines are promulgated under subsection (b) and 
section 211111 of this title for any category of units, it shall be 
unlawful to operate any unit in the category unless each person with 
control over processes affecting emissions from the unit has 
satisfactorily completed a training program meeting the requirements 
established by the Administrator under this subsection.
  (f) Permits.--
          (1) In general.--Beginning on the later of--
                  (A) the date that is 36 months after the promulgation 
                of a performance standard under subsection (b) and 
                section 211111 of this title applicable to a category 
                of units; or
                  (B) the effective date of a permit program under 
                subdivision 6 in the State in which the unit is 
                located;
        each unit in the category shall operate pursuant to a permit 
        issued under this subsection and subdivision 6.
          (2) Renewal.--A permit required by this subsection may be 
        renewed under subdivision 6.
          (3) Duration.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        division, a permit for a unit combusting municipal waste issued 
        under this division shall be issued for a period of up to 12 
        years and shall be reviewed every 5 years after date of 
        issuance or reissuance. A permit shall continue in effect after 
        the date of issuance until the date of termination, unless the 
        Administrator or State determines that the unit is not in 
        compliance with all standards and conditions contained in the 
        permit. Such a determination shall be made at regular intervals 
        of not more than 5 years during the term of the permit, after 
        public comment and public hearing.
          (4) Limitation.--No permit for a unit may be issued under 
        this division by an agency, instrumentality, or person that is 
        also responsible, in whole or part, for the design and 
        construction or operation of the unit.
          (5) Compliance with emission limitations or implementation of 
        other measures.--
                  (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
                of this subsection, the Administrator or the State 
                shall require the owner or operator of any unit to 
                comply with emission limitations or implement any other 
                measures, if the Administrator or the State determines 
                that emissions in the absence of such limitations or 
                measures may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
                public health or the environment.
                  (B) Discretionary decision.--The Administrator's 
                determination under subparagraph (A) is a discretionary 
                decision.
  (g) Effective Date and Enforcement.--
          (1) New units.--Performance standards and other requirements 
        promulgated pursuant to this section and section 211111 of this 
        title and applicable to new solid waste incineration units 
        shall be effective as of the date that is 6 months after the 
        date of promulgation.
          (2) Existing units.--Performance standards and other 
        requirements promulgated pursuant to this section and section 
        211111 of this title and applicable to existing units shall be 
        effective as expeditiously as practicable after approval of a 
        State plan under subsection (c)(2) (or promulgation of a plan 
        by the Administrator under subsection (c)(3)) but in no event 
        later than 3 years after the State plan is approved or 5 years 
        after the date on which the standards or requirements are 
        promulgated, whichever is earlier.
          (3) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any owner or 
        operator of any solid waste incineration unit to which a 
        performance standard, emission limitation, or other requirement 
        promulgated pursuant to this section and section 211111 of this 
        title applies to operate the unit in violation of the 
        performance standard, emission limitation, or requirement or 
        for any other person to violate an applicable requirement of 
        this section.
          (4) Coordination with other authorities.--For purposes of 
        sections 203102, 203103, 203104, 211111(j), 211113, 211114, 
        211116, and 211119 of this title and other provisions for the

        emission limitation, or other requirement established pursuant 
        to this section by the Administrator or a State or local 
        government shall be treated in the same manner as a standard of 
        performance under section 211111 of this title that is an 
        emission limitation.
  (h) Other Authority.--
          (1) State authority.--Nothing in this section shall preclude 
        or deny the right of any State or political subdivision thereof 
        to adopt or enforce any regulation, requirement, limitation, or 
        standard relating to solid waste incineration units that is 
        more stringent than a regulation, requirement, limitation, or 
        standard in effect under this section or under any other 
        provision of this division.
          (2) Other authority under this division.--Nothing in this 
        section shall diminish the authority of the Administrator or a 
        State to establish any other requirements applicable to solid 
        waste incineration units under any other authority of law, 
        including the authority to establish for any air pollutant a 
        NAAQS, except that no solid waste incineration unit subject to

the Administrator shall review and, if necessary, revise, the emission 
factors for carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen 
oxides from sources of those air pollutants (including area sources and 
mobile sources).
  (c) Additional Emission Factors.--The Administrator shall establish 
emission factors for sources for which no emission factors have 
previously been established by the Administrator.
  (d) Emissions Estimating Techniques.--The Administrator shall permit 
any person to demonstrate improved emissions estimating techniques, and 
following approval of such techniques, the Administrator shall 
authorize the use of the techniques. Any such technique may be approved 
only after appropriate public participation.
Sec. 211130. Land use authority

Sec. 213101. Purposes
  The purposes of this chapter are--
          (1) to protect public health and welfare from any actual or 
        potential adverse effect that in the Administrator's judgment 
        may reasonably be anticipated to occur from air pollution or 
        from exposures to pollutants in other media, which pollutants 
        originate as emissions to the ambient air, notwithstanding 
        attainment and maintenance of all NAAQSes;
          (2) to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality in 
        national parks, national wilderness areas, national monuments, 
        national seashores, and other areas of special national or 
        regional natural, recreational, scenic, or historic value;
          (3) to ensure that economic growth will occur in a manner 
        consistent with the preservation of existing clean air 
        resources;
          (4) to ensure that emissions from any source in any State 
        will not interfere with any portion of the applicable 
        implementation plan to prevent significant deterioration of air 
        quality for any other State; and
          (5) to ensure that any decision to permit increased air 
        pollution in any area to which this chapter applies is made 
        only after careful evaluation of all the consequences of such a 
        decision and after adequate procedural opportunities for 
        informed public participation in the decisionmaking process.
Sec. 213102. Definitions
  In this chapter:
          (1) Baseline concentration.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``baseline concentration'' 
                means, with respect to a pollutant, the ambient

                application for a permit in an area subject to this 
                chapter, based on air quality data available in EPA or 
                a State air pollution control agency and on such 
                monitoring data as the permit applicant is required to 
                submit.

                each pollutant subject to regulation under this 
                division emitted from or that results from any major 
                emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a 
                case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, 
                environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, 
                determines is achievable for the major emitting 
                facility through application of production processes

                that will exceed the emissions allowed by any 
                applicable standard established pursuant to section 
                211111 or 211112 of this title; and
                  (C) does not allow emissions from any source 
                utilizing clean fuels, or any other means, to comply 
                with this paragraph to increase above levels that would 
                have been required under section 169(3) of the Clean 
                Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7479(3)) as in effect before 
                November 15, 1990.

  (c) Orders or Regulations for Determining Compliance With Maximum 
Allowable Increases in Ambient Concentrations of Air Pollutants.--
          (1) Concentrations of certain pollutants not taken into 
        account.--In the case of any State that has a plan approved by 
        the Administrator for purposes of carrying out this chapter, 
        the Governor of the State may, after notice and opportunity for 
        public hearing, issue orders or promulgate regulations 
        providing that for purposes of determining compliance with the 
        maximum allowable increases in ambient concentrations of an air 
        pollutant, the following concentrations of the pollutant shall 
        not be taken into account:
                  (A) Concentrations of the pollutant attributable to 
                the increase in emissions from stationary sources that 
                have converted from the use of petroleum products, or 
                natural gas, or both, by reason of an order that is in 
                effect under subsections (a) and (b) of section 2 of 
                the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 
                1974 (15 U.S.C. 792) (or any subsequent legislation 
                that supersedes those subsections) over the emissions 
                from those stationary sources before the effective date 
                of the order.
                  (B) Concentrations of the pollutant attributable to 
                the increase in emissions from stationary sources that 
                have converted from using natural gas by reason of a 
                natural gas curtailment pursuant to a natural gas 
                curtailment plan in effect pursuant to the Federal 
                Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.) over the emissions 
                from those stationary sources before the effective date 
                of the plan.
                  (C) Concentrations of particulate matter attributable 
                to the increase in emissions from construction or other 
                temporary emission-related activities.
                  (D) The increase in concentrations attributable to 
                new sources outside the United States over the 
                concentrations attributable to existing sources that 
                are included in the baseline concentration.
          (2) Time period.--No action taken with respect to a source 
        under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) shall apply more 
        than 5 years after the effective date of an order described in 
        paragraph (1)(A) or the plan described to in paragraph (1)(B), 
        whichever is applicable. If both such an order and such a plan 
        are applicable, no such action shall apply more than 5 years 
        after the later of the effective dates.
          (3) Submission to the administrator.--No action under this 
        subsection shall take effect unless the Governor submits the 
        order or regulation providing for an exclusion to the 
        Administrator and the Administrator determines that the order 
        or regulation is in compliance with this subsection.

                          (i)(I) the redesignation has been 
                        specifically approved by the Governor of the 
                        State, after consultation with the appropriate 
                        committees of the legislature if it is in 
                        session or with the leadership of the 
                        legislature if it is not in session (unless 
                        State law provides that such redesignation must 
                        be specifically approved by State legislation); 
                        and
                          (II) general purpose units of local 
                        government representing a majority of the 
                        residents of the area to be redesignated enact 
                        legislation (including for such units of local 
                        government resolutions where appropriate) 
                        concurring in the State's redesignation;
                          (ii) the redesignation will not cause, or 
                        contribute to, concentrations of any air 
                        pollutant that exceed any maximum allowable 
                        increase or maximum allowable concentration 
                        permitted under the classification of any other 
                        area; and
                          (iii) the redesignation otherwise meets the 
                        requirements of this chapter.
                  (B) Indian tribes.--Subparagraph (A)(i)(I) does not 
                apply to area redesignations by an Indian tribe.
  (b) Procedure.--
          (1) Notice and hearing; notice to federal land manager; 
        written comments and recommendations; regulations; disapproval 
        of redesignation.--
                  (A) Notice of hearing.--Prior to redesignation of any 
                area under this chapter, notice shall be afforded and 
                public hearings shall be conducted in areas proposed to 
                be redesignated and in areas that may be affected by 
                the proposed redesignation. Prior to any such public 
                hearing, a satisfactory description and analysis of the 
                health, environmental, economic, social, and energy 
                effects of the proposed redesignation shall be prepared 
                and made available for public inspection, and prior to 
                any such redesignation, the description and analysis of 
                those effects shall be reviewed and examined by the 
                redesignating authorities.
                  (B) Federal land managers.--Prior to the issuance of 
                notice under subparagraph (A) respecting the 
                redesignation of any area under this subsection, if the 
                area includes any Federal land, the State shall provide 
                written notice to the appropriate Federal land manager 
                and afford adequate opportunity (but not in excess of 
                60 days) to confer with the State respecting the 
                intended notice of redesignation and to submit written 
                comments and recommendations with respect to the 
                intended notice of redesignation. In redesignating any 
                area under this section with respect to which a Federal 
                land manager has submitted written comments and 
                recommendations, the State shall publish a list of any 
                inconsistency between the redesignation and the 
                recommendations and an explanation of the inconsistency 
                (including the reasons for making the redesignation 
                against the recommendation of the Federal land 
                manager).
                  (C) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                regulations to ensure, insofar as practicable, that 
                prior to any public hearing on redesignation of any 
                area, there shall be available for public inspection 
                any specific plans for any new or modified major 
                emitting facility that may be permitted to be 
                constructed and operated only if the area is designated 
                or redesignated as class III.
          (2) Disapproval of redesignation.--The Administrator may 
        disapprove the redesignation of any area only if the 
        Administrator finds, after notice and opportunity for public 
        hearing, that the redesignation does not meet the procedural 
        requirements of this section or is inconsistent with the 
        requirements of section 213104(a) of this title or of 
        subsection (a). If any such disapproval occurs, the 
        classification of the area shall be that which was in effect 
        prior to the redesignation that was disapproved.
  (c) Indian Reservations.--Land within the exterior boundaries of a 
reservation of a federally recognized Indian tribe may be redesignated 
only by the appropriate Indian governing body.
  (d) Resolution of Disputes Between States and Indian Tribes.--
          (1) Negotiations.--If any State affected by the redesignation 
        of an area by an Indian tribe or any Indian tribe affected by 
        the redesignation of an area by a State disagrees with the 
        redesignation of any area, or if a permit is proposed to be 
        issued for any new major emitting facility proposed for 
        construction in any State that the Governor of an affected 
        State or governing body of an affected Indian tribe determines 
        will cause or contribute to a cumulative change in air quality 
        in excess of that allowed in this subchapter within the 
        affected State or tribal reservation, the Governor or Indian 
        governing body may request the Administrator to enter into 
        negotiations with the parties involved to resolve the dispute.
          (2) Recommendations.--If requested by any State or Indian 
        tribe involved, the Administrator shall make a recommendation 
        to resolve the dispute and protect the air quality related 
        values of the land involved.
          (3) Failure to reach agreement.--If the parties involved do 
        not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve the 
        dispute and the Administrator's determination, or the results 
        of agreements reached through other means, shall become part of 
        the applicable plan and shall be enforceable as part of the 
        plan. In resolving such disputes relating to area 
        redesignation, the Administrator shall consider the extent to 
        which the land involved is of sufficient size to allow 
        effective air quality management or have air quality-related 
        values of such an area.
Sec. 213107. Preconstruction requirements
  (a) Major Emitting Facilities on Which Construction Is Commenced.--No 
major emitting facility may be constructed in any area to which this 
chapter applies unless--
          (1) a permit is issued for the proposed major emitting 
        facility in accordance with this chapter setting forth emission 
        limitations for the major emitting facility that conform to the 
        requirements of this chapter;
          (2)(A) the proposed permit is subjected to a review in 
        accordance with this section;
          (B) the required analysis is conducted in accordance with 
        regulations promulgated by the Administrator; and
          (C) a public hearing is held with opportunity for interested 
        persons including representatives of the Administrator to 
        appear and submit written or oral presentations on--
                          (i) the air quality impact of the source;
                          (ii) alternatives thereto;
                          (iii) control technology requirements; and
                          (iv) other appropriate considerations;
          (3) the owner or operator of the major emitting facility 
        demonstrates, as required pursuant to section 211110(h) of this 
        title, that emissions from construction or operation of the 
        major emitting facility will not cause, or contribute to, air 
        pollution in excess of--
                  (A) any maximum allowable increase or maximum 
                allowable concentration for any pollutant in any area 
                to which this chapter applies more than 1 time per 
                year;
                  (B) any NAAQS in any air quality control region; or
                  (C) any other applicable emission standard or 
                standard of performance under this division;
          (4) the proposed major emitting facility is subject to the 
        best available control technology for each pollutant subject to 
        regulation under this division emitted from, or that results 
        from, the major emitting facility;
          (5) the provisions of subsection (d) with respect to 
        protection of class I areas are complied with for the major 
        emitting facility;
          (6) there is an analysis of any air quality impacts projected 
        for the area as a result of growth associated with the major 
        emitting facility;
          (7) the person that owns or operates, or proposes to own or 
        operate, a major emitting facility for which a permit is 
        required under this chapter agrees to conduct such monitoring 
        as may be necessary to determine the effect that emissions from 
        any such major emitting facility may have, or is having, on air 
        quality in any area that may be affected by emissions from the 
        source; and
          (8) in the case of a source that proposes to construct in a 
        class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute 
        to exceeding the maximum allowable increments applicable in a 
        class II area and where no standard under section 211111 of 
        this title has been promulgated subsequent to August 7, 1977, 
        for that source category, the Administrator has approved the 
        determination of best available technology as set forth in the 
        permit.
  (b) Exception.--The demonstration pertaining to maximum allowable 
increases required under subsection (a)(3) shall not apply to maximum 
allowable increases for class II areas in the case of an expansion or 
modification of a major emitting facility that was in existence on 
August 7, 1977, whose allowable emissions of air pollutants, after 
compliance with subsection (a)(4), will be less than 50 tons per year 
and for which the owner or operator of the major emitting facility 
demonstrates that emissions of particulate matter and sulfur oxides 
will not cause or contribute to ambient air quality levels in excess of 
the secondary NAAQS for particulate matter or sulfur oxides.
  (c) Permit Applications.--Any completed permit application under 
section 211110 of this title for a major emitting facility in any area 
to which this chapter applies shall be granted or denied not later than 
1 year after the date of filing of the completed application.
  (d) Action Taken on Permit Applications; Notice; Adverse Impact on 
Air Quality Related Values; Variance; Emission Limitations.--
          (1) Transmittal of copy of permit application to 
        administrator; notice of action.--Each State shall--
                  (A) transmit to the Administrator a copy of each 
                permit application relating to a major emitting 
                facility received by the State; and
                  (B) provide notice to the Administrator of every 
                action related to the consideration of the permit.
          (2) Federal land manager; federal official charged with 
        responsibility.--
                  (A) Notice.--The Administrator shall provide notice 
                of the permit application to the Federal land manager 
                and the Federal official charged with direct 
                responsibility for management of any land within a 
                class I area that may be affected by emissions from the 
                proposed major emitting facility.
                  (B) Responsibility.--The Federal land manager and the 
                Federal official charged with direct responsibility for 
                management of land within a class I area that may be 
                affected by emissions from the proposed major emitting 
                facility shall have an affirmative responsibility to 
                protect the air quality-related values (including 
                visibility) of any such land within a class I area and 
                to consider, in consultation with the Administrator, 
                whether a proposed major emitting facility will have an 
                adverse impact on those values.
                  (C) Change in air quality; adverse impact on air 
                quality-related values; no adverse impact.--
                          (i) Change in air quality.--In any case where 
                        the Federal official charged with direct 
                        responsibility for management of any land 
                        within a class I area or the Federal land 
                        manager of the land, the Administrator, or the 
                        Governor of an adjacent State containing a 
                        class I area files a notice alleging that 
                        emissions from a proposed major emitting 
                        facility may cause or contribute to a change in 
                        the air quality in the area and identifying the 
                        potential adverse impact of the change, a 
                        permit shall not be issued unless the owner or 
                        operator of the major emitting facility 
                        demonstrates that emissions of particulate 
                        matter and sulfur dioxide will not cause or 
                        contribute to concentrations that exceed the 
                        maximum allowable increases for a class I area.
                          (ii) Adverse impact on the air quality-
                        related values.--In any case where the Federal 
                        land manager demonstrates to the satisfaction 
                        of the State that the emissions from the major 
                        emitting facility will have an adverse impact 
                        on the air quality-related values (including 
                        visibility) of the land, notwithstanding the 
                        fact that the change in air quality resulting 
                        from emissions from the major emitting facility 
                        will not cause or contribute to concentrations 
                        that exceed the maximum allowable increases for 
                        a class I area, a permit shall not be issued.
                          (iii) No adverse impact on air quality-
                        related values.--
                                  (I) In general.--In any case where 
                                the owner or operator of the major 
                                emitting facility demonstrates to the 
                                satisfaction of the Federal land 
                                manager, and the Federal land manager 
                                so certifies, that the emissions from 
                                the major emitting facility will have 
                                no adverse impact on the air quality-
                                related values of the land (including 
                                visibility), notwithstanding the fact 
                                that the change in air quality 
                                resulting from emissions from the major 
                                emitting facility will cause or 
                                contribute to concentrations that 
                                exceed the maximum allowable increases 
                                for class I areas, the State may issue 
                                a permit.
                                  (II) Compliance with emission 
                                limitations.--In the case of a permit 
                                issued pursuant to subclause (I), the 
                                major emitting facility shall comply 
                                with such emission limitations under 
                                the permit as may be necessary to 
                                ensure that emissions of particulate 
                                matter and sulfur oxides from the major 
                                emitting facility will not cause or 
                                contribute to concentrations of 
                                particulate matter or sulfur oxides 
                                that exceed the following maximum 
                                allowable increases over the baseline 
                                concentration for particulate matter 
                                and sulfur oxides:

 
                                                             Maximum
                                                            allowable
                                                           increase (in
                                                          micrograms per
                                                           cubic meter)

                  (D) Variance.--
                          (i) In general.--In any case where the owner 
                        or operator of a proposed major emitting 
                        facility that has been denied a permit under 
                        subparagraph (C)(iii)(I) demonstrates to the 
                        satisfaction of the Governor, after notice and 
                        public hearing, and the Governor finds, that 
                        the facility cannot be constructed by reason of 
                        any maximum allowable increase for sulfur 
                        dioxide for periods of 24 hours or less 
                        applicable to any class I area and, in the case 
                        of Federal mandatory class I areas, that a 
                        variance under this clause will not adversely 
                        affect the air quality related values of the 
                        area (including visibility), the Governor, 
                        after consideration of the Federal land 
                        manager's recommendation (if any) and subject 
                        to the concurrence of the Federal land manager, 
                        may grant a variance from the maximum allowable 
                        increase. If a variance is granted, a permit 
                        may be issued to the source pursuant to the 
                        requirements of this subparagraph.
                          (ii) No concurrence.--In any case in which a 
                        Governor recommends a variance under this 
                        subparagraph in which the Federal land manager 
                        does not concur, the recommendations of the 
                        Governor and the Federal land manager shall be 
                        transmitted to the President. The President may 
                        approve the Governor's recommendation if the 
                        President finds that the variance is in the 
                        national interest. No Presidential finding 
                        shall be reviewable in any court. The variance 
                        shall take effect if the President approves the 
                        Governor's recommendations. The President shall 
                        approve or disapprove the recommendation within 
                        90 days after receipt by the President of the 
                        recommendations of the Governor and the Federal 
                        land manager.

  (e) Analysis.--
          (1) In general.--The review provided for in subsection (a) 
        shall be preceded by an analysis of the ambient air quality at 
        the proposed site and in areas that may be affected by 
        emissions from the major emitting facility for each pollutant 
        subject to regulation under this division that will be emitted 
        from the major emitting facility. The review shall be conducted 
        in accordance with regulations of the Administrator, 
        promulgated under this subsection, and may be conducted by the 
        State, any general purpose unit of local government, or the 
        major emitting facility applying for a permit.
          (2) Continuous air quality monitoring.--The analysis required 
        by this subsection shall include continuous air quality 
        monitoring data gathered for purposes of determining whether 
        emissions from the major emitting facility will exceed the 
        maximum allowable increases or the maximum allowable 
        concentration permitted under this chapter. The data shall be 
        gathered over a period of 1 calendar year preceding the date of 
        application for a permit under this chapter unless the State, 
        in accordance with regulations promulgated by the 
        Administrator, determines that a complete and adequate analysis 
        for such purposes may be accomplished in a shorter period. The 
        results of the analysis shall be available at the time of the 
        public hearing on the application for the permit.
          (3) Regulations.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate

                                of the proposed major emitting facility 
                                and in the area potentially affected by 
                                the emissions from the major emitting 
                                facility for each pollutant regulated 
                                under this division that will be 
                                emitted from, or that results from the 
                                construction or operation of, the major 
                                emitting facility;
                                  (II) the size and nature of the 
                                proposed major emitting facility;
                                  (III) the degree of continuous 
                                emission reduction that could be 
                                achieved by the major emitting 
                                facility; and
                                  (IV) such other factors as may be 
                                relevant in determining the effect of 
                                emissions from a proposed major 
                                emitting facility on any air quality 
                                control region;
                          (iii) shall require that the results of the 
                        analysis be available at the time of the public 
                        hearing on the application for the permit; and
                          (iv) shall specify with reasonable 
                        particularity each air quality model to be used 
                        under specified sets of conditions for purposes 
                        of this chapter.
          (4) Adjustment of models.--Any model or models designated 
        under the regulations may be adjusted based on a determination, 
        after notice and opportunity for public hearing, by the 
        Administrator that an adjustment is necessary to take into 
        account unique terrain or meteorological characteristics of an 
        area potentially affected by emissions from a source applying 
        for a permit required under this chapter.

        State and submitted for the Administrator's approval or 
        promulgated by the Administrator under section 211110(c) of 
        this title contains other provisions that, when considered as a 
        whole, the Administrator finds will carry out the purposes of 
        section 213101 of this title at least as effectively as an area 
        classification plan for that pollutant.
          (2) Maximum allowable increases.--The other provisions 
        described in paragraph (1) need not require the establishment 
        of maximum allowable increases with respect to a pollutant for 
        any area to which this section applies.
  (g) PM-10 Increments.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may substitute, for the 
        maximum allowable increases in particulate matter specified in 
        sections 213105(b) and 213107(d)(2)(C)(iii)(II) of this title,

  (d) Exemptions.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may, by regulation, after 
        notice and opportunity for public hearing, exempt any major 
        stationary source from the requirement of subsection 
        (c)(2)(B)(i), on a determination by the Administrator that the 
        source does not or will not, by itself or in combination with 
        other sources, emit any air pollutant that may reasonably be 
        anticipated to cause or contribute to a significant impairment 
        of visibility in any mandatory class I Federal area.
          (2) Certain fossil fuel-fired powerplants.--Paragraph (1) 
        does not apply to any fossil fuel-fired powerplant with total 
        design capacity of 750 megawatts or more unless the owner or 
        operator of the powerplant demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
        the Administrator that the powerplant is located at such a 
        distance from all mandatory class I Federal areas listed by the 
        Administrator under subsection (b)(2) that the powerplant does 
        not or will not, by itself or in combination with other 
        sources, emit any air pollutant that may reasonably be 
        anticipated to cause or contribute to significant impairment of 
        visibility in any mandatory class I Federal area.
          (3) Concurrence.--An exemption under this subsection shall be 
        effective only on concurrence by the appropriate Federal land 
        manager or Federal land managers with the Administrator's

  (a) Studies.--
          (1) Research.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator, in conjunction 
                with the National Park Service and other appropriate 
                Federal agencies, shall conduct research to identify 
                and evaluate--
                          (i) sources and source regions of visibility 
                        impairment in class I areas; and
                          (ii) regions that provide predominantly clean 
                        air in class I areas.
                  (B) Inclusions.--The research shall include--
                          (i) expansion of current visibility-related 
                        monitoring in class I areas;
                          (ii) assessment of current sources of 
                        visibility-impairing pollution and clean air 
                        corridors;
                          (iii) adaptation of regional air quality 
                        models for the assessment of visibility; and
                          (iv) studies of atmospheric chemistry and 
                        physics of visibility.
          (2) Assessment and evaluation.--Based on the findings 
        available from the research required in paragraph (1), other 
        available scientific and technical data, studies, and other 
        available information pertaining to visibility source-receptor 
        relationships, the Administrator shall conduct an assessment 
        and evaluation that identifies, to the extent possible, sources 
        and source regions of visibility impairment including natural 
        sources and source regions of clear air for class I areas.
  (b) Impacts of Other Provisions.--Every 5 years, the Administrator 
shall conduct an assessment of actual progress and improvement in 
visibility in class I areas. The Administrator shall prepare a written 
report on each assessment and transmit copies of the reports to the 
appropriate committees of Congress.
  (c) Visibility Transport Commissions.--
          (1) Visibility transport regions.--
                  (A) Establishment.--When, on the Administrator's 
                motion or by petition from the Governors of at least 2 
                affected States, the Administrator has reason to 
                believe that the current or projected interstate 
                transport of air pollutants from 1 or more States 
                contributes significantly to visibility impairment in 
                class I areas located in the affected States, the 
                Administrator may establish a visibility transport 
                region for such pollutants that includes those States.
                  (B) Addition and removal of states.--The 
                Administrator, on the Administrator's own motion, on 
                petition from the Governor of any affected State, or on 
                the recommendations of a visibility transport 
                commission established under paragraph (2), may--
                          (i) add any State or portion of a State to a 
                        visibility transport region when the 
                        Administrator determines that the interstate 
                        transport of air pollutants from that State 
                        significantly contributes to visibility 
                        impairment in a class I area located within the 
                        visibility transport region; or
                          (ii) remove any State or portion of a State 
                        from a visibility transport region when the 
                        Administrator has reason to believe that the 
                        control of emissions in that State or portion 
                        of the State pursuant to this section will not 
                        significantly contribute to the protection or 
                        enhancement of visibility in any class I area 
                        in the visibility transport region.
          (2) Visibility transport commissions.--
                  (A) Establishment.--When the Administrator 
                establishes a visibility transport region under 
                paragraph (1), the Administrator shall establish a 
                visibility transport commission comprised of (as a 
                minimum) each of the following members:
                          (i) The Governor of each State in the 
                        visibility transport region, or the Governor's 
                        designee.
                          (ii) The Administrator, or the 
                        Administrator's designee.
                          (iii) A representative of each Federal agency 
                        charged with the direct management of each 
                        class I area within the visibility transport 
                        region.
                  (B) Voting.--Decisions of, and recommendations and 
                requests to the Administrator, by a visibility 
                transport commission may be made only by a majority 
                vote of all members other than the Administrator and 
                the Federal agency representatives (or designees).
                  (C) Federal advisory committee act.--A visibility 
                transport commission shall not be subject to the 
                Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).

  In this chapter:
          (1) Lowest achievable emission rate.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``lowest achievable 
                emission rate'', with respect to a source, means the 
                rate of emissions that reflects the more stringent of--
                          (i) the most stringent emission limitation 
                        that is contained in the implementation plan of 
                        any State for that class or category of source, 
                        unless the owner or operator of the proposed 
                        source demonstrates that such an emission 
                        limitation is not achievable; or
                          (ii) the most stringent emission limitation 
                        that is achieved in practice by that class or 
                        category of source.
                  (B) Effect of application of term.--In no event shall 
                the application of the term ``lowest achievable 
                emission rate'' permit a proposed new or modified 
                source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount 
                allowable under applicable new source standards of 
                performance.
          (2) Modify.--
                  (A) In general.--The term ``modify'', with respect to 
                a stationary source, means to make or undergo any 
                physical change in, or change in the method of 
                operation of, the stationary source that--
                          (i) increases the amount of any air pollutant 
                        emitted by the stationary source; or
                          (ii) results in the emission of any air 
                        pollutant not previously emitted.
                  (B) Conversion to coal.--A conversion to coal by 
                reason of an order under section 2(a) of the Energy 
                Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 (15 
                U.S.C. 792(a)) or any enactment that supersedes that 
                Act shall not be considered to be a modification for 
                purposes of subparagraph (A).
          (3) Nonattainment area.--The term ``nonattainment area'' 
        means, for any air pollutant, an area that is designated 
        nonattainment with respect to that air pollutant within the 
        meaning of section 211107(d) of this title.
          (4) Reasonable further progress.--The term ``reasonable 
        further progress'' means such annual incremental reductions in 
        emissions of an air pollutant as are required by this chapter 
        or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the 
        purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the 
        applicable date.
Sec. 215102. Nonattainment plan provisions in general
  (a) Classifications and Attainment Dates.--
          (1) Classifications.--
                  (A) In general.--On or after the date on which the 
                Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as 
                a nonattainment area pursuant to section 211107(d) of 
                this title with respect to any NAAQS (or any revised 
                standard), the Administrator may classify the area for 
                the purpose of applying an attainment date pursuant to 
                paragraph (2), and for other purposes. In determining 
                the appropriate classification, if any, for a 
                nonattainment area, the Administrator may consider such 
                factors as the severity of nonattainment in the area 
                and the availability and feasibility of the pollution 
                control measures that the Administrator believes may be 
                necessary to provide for attainment of the standard in 
                that area.
                  (B) Procedure.--The Administrator shall publish a 
                notice in the Federal Register announcing each 
                classification under subparagraph (A), except that the 
                Administrator shall provide an opportunity for at least 
                30 days for written comment. A classification shall not 
                be subject to sections 553 to 557 of title 5 and shall 
                not be subject to judicial review until the 
                Administrator takes final action under subsection (i) 
                or (j) of section 211110 or section 215111 of this 
                title with respect to any plan submissions required by 
                virtue of the classification.
                  (C) Nonapplicability.--This paragraph shall not apply 
                with respect to nonattainment areas for which 
                classifications are specifically provided under other 
                provisions of this chapter.
          (2) Attainment dates for nonattainment areas.--
                  (A) Primary naaqses.--The attainment date for an area 
                designated nonattainment with respect to a primary 
                NAAQS shall be the date by which attainment can be 
                achieved as expeditiously as practicable, but not later 
                than 5 years after the date on which the area was 
                designated nonattainment under section 211107(d) of 
                this title, except that the Administrator may extend 
                the attainment date to the extent that the 
                Administrator determines to be appropriate, for a 
                period not longer than 10 years after the date of 
                designation as nonattainment, considering the severity 
                of nonattainment and the availability and feasibility 
                of pollution control measures.
                  (B) Secondary naaqses.--The attainment date for an 
                area designated nonattainment with respect to a 
                secondary NAAQS shall be the date by which attainment 
                can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after 
                the date on which the area was designated nonattainment 
                under section 211107(d) of this title.
                  (C) Extension.--
                          (i) In general.--On application by any State, 
                        the Administrator may extend for 1 additional 
                        year (referred to in this subparagraph as the 
                        ``extension year'') the attainment date 
                        determined by the Administrator under 
                        subparagraph (A) or (B) if--
                                  (I) the State has complied with all 
                                requirements and commitments pertaining 
                                to the area in the applicable 
                                implementation plan; and
                                  (II) in accordance with guidance 
                                published by the Administrator, not 
                                more than a minimal number of 
                                exceedances of the relevant NAAQS has 
                                occurred in the area in the year 
                                preceding the extension year.
                          (ii) Limitation.--Not more than 2 one-year 
                        extensions may be issued under this 
                        subparagraph for a single nonattainment area.
                  (D) Nonapplicability.--This paragraph shall not apply 
                with respect to nonattainment areas for which 
                attainment dates are specifically provided under other 
                provisions of this chapter.
  (b) Schedule for Plan Submissions.--At the time at which the 
Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as nonattainment 
with respect to a NAAQS under section 211107(d) of this title, the 
Administrator shall establish a schedule according to which the State 
containing the area shall submit a plan or plan provision (including 
plan items) meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) and 
section 211110(a)(3) of this title. The schedule shall, at a minimum, 
include a date or dates, extending not later than 3 years after the 
date of the nonattainment designation, for the submission of a plan or 
plan provision (including plan items) meeting the applicable 
requirements of subsection (c) and section 211110(a)(3) of this title.
  (c) Nonattainment Plan Provisions.--
          (1) In general.--The plan provisions (including plan items) 
        shall provide for--
                  (A) implementation of all reasonably available 
                control measures as expeditiously as practicable 
                (including such reductions in emissions from existing 
                sources in the area as may be obtained through the 
                adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control 
                technology); and
                  (B) attainment of the primary NAAQSes.
          (2) Reasonable further progress.--The plan provisions 
        (including plan items) shall require reasonable further 
        progress.
          (3) Inventory.--The plan provisions (including plan items) 
        shall include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of 
        actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutant or 
        pollutants in the area, including such periodic revisions as 
        the Administrator may determine to be necessary to ensure that 
        the requirements of this chapter are met.
          (4) Identification and quantification.--The plan provisions 
        (including plan items) shall expressly identify and quantify 
        the emissions, if any, of any such pollutant or pollutants that 
        will be allowed, in accordance with section 215103(a)(1)(A)(ii) 
        of this title, from the construction and operation of major new 
        or modified stationary sources in each such area. The plan 
        shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that 
        the emissions quantified for this purpose will be consistent 
        with the achievement of reasonable further progress and will 
        not interfere with attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the 
        applicable attainment date.
          (5) Permits for new and modified major stationary sources.--
        The plan provisions (including plan items) shall require 
        permits for the construction and operation of new or modified 
        major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area, in 
        accordance with section 215103 of this title.
          (6) Other measures.--The plan provisions (including plan 
        items) shall include enforceable emission limitations and such 
        other control measures, means, or techniques (including 
        economic incentives such as fees, marketable permits, and 
        auctions of emission rights) and schedules and timetables for 
        compliance as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for 
        attainment of the standard in the area by the applicable 
        attainment date specified in this chapter.
          (7) Compliance with section 211110(a)(3).--The plan 
        provisions (including plan items) shall meet the applicable 
        provisions of section 211110(a)(3) of this title.
          (8) Equivalent techniques.--On application by any State, the 
        Administrator may allow the use of equivalent modeling, 
        emission inventory, and planning procedures, unless the 
        Administrator determines that the proposed techniques are, in 
        the aggregate, less effective than the methods specified by the 
        Administrator.
          (9) Contingency measures.--The plan (including plan items) 
        shall provide for the implementation of specific measures to be 
        undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further 
        progress or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date 
        applicable under this chapter. The measures shall be included 
        in the plan as contingency measures to take effect in any such 
        case without further action by the State or the Administrator.
  (d) Plan Provisions Required in Response to Finding of Plan 
Inadequacy.--
          (1) In general.--Any plan provision for a nonattainment area 
        that is required to be submitted in response to a finding by 
        the Administrator pursuant to section 211110(i)(5) of this 
        title shall--
                  (A) correct the plan deficiency (or deficiencies) 
                specified by the Administrator; and
                  (B) meet all other applicable plan requirements of 
                section 211110 of this title and this chapter.
          (2) Adjustment of dates.--The Administrator may reasonably 
        adjust the dates otherwise applicable under those requirements 
        to the provision (except for attainment dates that have not yet 
        elapsed) to the extent necessary to achieve a consistent 
        application of the requirements.
          (3) Guidelines, interpretations, and information.--
                  (A) In general.--In order to facilitate submittal by 
                the States of adequate and approvable plans consistent 
                with the applicable requirements of this division, the 
                Administrator shall, as appropriate and from time to 
                time, issue written guidelines, interpretations, and 
                information to the States, taking into consideration 
                any such guidelines, interpretations, or information 
                provided before November 15, 1990.
                  (B) Public availability.--Guidelines, 
                interpretations, and information issued under 
                subparagraph (A) shall be available to the public.
  (e) Future Modification of Standard.--If the Administrator relaxes a 
primary NAAQS, the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the 
relaxation, promulgate requirements applicable to all areas that have 
not attained that standard as of the date of the relaxation. The 
requirements shall provide for controls that are not less stringent 
than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before 
the relaxation.
Sec. 215103. Permit requirements
  (a) In General.--
          (1) In general.--The permit program required by section 
        215102(c)(5) of this title shall provide that permits to 
        construct and operate may be issued if--
                  (A) in accordance with regulations issued by the 
                Administrator for the determination of baseline 
                emissions in a manner consistent with the assumptions 
                underlying the applicable implementation plan approved 
                under section 211110 of this title and this chapter, 
                the permitting agency determines that--
                          (i) by the time the source is to commence 
                        operation, sufficient offsetting emissions 
                        reductions have been obtained, such that total 
                        allowable emissions from existing sources in 
                        the region, from new or modified sources that 
                        are not major emitting facilities and from the 
                        proposed source, will be sufficiently less than 
                        total emissions from existing sources (as 
                        determined in accordance with the regulations 
                        under this subparagraph) prior to the 
                        application for the permit to construct or 
                        modify so as to represent (when considered 
                        together with the plan provisions required 
                        under section 215102 of this title) reasonable 
                        further progress; or
                          (ii) in the case of a new or modified major 
                        stationary source that is located in a zone 
                        (within the nonattainment area) identified by 
                        the Administrator, in consultation with the 
                        Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as 
                        a zone to which economic development should be 
                        targeted, that emissions of the pollutant 
                        resulting from the proposed new or modified 
                        major stationary source will not cause or 
                        contribute to emissions levels that exceed the 
                        allowance permitted for the pollutant for the 
                        area from new or modified major stationary 
                        sources under section 215102(c) of this title;
                  (B) the proposed source is required to comply with 
                the lowest achievable emission rate;
                  (C) the owner or operator of the proposed new or 
                modified source has demonstrated that all major 
                stationary sources owned or operated by the owner or 
                operator (or by any entity controlling, controlled by, 
                or under common control with the owner or operator) in 
                the State are subject to emission limitations and are 
                in compliance, or on a schedule for compliance, with 
                all applicable emission limitations and standards under 
                this division;
                  (D) the Administrator has not determined that the 
                applicable implementation plan is not being adequately 
                implemented for the nonattainment area in which the 
                proposed source is to be constructed or modified in 
                accordance with the requirements of this chapter; and
                  (E) an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, 
                production processes, and environmental control 
                techniques for the proposed source demonstrates that 
                benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh 
                the environmental and social costs imposed as a result 
                of its location, construction, or modification.
          (2) Federally enforceable emission reductions.--Any emission 
        reductions required as a precondition of the issuance of a 
        permit under paragraph (1)(A) shall be federally enforceable 
        before a permit may be issued.
  (b) Prohibition of Use of Old Growth Allowances.--Any growth 
allowance included in an applicable implementation plan to meet the 
requirements of section 172(b)(5) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7502(b)(5)) (as in effect on November 14, 1990) shall not be valid for 
use in any area that received a notice under section 110(a)(2)(H)(ii) 
of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H)(ii)) (as in effect on 
November 14, 1990) or under section 211110(i)(1) of this title that its 
applicable implementation plan containing the allowance is 
substantially inadequate.
  (c) Offsets.--
          (1) In general.--The owner or operator of a new or modified 
        major stationary source may comply with any offset requirement 
        in effect under this chapter for increased emissions of any air 
        pollutant only by obtaining emission reductions of the air 
        pollutant from the same source or other sources in the same 
        nonattainment area, except that the State may allow the owner 
        or operator of a source to obtain the emission reductions in 
        another nonattainment area if--
                  (A) the other area has a nonattainment classification 
                that is equal to or higher than that of the area in 
                which the source is located; and
                  (B) emissions from the other area contribute to a 
                violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in 
                which the source is located.
          (2) Emission reduction requirements.--Emission reductions 
        required under paragraph (1)--
                  (A) shall be, by the time a new or modified source 
                commences operation, in effect and enforceable; and
                  (B) shall ensure that the total tonnage of increased 
                emissions of the air pollutant from the new or modified 
                source shall be offset by an equal or greater 
                reduction, as applicable, in the actual emissions of 
                the air pollutant from the same or other sources in the 
                area.
          (3) Creditability.--Emission reductions otherwise required by 
        this division shall not be creditable as emissions reductions 
        for purposes of any such offset requirement. Incidental 
        emission reductions that are not otherwise required by this 
        division shall be creditable as emission reductions for such 
        purposes if the emission reductions meet the requirements of 
        paragraph (1).
  (d) Control Technology Information.--A State shall provide that 
control technology information from permits issued under this section 
will be promptly submitted to the Administrator for purposes of making

other States and to the general public.
  (e) Rocket Engines or Motors.--
          (1) In general.--The permitting authority of a State shall 
        allow a source to offset by alternative or innovative means 
        emission increases from rocket engine and motor firing, and 
        cleaning related to such firing, at an existing or modified 
        major source that tests rocket engines or motors under the 
        following conditions:
                  (A) Purpose.--Any modification proposed is solely for 
                the purpose of expanding the testing of rocket engines 
                or motors at an existing source that was permitted to 
                test such engines on November 15, 1990.
                  (B) Offsets.--The source demonstrates to the 
                satisfaction of the permitting authority of the State 
                that--
                          (i) the source has used all reasonable means 
                        to obtain and utilize offsets, as determined on 
                        an annual basis, for the emissions increases 
                        beyond allowable levels;
                          (ii) all available offsets are being used; 
                        and
                          (iii) sufficient offsets are not available to 
                        the source.
                  (C) National security.--The source has obtained a 
                written finding from the Department of Defense, 
                Department of Transportation, National Aeronautics and 
                Space Administration, or other appropriate Federal 
                agency that the testing of rocket motors or engines at 
                the facility is required for a program essential to 
                national security.
                  (D) Alternative measure.--The source will comply with 
                an alternative measure, imposed by the permitting 
                authority, designed to offset any emission increases 
                beyond permitted levels not directly offset by the 
                source.
          (2) Emission fee.--In lieu of imposing any alternative offset 
        measures, the permitting authority may impose an emission fee 
        to be paid to the permitting authority, which shall be in an 
        amount not greater than 1.5 times the average cost of 
        stationary source control measures adopted in that area during 
        the previous 3 years. The permitting authority shall utilize 
        the fees in a manner that maximizes emission reductions in that 
        area.
Sec. 215104. Planning procedures
  (a) In General.--
          (1) Updated or new planning procedures.--For any ozone, 
        carbon monoxide, or PM-10 nonattainment area, the State 
        containing the area and elected officials of affected local 
        governments shall, before the date required for submittal of 
        the inventory described under section 215203(a)(2) or 
        215303(a)(2) of this title, jointly review and update as

        organization that carried out the functions described in this 
        subsection before November 15, 1990.
  (b) Coordination.--The preparation of implementation plan provisions 
and subsequent plan revisions under the continuing transportation-air 
quality planning process described in section 211108(e) of this title 
shall be coordinated with the continuing, cooperative, and 
comprehensive transportation planning process required under section 
134 of title 23, and those planning processes shall take into account 
the requirements of this chapter.
  (c) Joint Planning.--In the case of a nonattainment area that is 
included within more than 1 State, the affected States may jointly, 
through interstate compact or otherwise, undertake and implement all or 
part of the planning procedures described in this section.
Sec. 215105. EPA grants
  (a) Plan Provision Development Costs.--The Administrator shall make 
grants to any organization of local elected officials with 
transportation or air quality maintenance planning responsibilities 
recognized by a State under section 215104(a) of this title for payment 
of the reasonable costs of developing a plan provision under this 
chapter.
  (b) Grant Funds.--The amount granted to any organization under 
subsection (a) shall be 100 percent of any additional costs of 
developing a plan provision under this chapter for the 1st 2 fiscal 
years following receipt of the grant under this paragraph, and shall 
supplement any funds available under Federal law to the organization 
for transportation or air quality maintenance planning. Grants under 
this section shall not be used for construction.
Sec. 215106. Maintenance plans
  (a) Plan Provision.--A State that submits a request under section 
211107(d) of this title for redesignation of a nonattainment area for 
any air pollutant as an area that has attained the primary NAAQS for 
that air pollutant shall submit an applicable State implementation plan 
provision that--
          (1) provides for the maintenance of the primary NAAQS for 
        that air pollutant in the area for at least 10 years after the 
        redesignation; and
          (2) contains such additional measures, if any, as may be 
        necessary to ensure such maintenance.
  (b) Subsequent Plan Provisions.--Eight years after redesignation of 
any area as an attainment area under section 211107(d) of this title, 
the State shall submit to the Administrator an additional applicable 
State implementation plan provision for maintaining the primary NAAQS 
for 10 years after the expiration of the 10-year period described in 
subsection (a).
  (c) Nonattainment Requirements Applicable Pending Plan Approval.--
Until a plan provision under subsection (b) is approved and an area is 
redesignated as attainment for any area designated as a nonattainment 
area, the requirements of this chapter shall continue in effect with 
respect to the area.
  (d) Contingency Provisions.--A plan provision submitted under this 
section shall contain such contingency provisions as the Administrator 
considers necessary to ensure that the State will promptly correct any 
violation of the standard that occurs after the redesignation of the 
area as an attainment area. The contingency provisions shall include a 
requirement that the State will implement all measures with respect to 
the control of the air pollutant concerned that were contained in the 
State implementation plan for the area before redesignation of the area 
as an attainment area. The failure of any area redesignated as an 
attainment area to maintain the NAAQS concerned shall not result in a 
requirement that the State revise its State implementation plan unless 
the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, requires the 
State to submit a revised State implementation plan.
Sec. 215107. Limitations on certain Federal assistance
  (a) Activities Not Conforming to Approved or Promulgated Plans.--
          (1) Limitation.--
                  (A) In general.--No department, agency, or 
                instrumentality of the Federal Government shall engage 
                in, support in any way or provide financial assistance 
                for, license or permit, or approve any activity that 
                does not conform to an implementation plan after the 
                implementation plan has been approved or promulgated 
                under section 211110 of this title. No metropolitan 
                planning organization designated under section 134 of 
                title 23, shall give its approval to any project, 
                program, or plan that does not conform to an 
                implementation plan approved or promulgated under 
                section 211110 of this title. The assurance of 
                conformity to such an implementation plan shall be an 
                affirmative responsibility of the head of a department, 
                agency, or instrumentality.
                  (B) Conformity.--An activity shall be considered to 
                conform to an implementation plan if the activity--
                          (i) conforms to an implementation plan's 
                        purpose of eliminating or reducing the severity 
                        and number of violations of the NAAQSes and 
                        achieving expeditious attainment of the 
                        NAAQSes; and
                          (ii) will not--
                                  (I) cause or contribute to any new 
                                violation of any NAAQS in any area;
                                  (II) increase the frequency or 
                                severity of any existing violation of 
                                any NAAQS in any area; or
                                  (III) delay timely attainment of any 
                                NAAQS or any required interim emission 
                                reductions or other milestones in any 
                                area.
                  (C) Basis of determination.--The determination of 
                conformity shall be based on the most recent estimates 
                of emissions, and those estimates shall be determined 
                from the most recent population, employment, travel, 
                and congestion estimates as determined by the 
                metropolitan planning organization or other agency 
                authorized to make such estimates.
          (2) Transportation plans and programs.--
                  (A) In general.--Any transportation plan or program 
                developed pursuant to title 23 or chapter 53 of title 
                49 shall implement the transportation provisions of any 
                applicable implementation plan approved under this 
                division applicable to all or part of the area covered 
                by the transportation plan or program. No Federal 
                agency may approve, accept, or fund any transportation 
                plan, program, or project unless the plan, program, or 
                project has been found to conform to any applicable 
                implementation plan in effect under this division.
                  (B) Particular cases.--In particular--
                          (i) no transportation plan or transportation 
                        improvement program may be adopted by a 
                        metropolitan planning organization designated 
                        under title 23 or chapter 53 of title 49, or be 
                        found to be in conformity by a metropolitan 
                        planning organization, until a final 
                        determination has been made that--
                                  (I) emissions expected from 
                                implementation of the plans and 
                                programs are consistent with estimates 
                                of emissions from motor vehicles and 
                                necessary emissions reductions 
                                contained in the applicable 
                                implementation plan; and
                                  (II) the plan or program will conform 
                                to the requirements of paragraph 
                                (1)(B)(ii);
                          (ii) no metropolitan planning organization or 
                        other recipient of funds under title 23 or 
                        chapter 53 of title 49 shall adopt or approve a 
                        transportation improvement program of projects 
                        until the recipient of funds determines that 
                        the program provides for timely implementation 
                        of transportation control measures consistent 
                        with schedules included in the applicable 
                        implementation plan; and
                          (iii) a transportation project may be adopted 
                        or approved by a metropolitan planning 
                        organization or any recipient of funds 
                        designated under title 23 or chapter 53 of 
                        title 49, or found in conformity by a 
                        metropolitan planning organization or approved, 
                        accepted, or funded by the Department of 
                        Transportation only if--
                                  (I) the transportation project meets 
                                the requirements of subparagraph (C); 
                                or
                                  (II)(aa) the transportation project 
                                comes from a conforming plan and 
                                program;
                                  (bb) the design concept and scope of 
                                the transportation project have not 
                                changed significantly since the 
                                conformity finding regarding the plan 
                                and program from which the project 
                                derived; and
                                  (cc) the design concept and scope of 
                                the transportation project at the time 
                                of the conformity determination for the 
                                program was adequate to determine 
                                emissions.
                  (C) Treatment of certain projects as conforming.--Any 
                project not described in subparagraph (B)(iii) shall be 
                treated as conforming to the applicable implementation 
                plan only if it is demonstrated that the projected 
                emissions from the project, when considered together 
                with emissions projected for the conforming 
                transportation plans and programs within the 
                nonattainment area, do not cause those plans and 
                programs to exceed the emission reduction projections 
                and schedules assigned to the plans and programs in the 
                applicable implementation plan.
                  (D) Redetermination of conformity.--The appropriate 
                metropolitan planning organization shall redetermine 
                conformity of existing transportation plans and 
                programs not later than 2 years after the date on which 
                the Administrator--
                          (i) finds a motor vehicle emissions budget to 
                        be adequate in accordance with section 
                        93.118(e)(4) of title 40, Code of Federal 
                        Regulations (as in effect on October 1, 2004);
                          (ii) approves an implementation plan that 
                        establishes a motor vehicle emissions budget if 
                        that budget has not yet been determined to be 
                        adequate in accordance with clause (i); or
                          (iii) promulgates an implementation plan that 
                        establishes or revises a motor vehicle 
                        emissions budget.
          (3) Demonstration of conformity.--
                  (A) In general.--Until such time as the 
                implementation plan provision described in paragraph 
                (4)(E) is approved, conformity of plans, programs, and 
                projects described in this paragraph will be 
                demonstrated if--
                          (i) the transportation plans and programs--
                                  (I) are consistent with the most 
                                recent estimates of mobile source 
                                emissions;
                                  (II) provide for the expeditious 
                                implementation of transportation 
                                control measures in the applicable 
                                implementation plan; and
                                  (III) with respect to ozone and 
                                carbon monoxide nonattainment areas, 
                                contribute to annual emissions 
                                reductions consistent with sections

                                title; and
                          (ii) the transportation projects--
                                  (I) come from a conforming 
                                transportation plan and program as 
                                defined in clause (i); and
                                  (II) in carbon monoxide nonattainment 
                                areas, eliminate or reduce the severity 
                                and number of violations of the carbon 
                                monoxide standards in the area 
                                substantially affected by the project.
                  (B) Determination for transportation program or 
                individual project.--With regard to subparagraph 
                (A)(ii)(II), the determination may be made as part of 
                the conformity determination for the transportation 
                program or for the individual project taken as a whole 
                during the environmental review phase of project 
                development.

                        on updated transportation plans and programs 
                        shall be every 4 years, except in a case in 
                        which--
                                  (I) the metropolitan planning 
                                organization elects to update a 
                                transportation plan or program more 
                                frequently; or
                                  (II) the metropolitan planning 
                                organization is required to determine 
                                conformity in accordance with paragraph 
                                (2)(D); and

                procedures under subparagraph (A) shall include a 
                requirement that each State include in the State 
                implementation plan criteria and procedures for 
                consultation required by subparagraph (D)(i), and 
                enforcement and enforceability (pursuant to sections 
                93.125(c) and 93.122(a)(4)(ii) of title 40, Code of 
                Federal Regulations) in accordance with the 
                Administrator's criteria and procedures for 
                consultation, enforcement, and enforceability.
                  (F) Traffic signal synchronization projects.--
                Compliance with the regulations of the Administrator 
                for determining the conformity of transportation plans, 
                programs, and projects funded or approved under title 
                23 or chapter 53 of title 49 to State or Federal 
                implementation plans shall not be required for traffic 
                signal synchronization projects prior to the funding, 
                approval or implementation of such projects. The 
                supporting regional emissions analysis for any 
                conformity determination made with respect to a 
                transportation plan, program, or project shall consider 
                the effect on emissions of any such project funded, 
                approved, or implemented prior to the conformity 
                determination.
          (5) Applicability.--This subsection shall apply only with 
        respect to--
                  (A) a nonattainment area and each pollutant for which 
                the area is designated as a nonattainment area; and
                  (B) an area that was designated as a nonattainment 
                area but that was later redesignated by the 
                Administrator as an attainment area and that is 
                required to develop a maintenance plan under section 
                215106 of this title with respect to the specific 
                pollutant for which the area was designated 
                nonattainment.
          (6) Nonapplicability.--Notwithstanding paragraph (5), this 
        subsection shall not apply with respect to an area designated 
        nonattainment under section 211107(d)(1) of this title until 1 
        year after the area is first designated nonattainment for a 
        specific NAAQS. This paragraph applies only with respect to the 
        NAAQS for which an area is newly designated nonattainment and 
        does not affect the area's requirements with respect to all 
        other NAAQSes for which the area is designated nonattainment or 
        has been redesignated from nonattainment to attainment with a 
        maintenance plan pursuant to section 215106 of this title 
        (including any pre-existing NAAQS for a pollutant for which a 
        new or revised standard has been issued).
          (7) Conformity horizon for transportation plans.--
                  (A) Definition of air pollution control agency.--In 
                this paragraph, the term ``air pollution control 
                agency'' means an air pollution control agency (as 
                defined in section 201101 of this title) that is 
                responsible for developing plans or controlling air 
                pollution within the area covered by a transportation 
                plan.
                  (B) In general.--Each conformity determination 
                required under this section for a transportation plan 
                under section 134(i) of title 23 or section 5303(i) of 
                title 49 shall require a demonstration of conformity 
                for--
                          (i) the period ending on the final year of 
                        the transportation plan; or
                          (ii) at the election of the metropolitan 
                        planning organization, after consultation with 
                        the air pollution control agency and 
                        solicitation of public comments and 
                        consideration of the comments, the longest of 
                        the following periods:
                                  (I) The 1st 10-year period of the 
                                transportation plan.
                                  (II) The period ending on the latest 
                                year in the implementation plan 
                                applicable to the area that contains a 
                                motor vehicle emission budget.
                                  (III) The period ending on the year 
                                after the completion date of a 
                                regionally significant project if the 
                                project is included in the 
                                transportation improvement program or 
                                the project requires approval before 
                                the subsequent conformity 
                                determination.
                  (C) Regional emissions analysis.--The conformity 
                determination shall be accompanied by a regional 
                emissions analysis for the last year of the 
                transportation plan and for any year shown to exceed 
                emission budgets by a prior analysis, if that year 
                extends beyond the applicable period as determined 
                under subparagraph (B).
                  (D) Exception.--In any case in which an area has an 
                implementation plan provision under section 215106(b) 
                of this title and the Administrator finds the motor 
                vehicles emissions budgets from that revision to be 
                adequate in accordance with section 93.118(e)(4) of 
                title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on 
                October 1, 2004), or approves the provision, the 
                demonstration of conformity, at the election of the 
                metropolitan planning organization, after consultation 
                with the air pollution control agency and solicitation 
                of public comments and consideration of such comments, 
                shall be required to extend only through the last year 
                of the implementation plan required under section 
                215106(b) of this title.
                  (E) Effect of election.--Any election by a 
                metropolitan planning organization under this paragraph 
                shall continue in effect until the metropolitan 
                planning organization elects otherwise.
          (8) Substitution of transportation control measures.--
                  (A) In general.--Transportation control measures that 
                are specified in an implementation plan may be replaced 
                or added to the implementation plan with alternate or 
                additional transportation control measures if--
                          (i) the substitute measures achieve 
                        equivalent or greater emissions reductions than 
                        the control measure to be replaced, as 
                        demonstrated with an emissions impact analysis 
                        that is consistent with the current methodology 
                        used for evaluating the replaced control 
                        measure in the implementation plan;
                          (ii) the substitute control measures are 
                        implemented--
                                  (I) in accordance with a schedule 
                                that is consistent with the schedule 
                                provided for control measures in the 
                                implementation plan; or
                                  (II) if the implementation plan date 
                                for implementation of the control 
                                measure to be replaced has passed, as 
                                soon as practicable after the 
                                implementation plan date but not later 
                                than the date on which emission 
                                reductions are necessary to achieve the 
                                purpose of the implementation plan;
                          (iii) the substitute and additional control 
                        measures are accompanied by evidence of 
                        adequate personnel and funding and authority 
                        under State or local law to implement, monitor, 
                        and enforce the control measures;
                          (iv) the substitute and additional control 
                        measures are developed through a collaborative 
                        process that includes--
                                  (I) participation by representatives 
                                of all affected jurisdictions 
                                (including local air pollution control 
                                agencies, the State air pollution 
                                control agency, and State and local 
                                transportation agencies);
                                  (II) consultation with the 
                                Administrator; and
                                  (III) reasonable public notice and 
                                opportunity for comment; and
                          (v) the metropolitan planning organization, 
                        the State air pollution control agency, and the 
                        Administrator concur with the equivalency of 
                        the substitute or additional control measures.
                  (B) Adoption.--
                          (i) Effect of concurrence.--Concurrence by 
                        the metropolitan planning organization, the 
                        State air pollution control agency, and the 
                        Administrator as required by subparagraph 
                        (A)(v) shall constitute adoption of the 
                        substitute or additional control measures so 
                        long as the requirements of clauses (i), (ii), 
                        (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A) are met.
                          (ii) State implementation plan; federal 
                        enforceability.--Once adopted, the substitute 
                        or additional control measures become, by 
                        operation of law, part of the State 
                        implementation plan and become federally 
                        enforceable.
                          (iii) Submittal.--Within 90 days of its 
                        concurrence under subparagraph (A)(v), the 
                        State air pollution control agency shall submit 
                        the substitute or additional control measure to 
                        the Administrator for incorporation in the 
                        codification of the applicable implementation 
                        plan.
                          (iv) No additional process.--Notwithstanding 
                        any other provision of this division, no 
                        additional State process shall be necessary to 
                        support such an applicable plan provision.
                  (C) No requirement for express permission.--The 
                substitution or addition of a transportation control 
                measure in accordance with this paragraph and the 
                funding or approval of such a control measure shall not 
                be contingent on the existence of any provision in the 
                applicable implementation plan that expressly permits 
                such a substitution or addition.
                  (D) No requirement for new conformity 
                determination.--The substitution or addition of a 
                transportation control measure in accordance with this 
                paragraph shall not require--
                          (i) a new conformity determination for the 
                        transportation plan; or
                          (ii) a revision of the implementation plan.
                  (E) Continuation of control measure being replaced.--
                A control measure that is being replaced by a 
                substitute control measure under this paragraph shall 
                remain in effect until the substitute control measure 
                is adopted by the State pursuant to subparagraph (B).
                  (F) Effect of adoption.--Adoption of a substitute 
                control measure shall constitute rescission of the 
                previously applicable control measure.
          (9) Lapse of conformity.--
                  (A) In general.--A transportation plan shall lapse 
                if--
                          (i) a conformity determination required under 
                        this subsection for a transportation plan under 
                        section 134(i) of title 23 or section 5303(i) 
                        of title 49, or a transportation improvement 
                        program under section 134(j) of title 23 or 
                        under section 5303(j) of title 49 is not made 
                        by the applicable deadline; and
                          (ii) the failure to make a conformity 
                        determination is not corrected by--
                                  (I) additional measures to reduce 
                                motor vehicle emissions sufficient to 
                                demonstrate compliance with the 
                                requirements of this subsection within 
                                12 months after the deadline; or
                                  (II) other measures sufficient to 
                                correct the failures.
                  (B) Effect of lapse.--If a transportation plan lapses 
                under subparagraph (A)--
                          (i) the conformity determination for the 
                        transportation plan or transportation 
                        improvement program expires; and
                          (ii) there is no currently conforming 
                        transportation plan or transportation 
                        improvement program.
  (b) Priority of Achieving and Maintaining Primary NAAQSes.--Each 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government having 
authority to conduct or support any program with air quality-related 
transportation consequences shall give priority in the exercise of that 
authority, consistent with statutory requirements for allocation among 
States or other jurisdictions, to the implementation of the portions of 
plans prepared under this section to achieve and maintain the primary 
NAAQS. The authority to which this subsection extends includes 
authority exercised under chapter 53 of title 49, title 23, the Housing 
and Urban Development Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 451), the Housing and Urban 
Development Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 476), the Housing and Urban 
Development Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 379), and the Housing and Urban 
Development Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1770).
Sec. 215108. Interstate transport commissions
  (a) Interstate Transport Regions.--
          (1) Establishment.--When, on the Administrator's own motion 
        or by petition from the Governor of any State, the 
        Administrator has reason to believe that the interstate 
        transport of air pollutants from 1 or more States contributes 
        significantly to a violation of a NAAQS in 1 or more other 
        States, the Administrator may establish, by regulation, an 
        interstate transport region for the pollutant that includes 
        those States.
          (2) Addition and removal of states.--The Administrator, on 
        the Administrator's own motion, on petition from the Governor 
        of any State, or on the recommendation of an interstate 
        transport commission established under subsection (b), may--
                  (A) add any State or portion of a State to an 
                interstate transport region established under this 
                subsection when the Administrator has reason to believe 
                that the interstate transport of air pollutants from 
                that State significantly contributes to a violation of 
                the NAAQS in the interstate transport region; or
                  (B) remove any State or portion of a State from an 
                interstate transport region when the Administrator has 
                reason to believe that the control of emissions in that 
                State or portion of the State pursuant to this section 
                will not significantly contribute to the attainment of 
                the NAAQS in any area in the interstate transport 
                region.
          (3) Procedure.--
                  (A) Approval or disapproval.--The Administrator shall 
                approve or disapprove a petition or recommendation 
                under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) within 
                18 months after its receipt.
                  (B) Public participation.--The Administrator shall 
                establish appropriate proceedings for public 
                participation regarding motions, petitions, and 
                recommendations under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
                paragraph (2), including notice and comment.
  (b) Interstate Transport Commissions.--
          (1) Establishment.--When the Administrator establishes an 
        interstate transport region under subsection (a), the 
        Administrator shall establish a transport commission comprised 
        of (at a minimum) each of the following members:
                  (A) The Governor of each State in the interstate 
                transport region or the Governor's designee.
                  (B) The Administrator, or the Administrator's 
                designee.
                  (C) The Regional Administrator (or the 
                Administrator's designee) for each Regional Office for 
                each EPA region affected by the interstate transport 
                region.
                  (D) An air pollution control official representing 
                each State in the interstate transport region, 
                appointed by the Governor.
          (2) Voting.--Decisions of, and recommendations and requests 
        to the Administrator, by an interstate transport commission may 
        be made only by a majority vote of all members other than the 
        Administrator and the Regional Administrators (or designees).
          (3) Recommendations.--An interstate transport commission 
        shall--
                  (A) assess the degree of interstate transport of the 
                pollutant or precursors to the pollutant throughout the 
                interstate transport region;
                  (B) assess strategies for mitigating the interstate 
                pollution; and
                  (C) recommend to the Administrator such measures as 
                the interstate transport commission determines to be 
                necessary to ensure that the implementation plans for 
                the States in the interstate transport region meet the 
                requirements of section 211110(a)(3)(D) of this title.
          (4) Federal advisory committee act.--An interstate transport 
        commission shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory 
        Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).
  (c) Commission Requests.--
          (1) Request.--An interstate transport commission may request 
        the Administrator to issue a finding under section 211110(i)(5) 
        of this title that the implementation plan for 1 or more of the 
        States in the interstate transport region is substantially 
        inadequate to meet the requirements of section 211110(a)(3)(D) 
        of this title.
          (2) Public participation; specific recommendations.--In 
        acting on a request under paragraph (1), the Administrator 
        shall provide an opportunity for public participation and shall 
        address each specific recommendation made by the commission.
          (3) Approval or disapproval.--The Administrator shall 
        approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially 
        disapprove a request under paragraph (1) within 18 months after 
        its receipt and, to the extent that the Administrator approves 
        the request, issue the finding under section 211110(i)(5) of 
        this title at the time of approval. Approval or disapproval of 
        a request shall constitute final agency action within the 
        meaning of section 203102(b) of this title.
Sec. 215109. New motor vehicle emission standards in nonattainment 
                    areas
  (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 221109(a) of this title, any 
State that has implementation plan provisions approved under this 
chapter may adopt and enforce for any model year standards relating to 
control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines and take such other actions as are described in section 
221109(a) of this title respecting such vehicles if--
          (1) the standards are identical to the California standards 
        for which a waiver has been granted for that model year; and
          (2) California and that State adopt the standards at least 2 
        years before commencement of the model year (as determined by 
        regulations of the Administrator).
  (b) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section or in subdivision 3 
shall be construed as authorizing any State described in subsection (a) 
to--
          (1) prohibit or limit, directly or indirectly, the 
        manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
        engine that is certified in California as meeting California 
        standards; or
          (2) take any action to create, or have the effect of 
        creating, a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine different 
        from a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under 
        California standards (referred to in this section as a ``3d 
        vehicle'') or otherwise create a 3d vehicle.
Sec. 215110. Guidance documents respecting the lowest achievable 
                    emission rate
  (a) In General.--The Administrator shall issue guidance documents 
under section 211108 of this title for purposes of assisting States in 
implementing requirements of this chapter respecting the lowest 
achievable emission rate.
  (b) Revision.--The guidance documents shall be revised at least every 
2 years.
Sec. 215111. Sanctions and consequences of failure to attain
  (a) State Failure.--
          (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for any 
        implementation plan or plan revision required under this 
        chapter (or required in response to a finding of substantial 
        inadequacy as described in section 211110(i)(5) of this title), 
        if the Administrator--
                  (A) finds that a State has failed, for an area 
                designated nonattainment under section 211107(d) of 
                this title, to submit a plan, or to submit 1 or more of 
                the elements (as determined by the Administrator) 
                required by the provisions of this division applicable 
                to such an area, or has failed to make a submission for 
                such an area that satisfies the minimum criteria 
                established in relation to any such element under 
                section 211110(i) of this title;
                  (B) disapproves a submission under section 211110(i) 
                of this title for an area designated nonattainment 
                under section 211107 of this title, based on the 
                submission's failure to meet 1 or more of the elements 
                required by the provisions of this division applicable 
                to such an area;
                  (C)(i) determines that a State has failed to make any 
                submission as required under this division (other than 
                a submission described under subparagraph (A) or (B)), 
                including an adequate maintenance plan that satisfies 
                the minimum criteria established in relation to the 
                submission under section 211110(i)(1)(A) of this title; 
                or
                  (ii) disapproves in whole or in part a submission 
                under section 211110(i)(1)(A) of this title; or
                  (D) finds that any requirement of an approved plan 
                (or approved part of a plan) is not being implemented;
        unless the deficiency is corrected within 18 months after the 
        finding, disapproval, or determination under subparagraph (A), 
        (B), (C), or (D), 1 of the sanctions described in subsection 
        (b) shall apply, as selected by the Administrator, until the 
        Administrator determines that the State has come into 
        compliance.
          (2) Lack of good faith.--If the Administrator finds a lack of 
        good faith, sanctions under both paragraphs (2) and (3) of 
        subsection (b) shall apply until the Administrator determines 
        that the State has come into compliance.
          (3) Deficiency not corrected within 6 months.--If the 
        Administrator has selected 1 of the sanctions under subsection 
        (b) and the deficiency is not corrected within 6 months 
        thereafter, sanctions under both paragraphs (2) and (3) of 
        subsection (b) shall apply until the Administrator determines 
        that the State has come into compliance.
          (4) Withholding of grant.--In addition to any other sanction 
        applicable as provided in this section, the Administrator may 
        withhold all or part of a grant for support of air pollution 
        planning and control programs that the Administrator may award 
        under section 211105 of this title.
  (b) Sanctions.--
          (1) In general.--The sanctions available to the Administrator 
        under subsection (a) are as provided in this subsection.
          (2) Highway sanctions.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator may impose a 
                prohibition, applicable to a nonattainment area, on the 
                approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any 
                projects or the awarding by the Secretary of any grants 
                under title 23, other than a project or grant for--
                          (i) safety, if the Secretary determines, 
                        based on accident or other appropriate data 
                        submitted by the State, that the principal 
                        purpose of the project is an improvement in 
                        safety to resolve a demonstrated safety problem 
                        and likely will result in a significant 
                        reduction in, or avoidance of, accidents;
                          (ii) capital programs for public transit;
                          (iii) construction or restriction of certain 
                        roads or lanes solely for the use of passenger 
                        buses or high occupancy vehicles;
                          (iv) planning for requirements for employers 
                        to reduce employee work-trip-related vehicle 
                        emissions;
                          (v) highway ramp metering, traffic 
                        signalization, and related programs that 
                        improve traffic flow and achieve a net emission 
                        reduction;
                          (vi) fringe and transportation corridor 
                        parking facilities serving multiple occupancy 
                        vehicle programs or transit operations;
                          (vii) programs to limit or restrict vehicle 
                        use in downtown areas or other areas of 
                        emission concentration particularly during 
                        periods of peak use, through road use charges, 
                        tolls, parking surcharges, or other pricing 
                        mechanisms, vehicle restricted zones or 
                        periods, or vehicle registration programs;
                          (viii) programs for breakdown and accident 
                        scene management, nonrecurring congestion, and 
                        vehicle information systems, to reduce 
                        congestion and emissions; and
                          (ix) such other transportation-related 
                        programs as the Administrator, in consultation 
                        with the Secretary of Transportation, finds 
                        would improve air quality and would not 
                        encourage single occupancy vehicle capacity.
                  (B) Considerations.--In considering measures 
                described in clauses (ii) through (ix) of subparagraph 
                (A), a State should seek to ensure adequate access to 
                downtown, other commercial, and residential areas and 
                avoid increasing or relocating emissions and 
                congestion.
                  (C) Effective date.--A prohibition under subparagraph 
                (A) shall become effective on the selection by the 
                Administrator of the sanction.
          (3) Offsets.--In applying the emissions offset requirements 
        of section 215103 of this title to new or modified sources or 
        emissions units for which a permit is required under this 
        chapter, the ratio of emission reductions to increased 
        emissions shall be at least 2 to 1.
  (c) Notice of Failure To Attain.--
          (1) Determination.--As expeditiously as practicable after the 
        applicable attainment date for any nonattainment area, but not 
        later than 6 months after that date, the Administrator shall 
        determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment 
        date, whether the area attained the standard by that date.
          (2) Notice.--On making a determination under paragraph (1), 
        the Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal 
        Register containing the determination and identifying each area 
        that the Administrator determined to have failed to attain.
          (3) Revision or supplementation.--The Administrator may 
        revise or supplement a determination under paragraph (1) at any 
        time based on more complete information or analysis concerning 
        the area's air quality as of the attainment date.
  (d) Consequences for Failure To Attain.--
          (1) Revision of implementation plan.--Within 1 year after the 
        Administrator publishes a notice under subsection (c)(2), each 
        State containing a nonattainment area shall submit a revision 
        to the applicable implementation plan meeting the requirements 
        of paragraph (2).
          (2) Requirements.--A revision required under paragraph (1) 
        shall--
                  (A) meet the requirements of sections 211110 and 
                215102 of this title; and
                  (B) include such additional measures as the 
                Administrator may reasonably prescribe, including all 
                measures that can be feasibly implemented in the area 
                in light of technological achievability, costs, and 
                other air quality-related and non-air-quality-related 
                health and environmental impacts.
          (3) Attainment date.--The attainment date applicable to a 
        revision required under paragraph (1) shall be the same as 
        provided in paragraph (2) of section 215102(a) of this title, 
        except that in applying subparagraph (A) of that paragraph the 
        phrase ``after the date of the notice under section 
        215111(c)(2) of this title'' shall be substituted for the 
        phrase ``after the date on which the area was designated 
        nonattainment under section 211107(d) of this title'' and for

Sec. 215202. Classifications and attainment dates
  (a) Classification and Attainment Dates for 1989 Nonattainment 
Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each area designated nonattainment for ozone 
        pursuant to section 211107(d) of this title shall be classified 
        at the time of designation, under table 1, by operation of law, 
        as a marginal area, moderate area, serious area, severe area,

        design value shall be calculated according to the 
        interpretation methodology issued by the Administrator most 
        recently before November 15, 1990. For each area classified 
        under this subsection, the primary standard attainment date for 
        ozone shall be achieved as expeditiously as practicable but not 
        later than the date provided in table 1.

                                                     TABLE 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Area class                          Design value*            Primary standard  attainment date**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marginal...............................  0.121 up to 0.138...............  3 years after November 15, 1990
Moderate...............................  0.138 up to 0.160...............  6 years after November 15, 1990

Severe.................................  0.180 up to 0.280...............  15 years after November 15, 1990
Extreme................................  0.280 and above.................  20 years after November 15, 1990
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*The design value is measured in parts per million (ppm).
**The primary standard attainment date is measured from November 15, 1990.

          (2) Certain severe areas.--Notwithstanding table 1, in the 
        case of a severe area with a 1988 ozone design value between 
        0.190 and 0.280 part per million, the attainment date shall be 
        17 years (in lieu of 15 years) after November 15, 1990.
          (3) Notice.--At the time of publication of the notice under 
        section 211107(d)(4) of this title for each ozone nonattainment 
        area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the 
        classification of the ozone nonattainment area. Section 
        215102(a)(1)(B) of this title shall apply to such a 
        classification.
          (4) Adjustment.--
                  (A) In general.--If an area classified under 
                paragraph (1) would have been classified in another 
                category if the design value in the area were 5 percent 
                greater or 5 percent less than the level on which the 
                classification was based, the Administrator may, within 
                90 days after the initial classification, by the 
                procedure required under paragraph (3), adjust the 
                classification to place the area in the other category.
                  (B) Considerations.--In making an adjustment under 
                subparagraph (A), the Administrator may consider--
                          (i) the number of exceedances of the primary 
                        NAAQS for ozone in the area;
                          (ii) the level of pollution transport between 
                        the area and other affected areas, including 
                        both intrastate and interstate transport; and
                          (iii) the mix of sources and air pollutants 
                        in the area.
          (5) Extension.--
                  (A) In general.--On application by any State, the 
                Administrator may extend for 1 additional year 
                (referred to in this paragraph as an ``extension 
                year'') the date specified in table 1 if--
                          (i) the State has complied with all 
                        requirements and commitments pertaining to the 
                        area in the applicable implementation plan; and
                          (ii) not more than 1 exceedance of the NAAQS 
                        level for ozone has occurred in the area in the 
                        year preceding the extension year.
                  (B) Limitation.--Not more than 2 one-year extensions 
                may be issued under this paragraph for a single 
                nonattainment area.
  (b) New Designations and Reclassifications.--
          (1) New designations to nonattainment.--Any area that is 
        designated attainment or unclassifiable for ozone under section 
        211107(d)(4) of this title and is subsequently redesignated to 
        nonattainment for ozone under section 211107(d)(3) of this 
        title shall, at the time of redesignation, be classified by 
        operation of law in accordance with table 1. Upon its 
        classification, the area shall be subject to the same 
        requirements under section 211110 of this title, subchapter I, 
        and this subchapter that would have applied had the area been 
        so classified at the time of the notice under subsection 
        (a)(3), except that any absolute, fixed date applicable in 
        connection with any such requirement is extended by operation 
        of law by a period equal to the length of time between November 
        15, 1990, and the date on which the area is classified under 
        this paragraph.
          (2) Reclassification on failure to attain.--
                  (A) Determination.--Within 6 months following the 
                applicable attainment date (including any extension) 
                for an ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator 
                shall determine, based on the area's design value (as 
                of the attainment date), whether the area attained the 
                NAAQS by that date.
                  (B) Reclassification.--Except for any severe area or 
                extreme area, any area that the Administrator finds has 
                not attained the NAAQS by that date shall be 
                reclassified by operation of law in accordance with 
                table 1 to the higher of--
                          (i) the next higher classification for the 
                        area; or
                          (ii) the classification applicable to the 
                        area's design value as determined at the time 
                        of the notice required under subparagraph (D).
                  (C) No reclassification as extreme area.--No area 
                shall be reclassified as an extreme area under 
                subparagraph (B)(ii).
                  (D) Notice.--The Administrator shall publish a notice 
                in the Federal Register, not later than 6 months 
                following the attainment date, identifying each area 
                that the Administrator has determined under 
                subparagraph (A) as having failed to attain and 
                identifying the reclassification, if any, described 
                under subparagraph (B).
          (3) Voluntary reclassification.--The Administrator shall 
        grant the request of any State to reclassify a nonattainment 
        area in that State in accordance with table 1 to a higher 
        classification. The Administrator shall publish a notice in the 
        Federal Register of any such request and of action by the 
        Administrator granting the request.
          (4) Failure of severe area to attain standard.--
                  (A) In general.--
                          (i) Sanctions.--If any severe area fails to 
                        achieve the primary NAAQS for ozone by the 
                        applicable attainment date (including any 
                        extension)--
                                  (I) the fee provisions under section 
                                215206 of this title shall apply within 
                                the severe area; and
                                  (II)(aa) the percent reduction 
                                requirements of section 215203(c)(4)(C) 
                                of this title shall continue to apply 
                                to the severe area; and
                                  (bb) the State shall demonstrate that 
                                the required percent reduction has been 
                                achieved in each 3-year interval after 
                                such failure until the standard is 
                                attained.
                          (ii) Failure to make demonstration.--Any 
                        failure to make a demonstration under clause 
                        (i)(II)(bb) shall be subject to the sanctions 
                        provided under this chapter.
                  (B) Design value above 0.140 part per million or 
                failure to achieve milestone.--In addition to the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A), if the ozone design 
                value for a severe area described in subparagraph (A) 
                is above 0.140 part per million for the year of the 
                applicable attainment date, or if the severe area has 
                failed to achieve its most recent milestone under 
                section 215203(g) of this title, the new source review 
                requirements applicable under this subchapter in 
                extreme areas shall apply in the severe area, for which 
                purpose the terms ``major source'' and ``major 
                stationary source'' as applied to the severe area shall 
                have the same meaning as when applied to extreme areas.
                  (C) Additional requirements.--In addition to the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A), in the case of an 
                area described in subparagraph (A) and not described in 
                subparagraph (B), the provisions described in 
                subparagraph (B) shall apply beginning 3 years after 
                the applicable attainment date unless the area has 
                attained the standard by the end of that 3-year period.
                  (D) Modification of method of determining 
                compliance.--If the Administrator modifies the method 
                of determining compliance with the primary NAAQS, a 
                design value or other indicator comparable to 0.140 
                part per million in terms of its relationship to the 
                standard shall be used in lieu of 0.140 part per 
                million for purposes of applying subparagraphs (B) and 
                (C).
Sec. 215203. Plan provisions
  (a) Marginal Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of a 
        marginal area is located shall, with respect to the marginal 
        area (or portion thereof, to the extent specified in this 
        subsection), include in its applicable implementation plan the 
        provisions (including the plan items) described under this 
        subsection.
          (2) Inventory.--A State shall submit a comprehensive, 
        accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all

                                        ensuring that any retesting of 
                                        a vehicle after a failure shall 
                                        include proof of corrective 
                                        action and providing for denial 
                                        of vehicle registration in the

                                which shall be incorporated in the 
                                applicable State implementation plans 
                                by the States, shall provide a State 
                                with continued reasonable flexibility 
                                to fashion effective, reasonable, and 
                                fair programs for the affected 
                                consumer.
                                  (IV) Submission of revision.--Not 
                                later than 2 years after the 
                                Administrator promulgates regulations 
                                under section 221102(l)(3) of this 
                                title, a State shall submit a revision 
                                to the program to meet any requirements 
                                that the Administrator may prescribe 
                                under that section.
                  (D) Permit programs.--A State applicable 
                implementation plan shall include each of the 
                following:
                          (i) Provisions to require permits, in 
                        accordance with sections 215102(c)(5) and 
                        215103 of this title, for the construction and 
                        operation of each new or modified major 
                        stationary source (with respect to ozone) to be 
                        located in the marginal area.
                          (ii) Provisions to correct requirements in 
                        (or add requirements to) the plan concerning 
                        permit programs as were required under section 
                        172(b)(6) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
                        7502(b)(6)) (as in effect before November 15, 
                        1990), as interpreted in regulations of the 
                        Administrator promulgated as of November 15, 
                        1990.
          (4) Periodic inventory.--
                  (A) General requirement.--Not later than the end of 
                each 3-year period after submission of the inventory 
                under paragraph (2) until the marginal area is 
                redesignated to attainment, the State shall submit a 
                revised inventory meeting the requirements of paragraph 
                (2).
                  (B) Emissions statements.--
                          (i) In general.--At least annually, a State 
                        shall submit a revision to the State 
                        implementation plan to require that the owner 
                        or operator of each stationary source of 
                        nitrogen oxides or volatile organic compounds 
                        provide the State with a statement, in such 
                        form as the Administrator may prescribe (or 
                        accept an equivalent alternative developed by 
                        the State), for classes or categories of 
                        sources, showing the actual emissions of 
                        nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds 
                        from that source. The statement shall contain a 
                        certification that the information contained in 
                        the statement is accurate to the best knowledge 
                        of the individual certifying the statement.
                          (ii) Waiver.--A State may waive the 
                        application of clause (i) to any class or 
                        category of stationary sources that emit less 
                        than 25 tons per year of volatile organic 
                        compounds or nitrogen oxides if the State, in 
                        its submissions under paragraph (2) or 
                        subparagraph (A), provides an inventory of 
                        emissions from the class or category of sources 
                        based on the use of the emission factors 
                        established by the Administrator or other 
                        methods acceptable to the Administrator.
          (5) General offset requirement.--For purposes of satisfying 
        the emission offset requirements of this chapter, the ratio of 
        total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to 
        total increased emissions of volatile organic compounds shall 
        be at least 1.1 to 1.
          (6) Schedule.--The Administrator may require States to submit 
        a schedule for submitting any of the revisions or other items 
        required under this subsection.
          (7) Applicability of subsection in lieu of other 
        requirements.--The requirements of this subsection shall apply 
        in lieu of any requirement that the State submit a 
        demonstration that the applicable implementation plan provides 
        for attainment of the ozone standard by the applicable 
        attainment date in any marginal area.
          (8) Contingency measures.--Section 215102(c)(9) of this title 
        shall not apply to a marginal area.
  (b) Moderate Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of a 
        moderate area is located shall include in its applicable 
        implementation plan the provisions described under this 
        subsection and subsection (a).
          (2) Plan provisions for reasonable further progress.--
                  (A) Definition of baseline emissions.--In this 
                paragraph, the term ``baseline emissions'' means the 
                total amount of actual volatile organic compound or 
                nitrogen oxide emissions from all anthropogenic sources 
                in a moderate area during calendar year 1990, excluding 
                emissions that would be eliminated under the 
                regulations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of 
                subparagraph (D).
                  (B) General rule.--
                          (i) Plan provision.--A State applicable 
                        implementation plan shall provide for volatile 
                        organic compound emission reductions of at 
                        least 15 percent from baseline emissions, 
                        accounting for any growth in emissions after 
                        1990. The plan shall provide for such specific 
                        annual reductions in emissions of volatile 
                        organic compounds and nitrogen oxides as are 
                        necessary to attain the primary NAAQS for ozone 
                        by the attainment date applicable under this 
                        division.
                          (ii) Percentage.--
                                  (I) In general.--A percentage of less 
                                than 15 percent may be used for 
                                purposes of clause (i) in the case of a 
                                State that demonstrates to the 
                                satisfaction of the Administrator 
                                that--
                                          (aa) new source review 
                                        provisions are applicable in 
                                        the nonattainment areas in the 
                                        same manner and to the same 
                                        extent as are required under 
                                        subsection (e) in the case of 
                                        extreme areas (with the 
                                        exception that, in applying 
                                        those provisions, the terms 
                                        ``major source'' and ``major 
                                        stationary source'' shall 
                                        include (in addition to the 
                                        sources described in section 
                                        201101 of this title) any 
                                        stationary source or group of 
                                        sources located within a 
                                        contiguous area and under 
                                        common control that emits, or 
                                        has the potential to emit, at 
                                        least 5 tons per year of 
                                        volatile organic compounds);
                                          (bb) reasonably available 
                                        control technology is required 
                                        for all existing major sources 
                                        (as defined in item (aa)); and
                                          (cc) the plan reflecting a 
                                        lesser percentage than 15 
                                        percent includes all measures 
                                        that can feasibly be 
                                        implemented in an area, in 
                                        light of technological 
                                        achievability.
                                  (II) Measures achieved in practice.--
                                To qualify for a lesser percentage 
                                under this clause, a State shall 
                                demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
                                Administrator that the plan for the 
                                area includes the measures that are 
                                achieved in practice by sources in the 
                                same source category in nonattainment 
                                areas of the next higher 
                                classification.
                          (iii) Applicability of subparagraph.--This 
                        subparagraph shall not apply in the case of 
                        nitrogen oxides for areas for which the 
                        Administrator determines (when the 
                        Administrator approves a plan or plan revision) 
                        that additional reductions of nitrogen oxides 
                        would not contribute to attainment.
                  (C) General rule for creditability of reductions.--
                Except as provided under subparagraph (D), emission 
                reductions are creditable toward the 15 percent 
                required under subparagraph (B) to the extent that the 
                emission reductions have actually occurred, as of 6 
                years after November 15, 1990, as a result of the 
                implementation of measures required under the 
                applicable implementation plan, regulations promulgated 
                by the Administrator, or a permit under subdivision 6.
                  (D) Limits on creditability of reductions.--Emission 
                reductions from the following measures are not 
                creditable toward the 15 percent reductions required 
                under subparagraph (B):
                          (i) Any measure relating to motor vehicle 
                        exhaust or evaporative emissions promulgated by 
                        the Administrator by January 1, 1990.
                          (ii) Regulations concerning Reid vapor 
                        pressure promulgated by the Administrator by 
                        November 15, 1990, or required to be 
                        promulgated under section 221111(h) of this 
                        title.
                          (iii) Measures required under subsection

        the emission offset requirements of this chapter, the ratio of 
        total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to 
        total increased emissions of volatile organic compounds shall 
        be at least 1.15 to 1.
  (c) Serious Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Except as otherwise specified in paragraph 
        (6), each State in which all or part of a serious area is 
        located shall, with respect to the serious area (or portion 
        thereof, to the extent specified in this subsection), include 
        in its applicable implementation plan (including the plan 
        items) the provisions described under this subsection and 
        subsection (b) (except that any reference to an attainment date 
        in subsection (b), incorporated by reference in this 
        subsection, shall refer to the attainment date for serious 
        areas).
          (2) Major source; major stationary source.--For any serious 
        area, the terms ``major source'' and ``major stationary 
        source'' include (in addition to the sources described in 
        section 201101 of this title) any stationary source or group of 
        sources located within a contiguous area and under common 
        control that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 50 
        tons per year of volatile organic compounds.
          (3) Enhanced monitoring.--
                  (A) Regulations.--To obtain more comprehensive and 
                representative data on ozone air pollution, the 
                Administrator shall promulgate regulations, after 
                notice and public comment, for enhanced monitoring of 
                ozone, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds.

                maintenance of monitors.
                  (B) State action.--Immediately following the 
                promulgation of regulations by the Administrator 
                relating to enhanced monitoring, a State shall commence 
                such actions as may be necessary to adopt and implement 
                a program based on the regulations to improve 
                monitoring for ambient concentrations of ozone, 
                nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds and to 
                improve monitoring of emissions of nitrogen oxides and 
                volatile organic compounds. Each State implementation 
                plan for the area shall contain measures to improve the 
                ambient monitoring of those air pollutants.
          (4) Attainment demonstrations; reasonable further progress 
        demonstrations.--
                  (A) In general.--A State applicable implementation 
                plan shall include an attainment demonstration 
                described in subparagraph (B) and a reasonable further 
                progress demonstration described in subparagraph (C).
                  (B) Attainment demonstration.--A State applicable 
                implementation plan shall include a demonstration that 
                the plan will provide for attainment of the ozone NAAQS 
                by the applicable attainment date. The attainment 
                demonstration shall be based on photochemical grid 
                modeling or any other analytical method determined by 
                the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, 
                to be at least as effective.
                  (C) Reasonable further progress demonstration.--
                          (i) Volatile organic compound control.--
                                  (I) In general.--A State applicable 
                                implementation plan shall include a 
                                demonstration that the plan will result 
                                in volatile organic compound emission 
                                reductions from the baseline emissions 
                                (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(A)) 
                                equal to 1 of the following amounts 
                                averaged over each consecutive 3-year 
                                period beginning 6 years after November 
                                15, 1990, until the attainment date:
                                          (aa) At least 3 percent of 
                                        baseline emissions each year.
                                          (bb) An amount less than 3 
                                        percent of baseline emissions 
                                        each year, if the State 
                                        demonstrates to the 
                                        satisfaction of the 
                                        Administrator that the plan 
                                        reflecting such a lesser amount 
                                        includes all measures that can 
                                        feasibly be implemented in the 
                                        area, in light of technological 
                                        achievability.
                                  (II) Less than 3 percent reduction.--
                                To lessen the 3 percent requirement 
                                under subclause (I)(bb), a State shall 
                                demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
                                Administrator that the plan for the 
                                area includes the measures that are 
                                achieved in practice by sources in the 
                                same source category in nonattainment 
                                areas of the next higher 
                                classification. Any determination to 
                                lessen the 3 percent requirement shall 
                                be reviewed at each applicable 
                                milestone under subsection (g) and 
                                revised to reflect such new measures 
                                (if any) achieved in practice by 
                                sources in the same category in any 
                                State, allowing a reasonable amount of 
                                time to implement the measures.
                                  (III) Calculation of emission 
                                reductions.--The emission reductions 
                                described in this clause shall be 
                                calculated in accordance with 
                                subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection 
                                (b)(2). The reductions creditable for 
                                the period beginning 6 years after 
                                November 15, 1990, shall include 
                                reductions that occurred before that 
                                period, calculated in accordance with 
                                subsection (b)(2), that exceed the 15-
                                percent amount of reductions required 
                                under subsection (b)(2)(B).
                          (ii) Nitrogen oxide control.--A provision 
                        under this subparagraph may contain, in lieu of 
                        the volatile organic compound control 
                        demonstration described in clause (i), a 
                        demonstration to the satisfaction of the 
                        Administrator that the applicable 
                        implementation plan provides for reductions of 
                        emissions of volatile organic compounds and 
                        nitrogen oxides (calculated according to the 
                        creditability provisions of subparagraphs (C) 
                        and (D) of subsection (b)(2)), that would 
                        result in a reduction in ozone concentrations 
                        at least equivalent to that which would result 
                        from the amount of emission reductions required 
                        under clause (i). The Administrator shall issue 
                        guidance concerning the conditions under which 
                        nitrogen oxide control may be substituted for 
                        volatile organic compound control or may be 
                        combined with volatile organic compound control 
                        to maximize the reduction in ozone air 
                        pollution. In accord with such guidance, a 
                        lesser percentage of volatile organic compounds 
                        may be accepted as an adequate demonstration 
                        for purposes of this subsection.
          (5) Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program.--
                  (A) Requirement for submission.--A State shall 
                include in its applicable implementation plan a 
                provision for an enhanced program to reduce hydrocarbon 
                emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions from in-use 
                motor vehicles registered in each urbanized area (in 
                the nonattainment area), as defined by the Bureau of 
                the Census, with a 1980 population of 200,000 or more.
                  (B) Effective date of state programs; guidance.--
                          (i) In general.--The State program required 
                        under subparagraph (A) shall comply in all 
                        respects with guidance published in the Federal 
                        Register (and from time to time revised) by the 
                        Administrator for enhanced vehicle inspection 
                        and maintenance programs.
                          (ii) Contents.--The guidance shall include--
                                  (I) a performance standard achievable 
                                by a program combining emission 
                                testing, including on-road emission 
                                testing, with inspection to detect 
                                tampering with emission control devices 
                                and misfueling for all light-duty 
                                vehicles and all light-duty trucks 
                                subject to standards under section 
                                221102 of this title; and
                                  (II) program administration features 
                                necessary to reasonably ensure that 
                                adequate management resources, tools, 
                                and practices are in place to attain 
                                and maintain the performance standard.
                          (iii) Compliance.--Compliance with the 
                        performance standard under clause (ii)(I) shall 
                        be determined using a method established by the 
                        Administrator.
                  (C) State program.--
                          (i) In general.--A State program under 
                        subparagraph (A) shall include, at a minimum, 
                        each of the following elements:
                                  (I) Computerized emission analyzers, 
                                including on-road testing devices.
                                  (II) No waivers for vehicles and 
                                parts covered by the emission control 
                                performance warranty as provided for in 
                                section 221107(c) of this title unless 
                                a warranty remedy has been denied in 
                                writing, or for tampering-related 
                                repairs.
                                  (III) In view of the air quality 
                                purpose of the program, if, for any 
                                vehicle, waivers are permitted for 
                                emissions-related repairs not covered 
                                by warranty, an expenditure to qualify 
                                for the waiver of an amount of $450 or 
                                more for such repairs (adjusted 
                                annually as determined by the 
                                Administrator on the basis of the 
                                Consumer Price Index in the same manner 
                                as provided in subdivision 6).
                                  (IV) Enforcement through denial of 
                                vehicle registration (except for any 
                                program in operation before November 
                                15, 1990, whose enforcement mechanism 
                                is demonstrated to the Administrator to 
                                be more effective than the applicable 
                                vehicle registration program in 
                                ensuring that noncomplying vehicles are 
                                not operated on public roads).
                                  (V) Annual emission testing and 
                                necessary adjustment, repair, and 
                                maintenance, unless the State 
                                demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                                Administrator that a biennial 
                                inspection, in combination with other 
                                features of the program that exceed the 
                                requirements of this division, will 
                                result in emission reductions that 
                                equal or exceed the reductions that can 
                                be obtained through annual inspections.
                                  (VI) Operation of the program on a 
                                centralized basis, unless the State 
                                demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                                Administrator that a decentralized 
                                program will be equally effective. An 
                                electronically connected testing 
                                system, a licensing system, or other 
                                measures (or any combination thereof) 
                                may be considered, in accordance with 
                                criteria established by the 
                                Administrator, as equally effective for 
                                such purposes.
                                  (VII) Inspection of emission control 
                                diagnostic systems and the maintenance 
                                or repair of malfunctions or system 
                                deterioration identified by or 
                                affecting such diagnostics systems.
                          (ii) Biennial reports.--Each State shall 
                        biennially submit to the Administrator a report 
                        that assesses the emission reductions achieved 
                        by the program required under this paragraph 
                        based on data collected during inspection and 
                        repair of vehicles. The methods used to assess 
                        the emission reductions shall be those 
                        established by the Administrator.
          (6) Clean-fuel vehicle programs.--
                  (A) In general.--Except to the extent that substitute 
                provisions are approved by the Administrator under 
                subparagraph (B), a State applicable implementation 
                plan shall include, for each area described under 
                chapter 225 and for each area that opts into the clean 
                fuel-vehicle program as provided in chapter 225, such 
                measures as may be necessary to ensure the 
                effectiveness of the applicable provisions of the 
                clean-fuel vehicle program prescribed under chapter 
                225, including all measures necessary to make the use 
                of clean alternative fuels in clean-fuel vehicles (as 
                defined in chapter 225) economic from the standpoint of 
                vehicle owners.
                  (B) Substitute provisions.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        approve, as a substitute for all or a portion 
                        of the clean-fuel vehicle program prescribed 
                        under chapter 225, any provision of a relevant 
                        applicable implementation plan that in the 
                        Administrator's judgment will achieve long-term 
                        reductions in ozone-producing and toxic air 
                        emissions equal to those achieved under chapter 
                        225, or the percentage thereof attributable to 
                        the portion of the clean-fuel vehicle program 
                        for which the provision is to substitute.
                          (ii) Requirement for approval.--The 
                        Administrator may approve such a provision only 
                        if it consists exclusively of provisions other 
                        than those required under this division for the 
                        area.
                          (iii) Deadline.--Any State seeking approval 
                        of such a provision must have submitted the 
                        revision to the Administrator within 24 months 
                        of November 15, 1990.
                          (iv) Rulemaking.--The Administrator shall 
                        publish the provision submitted by a State in 
                        the Federal Register on receipt. The notice 
                        shall constitute a notice of proposed 
                        rulemaking on whether to approve the provision 
                        and shall be deemed to comply with the 
                        requirements concerning notices of proposed 
                        rulemaking contained in sections 553 to 557 of 
                        title 5.
                          (v) No provision under subparagraph (a).--
                        Where the Administrator approves such a 
                        provision for any area, the State need not 
                        submit the provision required by subparagraph 
                        (A) for the area with respect to the portions 
                        of the Federal clean-fuel vehicle program for 
                        which the Administrator has approved the 
                        provision as a substitute.
                  (C) Failure to submit program.--If the Administrator 
                determines under section 215111 of this title that a 
                State has failed to submit any portion of the program 
                required under subparagraph (A), in addition to any 
                sanctions available under section 215111 of this title, 
                the State may not receive credit, in any demonstration 
                of attainment or reasonable further progress for the 
                area, for any emission reductions from implementation 
                of the corresponding aspects of the Federal clean-fuel 
                vehicle requirements established in chapter 225.
          (7) Transportation control.--
                  (A) In general.--Every 3 years, a State shall submit 
                a demonstration whether current aggregate vehicle 
                mileage, aggregate vehicle emissions, congestion 
                levels, and other relevant parameters are consistent 
                with those used for the area's demonstration of 
                attainment.
                  (B) Exceedance.--Where such parameters and emissions 
                levels exceed the levels projected for purposes of the 
                area's attainment demonstration, the State shall within 
                18 months develop and submit a revision of the 
                applicable implementation plan that includes a 
                transportation control measures program that includes 
                measures described in section 211108(f) of this title 
                that will reduce emissions to levels that are 
                consistent with emission levels projected in the 
                demonstration. In considering such measures, the State 
                should ensure adequate access to downtown, other 
                commercial, and residential areas and should avoid 
                measures that increase or relocate emissions and 
                congestion rather than reduce them.
                  (C) Development; schedules.--A revision under 
                subparagraph (B)--
                          (i) shall be developed in accordance with 
                        guidance issued by the Administrator pursuant 
                        to section 211108(e) of this title and with the 
                        requirements of section 215104(b) of this 
                        title; and
                          (ii) shall include implementation and funding 
                        schedules that achieve expeditious emissions 
                        reductions in accordance with implementation 
                        plan projections.
          (8) De minimis rule.--The new source review provisions under 
        this chapter shall ensure that increased emissions of volatile 
        organic compounds resulting from any physical change in, or 
        change in the method of operation of, a stationary source 
        located in the serious area shall not be considered de minimis 
        for purposes of determining the applicability of the permit 
        requirements established by this division unless the increase 
        in net emissions of volatile organic compounds from the 
        stationary source does not exceed 25 tons when aggregated with 
        all other net increases in emissions from the source over any 
        period of 5 consecutive calendar years that includes the 
        calendar year in which the increase occurred.
          (9) Special rule for modification of sources emitting less 
        than 100 tons.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), in the case of any major stationary source of 
                volatile organic compounds located in the serious area 
                (other than a source that emits or has the potential to 
                emit 100 tons or more of volatile organic compounds per 
                year), whenever any change (as described in section 
                211111(a)(2) of this title) at that source results in 
                any increase (other than a de minimis increase) in 
                emissions of volatile organic compounds from any 
                discrete operation, unit, or other pollutant emitting 
                activity at the source, the change shall be considered 
                to be a modification for purposes of sections 
                215102(c)(5) and 215103(a) of this title, but in 
                applying section 215103(a)(1)(B) of this title in the 
                case of any such modification, the best available 
                control technology (as defined in section 213102 of 
                this title) shall be substituted for the lowest 
                achievable emission rate.
                  (B) Election to offset.--A change described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall not be considered to be a 
                modification for the purposes described in subparagraph 
                (A) if the owner or operator of the source elects to 
                offset the increase by a greater reduction in emissions 
                of volatile organic compounds concerned from other 
                operations, units, or activities within the source at 
                an internal offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 1.
                  (C) Election not made.--If the owner or operator does 
                not make the election described in subparagraph (B), 
                the change shall be considered a modification for the 
                purposes described in subparagraph (A), but in applying 
                section 215103(a)(1)(B) of this title in the case of 
                any such modification, the best available control 
                technology, as defined in section 213102 of this title, 
                shall be substituted for the lowest achievable emission 
                rate.
                  (D) Policies and procedures.--The Administrator shall 
                establish and publish policies and procedures for 
                implementing this paragraph.
          (10) Special rule for modifications of sources emitting 100 
        tons or more.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), in the case of any major stationary source of 
                volatile organic compounds located in the serious area 
                that emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons or 
                more of volatile organic compounds per year, whenever 
                any change (as described in section 211111(a)(2) of 
                this title) at that source results in any increase 
                (other than a de minimis increase) in emissions of 
                volatile organic compounds from any discrete operation, 
                unit, or other pollutant emitting activity at the 
                source, the change shall be considered a modification 
                for purposes of sections 215102(c)(5) and 215103(a) of 
                this title.
                  (B) Election to offset.--If the owner or operator of 
                the source elects to offset the increase by a greater 
                reduction in emissions of volatile organic compounds 
                from other operations, units, or activities within the 
                source at an internal offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 
                1, the requirements of section 215103(a)(1)(B) of this 
                title shall not apply.
          (11) Contingency provisions.--In addition to the contingency 
        provisions required under section 215102(c)(9) of this title, 
        the plan revision shall provide for the implementation of 
        specific measures to be undertaken if the serious area fails to 
        meet any applicable milestone. The measures shall be included 
        in the plan provision as contingency measures to take effect 
        without further action by the State or the Administrator on a 
        failure by the State to meet the applicable milestone.
          (12) General offset requirement.--For purposes of satisfying 
        the emission offset requirements of this chapter, the ratio of 
        total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to 
        total increase emissions of an air pollutant shall be at least 
        1.2 to 1.
  (d) Severe Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of a severe 
        area is located shall, with respect to the severe area, include 
        in its applicable implementation plan the provisions (including 
        plan items) described under this subsection and subsection (c) 
        (except that any reference to an attainment date in subsection 
        (b) or (c), incorporated by reference in this subsection, shall 
        refer to the attainment date for severe areas).
          (2) Major source; major stationary source.--For any severe 
        area, the terms ``major source'' and ``major stationary 
        source'' include (in addition to the sources described in 
        section 201101 of this title) any stationary source or group of 
        sources located within a contiguous area and under common 
        control that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 25 
        tons per year of volatile organic compounds.
          (3) Vehicle miles traveled.--
                  (A) Transportation control strategies and 
                transportation control measures.--
                          (i) In general.--A State applicable 
                        implementation plan shall include a provision 
                        that identifies and adopts specific enforceable 
                        transportation control strategies and 
                        transportation control measures to offset any 
                        growth in emissions from growth in vehicle 
                        miles traveled or numbers of vehicle trips in 
                        the severe area and to attain reduction in 
                        motor vehicle emissions as necessary, in 
                        combination with other emission reduction 
                        requirements of this subchapter, to comply with 
                        subsections (b)(2) and (c)(4)(C)(i).
                          (ii) Considerations.--The State shall 
                        consider measures specified in section 
                        211108(f) of this title and choose from among 
                        and implement those measures as necessary to 
                        demonstrate attainment with the NAAQSes. In 
                        considering such measures, the State should 
                        ensure adequate access to downtown, other 
                        commercial, and residential areas and should 
                        avoid measures that increase or relocate 
                        emissions and congestion rather than reduce 
                        them.
                  (B) Programs to reduce work-related vehicle trips and 
                miles traveled by employees.--
                          (i) In general.--The State may include in its 
                        applicable implementation plan a provision 
                        requiring employers in the severe area to 
                        implement programs to reduce work-related 
                        vehicle trips and miles traveled by employees.
                          (ii) Guidance; occupancy per vehicle.--A 
                        provision described in clause (i) shall be 
                        developed in accordance with guidance issued by 
                        the Administrator pursuant to section 211108(f) 
                        of this title and may require that employers in 
                        the severe area increase average passenger 
                        occupancy per vehicle in commuting trips 
                        between home and the workplace during peak 
                        travel periods. The guidance of the 
                        Administrator may specify average vehicle 
                        occupancy rates that vary for locations within 
                        a nonattainment area (suburban, center city, 
                        business district) or among nonattainment areas 
                        reflecting existing occupancy rates and the 
                        availability of high occupancy modes.
                          (iii) Alternative methods.--Any State 
                        required to submit a revision under section 
                        182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
                        7511a(d)(1)(B)) (as in effect before December 
                        23, 1995) containing provisions requiring 
                        employers to reduce work-related vehicle trips 
                        and miles traveled by employees may, in 
                        accordance with State law, remove those 
                        provisions from the implementation plan, or 
                        withdraw its submission, if the State notifies 
                        the Administrator, in writing, that the State 
                        has undertaken, or will undertake, 1 or more 
                        alternative methods that will achieve emission 
                        reductions equivalent to those to be achieved 
                        by the removed or withdrawn provisions.
          (4) Offset requirement.--For purposes of satisfying the 
        offset requirements pursuant to this chapter, the ratio of 
        total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to 
        total increased emissions of volatile organic compounds shall 
        be at least 1.3 to 1, except that if the State applicable 
        implementation plan requires all existing major sources in the 
        nonattainment area to use best available control technology (as 
        defined in section 213102 of this title) for the control of 
        volatile organic compounds, the ratio shall be at least 1.2 to 
        1.
          (5) Enforcement under section 215206.--The State shall submit 
        a plan revision that includes the provisions required under 
        section 215206 of this title.
  (e) Extreme Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of an 
        extreme area is located shall, with respect to the extreme 
        area, include in its applicable implementation plan the 
        provisions (including plan items) described under this 
        subsection and subsection (d) (except that any reference to an 
        attainment date in subsection (b), (c), or (d), incorporated by 
        reference in this subsection, shall refer to the attainment 
        date for extreme areas).
          (2) Inapplicability of certain provisions.--Subsection 
        (b)(2)(B)(ii) and paragraphs (4)(C)(i)(I)(bb), (8), (9), and 
        (10) of subsection (c) shall not apply in the case of an 
        extreme area.
          (3) Major source; major stationary source.--For any extreme 
        area, the terms ``major source'' and ``major stationary 
        source'' include (in addition to the sources described in 
        section 201101 of this title) any stationary source or group of 
        sources located within a contiguous area and under common 
        control that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 10 
        tons per year of volatile organic compounds.
          (4) Offset requirement.--For purposes of satisfying the 
        offset requirements pursuant to this chapter, the ratio of 
        total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to 
        total increased emissions of volatile organic compounds shall 
        be at least 1.5 to 1, except that if the State plan requires 
        all existing major sources in the nonattainment area to use 
        best available control technology (as defined in section 213102 
        of this title) for the control of volatile organic compounds, 
        the ratio shall be at least 1.2 to 1.
          (5) Modifications.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), any change (as described in section 211111(a)(2) 
                of this title) at a major stationary source that 
                results in any increase in emissions from any discrete 
                operation, unit, or other pollutant-emitting activity 
                at the source shall be considered a modification for 
                purposes of sections 215102(c)(5) and 215103(a) of this 
                title.
                  (B) Election to offset.--For purposes of complying 
                with the offset requirement pursuant to section 
                215103(a)(1)(A) of this title, any change described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall not be considered to be a 
                modification if the owner or operator of the source 
                elects to offset the increase by a greater reduction in 
                emissions of the air pollutant concerned from other 
                discrete operations, units, or activities within the 
                source at an internal offset ratio of at least 1.3 to 
                1.
                  (C) Nonapplicability of offset provisions.--The 
                offset requirements of this chapter shall not be 
                applicable in extreme areas to a modification of an 
                existing source if the modification consists of 
                installation of equipment required to comply with the 
                applicable implementation plan, a permit, or this 
                division.
          (6) Use of clean fuels or advanced control technology.--
                  (A) Definition of primary fuel.--In this paragraph, 
                the term ``primary fuel'' means the fuel that is used 
                by an electric utility or industrial or commercial 
                boiler 90 percent or more of the operating time.
                  (B) Certain electric utilities and industrial and 
                commercial boilers.--For extreme areas, a State 
                applicable implementation plan shall include a 
                provision requiring that each new, modified, and 
                existing electric utility and industrial and commercial 
                boiler that emits more than 25 tons per year of 
                nitrogen oxides--
                          (i) burn as its primary fuel natural gas, 
                        methanol, or ethanol (or a comparably low-
                        polluting fuel); or
                          (ii) use advanced control technology (such as 
                        catalytic control technology or other 
                        comparably effective control methods) for 
                        reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.
                  (C) Applicability.--This paragraph shall not apply 
                during any natural gas supply emergency (as defined in 
                title III of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 
                U.S.C. 3361 et seq.)).
          (7) Traffic control measures during heavy traffic hours.--For 
        extreme areas, a State applicable implementation plan may 
        contain provisions establishing traffic control measures 
        applicable during heavy traffic hours to reduce the use of 
        high-polluting vehicles or heavy-duty vehicles, notwithstanding 
        any other provision of law.
          (8) New technologies.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator may, in accordance 
                with section 211110 of this title, approve provisions 
                of an implementation plan for an extreme area that 
                anticipate development of new control techniques or 
                improvement of existing control technologies, and an 
                attainment demonstration based on such provisions, if 
                the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                Administrator that--
                          (i) such provisions are not necessary to 
                        achieve the incremental emission reductions 
                        required during the 1st 10 years after November 
                        15, 1990; and
                          (ii) the State has submitted enforceable 
                        commitments to develop and adopt contingency 
                        measures to be implemented as set forth in 
                        subparagraph (B) if the anticipated 
                        technologies do not achieve planned reductions.
                  (B) Submission and approval or disapproval of 
                contingency measures.--Contingency measures described 
                in subparagraph (A) shall be submitted to the 
                Administrator not later than 3 years before proposed 
                implementation of the plan provisions and approved or 
                disapproved by the Administrator in accordance with 
                section 211110 of this title.
                  (C) Adequacy.--The contingency measures shall be 
                adequate to produce emission reductions sufficient, in 
                conjunction with other approved plan provisions, to 
                achieve the periodic emission reductions required by 
                subsection (b)(2) or (c)(4) and attainment by the 
                applicable dates.
                  (D) Failure to achieve emission reduction.--If the 
                Administrator determines that an extreme area has 
                failed to achieve an emission reduction requirement set 
                forth in subsection (b)(2) or (c)(4), and that the 
                failure is due in whole or part to an inability to 
                fully implement provisions approved pursuant to this 
                subsection, the Administrator shall require the State 
                to implement the contingency measures to the extent 
                necessary to ensure compliance with subsections (b)(2) 
                and (c)(4).
  (f) Nitrogen Oxide Requirements.--
          (1) In general.--
                  (A) Applicability of provisions relating to volatile 
                organic compounds.--The plan provisions required under 
                this subchapter for major stationary sources of 
                volatile organic compounds shall apply to major 
                stationary sources (as defined in section 201101 of 
                this title and subsections (c), (d), and (e)) of 
                nitrogen oxides.
                  (B) Nonapplicability of subsection.--This subsection 
                shall not apply in the case of nitrogen oxides for--
                          (i) sources for which the Administrator 
                        determines (when the Administrator approves a 
                        plan or plan revision) that net air quality 
                        benefits are greater in the absence of 
                        reductions of nitrogen oxides from the sources 
                        concerned; or
                          (ii)(I) nonattainment areas not within an 
                        ozone transport region under section 215205 of 
                        this title, if the Administrator determines 
                        (when the Administrator approves a plan or plan 
                        revision) that additional reductions of 
                        nitrogen oxides would not contribute to 
                        attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the area; 
                        or
                          (II) nonattainment areas within an ozone 
                        transport region under section 215205 of this 
                        title, if the Administrator determines (when 
                        the Administrator approves a plan or plan 
                        revision) that additional reductions of 
                        nitrogen oxides would not produce net ozone air 
                        quality benefits in the ozone transport region.
                  (C) Considerations.--The Administrator shall, in the 
                Administrator's determinations under subparagraph (B), 
                consider the study required under section 215207 of 
                this title.
          (2) Limitation on applicability.--
                  (A) In general.--If the Administrator determines that 
                excess reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides would 
                be achieved under paragraph (1), the Administrator may 
                limit the application of paragraph (1) to the extent 
                necessary to avoid achieving the excess reductions.
                  (B) Excess emission reductions.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, excess reductions in emissions of nitrogen 
                oxides are--
                          (i) emission reductions for which the 
                        Administrator determines that net air quality 
                        benefits are greater in the absence of such 
                        emission reductions; or
                          (ii)(I) for nonattainment areas not within an 
                        ozone transport region under section 215205 of 
                        this title, emission reductions that the 
                        Administrator determines would not contribute 
                        to attainment of the NAAQS for ozone in the 
                        area; or
                          (II) for nonattainment areas within an ozone 
                        transport region under section 215205 of this 
                        title, emission reductions that the 
                        Administrator determines would not produce net 
                        ozone air quality benefits in the ozone 
                        transport region.
          (3) Petition for determination.--A person may petition the 
        Administrator for a determination under paragraph (1) or (2) 
        with respect to any nonattainment area or any ozone transport 
        region under section 215205 of this title. The Administrator 
        shall grant or deny such a petition within 6 months after its 
        filing with the Administrator.
  (g) Applicable Milestones.--
          (1) Reductions in emissions.--At intervals of 3 years, a 
        State shall determine whether each nonattainment area (other 
        than a marginal area or moderate area) has achieved a reduction 
        in emissions during the preceding intervals equivalent to the 
        total emission reductions required to be achieved by the end of 
        that interval pursuant to subsection (b)(2) and the 
        corresponding requirements of subsections (c)(4)(C), (d), and 
        (e).
          (2) Compliance demonstration.--For each nonattainment area 
        described in paragraph (1), not later than 90 days after the 
        date on which an applicable milestone occurs (not including an 
        attainment date on which an applicable milestone occurs in a 
        case in which the standard has been attained), each State in 
        which all or part of the area is located shall submit to the 
        Administrator a demonstration that the applicable milestone has 
        been met. A demonstration under this paragraph shall be 
        submitted in such form and manner, and shall contain such 
        information and analysis, as the Administrator shall require, 
        by regulation. The Administrator shall determine whether or not 
        a State's demonstration is adequate within 90 days after the 
        Administrator's receipt of a demonstration that contains the 
        information and analysis required by the Administrator.
          (3) Serious areas and severe areas.--
                  (A) State election.--If a State fails to submit a 
                demonstration under paragraph (2) for any serious area 
                or severe area within the required period or if the 
                Administrator determines that the serious area or 
                severe area has not met any applicable milestone, the 
                State shall elect, within 90 days after the failure or 
                determination--
                          (i) to have the area reclassified to the next 
                        higher classification;
                          (ii) to implement specific additional 
                        measures that are adequate, as determined by 
                        the Administrator, to meet the next applicable 
                        milestone as provided in the applicable 
                        contingency plan; or
                          (iii) to adopt an economic incentive program 
                        as described in paragraph (4).
                  (B) Additional measures.--If the State makes an 
                election under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator 
                shall--
                          (i) within 90 days after the election, review 
                        the applicable contingency plan; and
                          (ii) if the Administrator finds the 
                        contingency plan inadequate, require further 
                        measures necessary to meet the applicable 
                        milestone.
                  (C) Acceptance of election.--If the State makes an 
                election, the election shall be deemed accepted by the 
                Administrator as meeting the election requirement.
                  (D) Failure to make election.--If the State fails to 
                make an election required under this paragraph within 
                the required 90-day period or within 6 months 
                thereafter, the serious area or severe area shall be 
                reclassified to the next higher classification by 
                operation of law at the expiration of the 6-month 
                period.
                  (E) Plan revision.--Within 12 months after the date 
                required for the State to make an election, the State 
                shall submit a revision of the applicable 
                implementation plan for the serious area or severe area 
                that meets the requirements of this paragraph. The 
                Administrator shall review the plan revision and 
                approve or disapprove the revision within 9 months 
                after the date of its submission.
          (4) Economic incentive program.--
                  (A) In general.--
                          (i) Consistency with regulations; 
                        sufficiency.--An economic incentive program 
                        under this paragraph shall be consistent with 
                        regulations published by the Administrator and 
                        sufficient, in combination with other elements 
                        of the State plan, to achieve the next 
                        applicable milestone.
                          (ii) Elements.--The State program may 
                        include--
                                  (I) a nondiscriminatory system, 
                                consistent with applicable law 
                                regarding interstate commerce, of 
                                State-established emission fees;
                                  (II) a system of marketable permits;
                                  (III) a system of State fees on sale 
                                or manufacture of products the use of 
                                which contributes to ozone formation;
                                  (IV) incentives and requirements to 
                                reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle 
                                miles traveled in the serious area or 
                                severe area, including any of the 
                                transportation control measures 
                                identified in section 211108(f) of this 
                                title; or
                                  (V) any combination of the foregoing 
                                or other similar measures.
                  (B) Regulations.--The Administrator shall publish 
                regulations for the programs to be adopted pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A). The regulations shall include model 
                plan provisions that may be adopted for reducing 
                emissions from permitted stationary sources, area 
                sources, and mobile sources.
                  (C) Guidelines.--The guidelines shall require that 
                any revenues generated by the plan provisions adopted 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be used by the State 
                for any of the following:
                          (i) Providing incentives for achieving 
                        emission reductions.
                          (ii) Providing assistance for the development 
                        of innovative technologies for the control of 
                        ozone air pollution and for the development of 
                        lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings. 
                        Such assistance shall not provide for the 
                        payment of more than 75 percent of the costs of 
                        any project to develop such a technology or the 
                        costs of development of a lower-polluting 
                        solvent or surface coating.
                          (iii) Funding the administrative costs of 
                        State programs under this division. Not more 
                        than 50 percent of such revenues may be used 
                        for purposes of this clause.
          (5) Extreme areas.--If a State fails to submit a 
        demonstration under paragraph (2) for any extreme area within 
        the required period, or if the Administrator determines that 
        the area has not met any applicable milestone, the State shall, 
        within 9 months after the failure or determination, submit a 
        plan revision to implement an economic incentive program that 
        meets the requirements of paragraph (4). The Administrator 
        shall review the plan revision and approve or disapprove the 
        revision within 9 months after the date of its submission.
  (h) Rural Transport Areas.--
          (1) Treatment by operation of law.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of this section or section 215202 of this title, a 
        State containing an ozone nonattainment area that does not 
        include, and is not adjacent to, any part of a Metropolitan 
        Statistical Area or, where one exists, a Consolidated 
        Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the Bureau of the 
        Census), which area is treated by the Administrator, in the 
        Administrator's discretion, as a rural transport area within 
        the meaning of paragraph (2), shall be treated by operation of 
        law as satisfying the requirements of this section if the State 
        applicable implementation plan includes the provisions required 
        under subsection (a).
          (2) Treatment by the administrator.--The Administrator may 
        treat an ozone nonattainment area as a rural transport area if 
        the Administrator finds that sources of volatile organic 
        compounds emissions (and, where the Administrator determines it 
        to be relevant, nitrogen oxide emissions) within the area do 
        not make a significant contribution to the ozone concentrations 
        measured in the ozone nonattainment area or in other areas.
  (i) Reclassified Areas.--Each State containing an ozone nonattainment 
area reclassified under section 215202(b)(2) of this title shall meet 
such requirements of subsections (b) through (d) as may be applicable 
to the area as reclassified, according to the schedules prescribed in 
connection with those requirements, except that the Administrator may 
adjust any applicable deadlines (other than attainment dates) to the 
extent that an adjustment is necessary or appropriate to ensure 
consistency among the required provisions.
  (j) Multi-state Ozone Nonattainment Areas.--
          (1) Definition of multi-state ozone nonattainment area.--In 
        this subsection, the term ``multi-State ozone nonattainment 
        area'' means a single ozone nonattainment area that is located 
        in more than 1 State.
          (2) Coordination among states.--
                  (A) In general.--Each State in which there is located 
                a portion of a single ozone nonattainment area shall--
                          (i) take all reasonable steps to coordinate, 
                        substantively and procedurally, the provisions 
                        and implementation of State implementation 
                        plans applicable to the nonattainment area 
                        concerned; and
                          (ii) use photochemical grid modeling or any 
                        other analytical method determined by the 
                        Administrator, in the Administrator's 
                        discretion, to be at least as effective.
                  (B) No plan provision approval absent compliance.--
                The Administrator may not approve any provision of a 
                State implementation plan submitted under this 
                subchapter for a State in which part of a multi-State 
                ozone nonattainment area is located if the plan 
                revision fails to comply with this paragraph.
          (3) Failure to demonstrate attainment.--If any State in which 
        there is located a portion of a multi-State ozone nonattainment 
        area fails to provide a demonstration of attainment of the 
        NAAQS for ozone in that portion within the required period, the 
        State may petition the Administrator to make a finding that the 
        State would have been able to make such a demonstration but for 
        the failure of 1 or more other States in which other portions 
        of the multi-State ozone nonattainment area are located to 
        commit to the implementation of all measures required under 
        this section. If the Administrator makes such a finding, 
        section 215111 of this title shall not apply, by reason of the 
        failure to make such a demonstration, in the portion of the 
        multi-State ozone nonattainment area within the State 
        submitting the petition.
Sec. 215204. Federal ozone measures
  (a) Control Technique Guidelines for Volatile Organic Compound 
Sources.--The Administrator shall issue control technique guidelines, 
in accordance with section 211108 of this title, for 11 categories of 
stationary sources of volatile organic compound emissions for which 
control technique guidelines had not been issued as of November 15, 
1990, not including the categories described in paragraphs (3) and (4) 
of subsection (b). The Administrator may issue such additional control 
technique guidelines as the Administrator considers necessary.
  (b) Existing and New Control Technique Guidelines.--
          (1) Review and updating.--The Administrator shall 
        periodically review and, if necessary, update control technique 
        guidelines issued under section 108 of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7408) before November 15, 1990.
          (2) Priority.--In issuing the control technique guidelines 
        the Administrator shall give priority to categories that the 
        Administrator considers to make the most significant 
        contribution to the formation of ozone air pollution in ozone 
        nonattainment areas, including hazardous waste treatment, 
        storage, and disposal facilities that are permitted under 
        subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6921 et 
        seq.). The Administrator shall periodically review and, if 
        necessary, revise the control technique guidelines.
          (3) Aerospace coatings and solvents.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall issue 
                control technique guidelines in accordance with section 
                211108 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions 
                of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from 
                aerospace coatings and solvents. The control technique 
                guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce 
                aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into 
                the ambient air from the application of aerospace 
                coatings and solvents to such level as the 
                Administrator determines may be achieved through the 
                adoption of best available control measures. The 
                control technique guidelines shall provide for such 
                reductions in such increments and on such schedules as 
                the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in 
                no event later than 10 years after the final issuance 
                of the control technique guidelines.
                  (B) Consultation.--In developing control technique 
                guidelines under this paragraph, the Administrator 
                shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the 
                Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of 
                the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with 
                regard to the establishment of specifications for 
                aerospace coatings.
                  (C) Considerations.--In evaluating volatile organic 
                compound reduction strategies, the guidance shall take 
                into account--
                          (i) the applicable requirements of section 
                        211112 of this title; and
                          (ii) the need to protect stratospheric ozone.
          (4) Shipbuilding and ship repair paints, coatings, and 
        solvents.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall issue 
                control technique guidelines in accordance with section 
                211108 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions 
                of volatile organic compounds and PM-10 into the 
                ambient air from paints, coatings, and solvents used in 
                shipbuilding operations and ship repair. The control 
                technique guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate 
                to reduce aggregate emissions of volatile organic 
                compounds and PM-10 into the ambient air from the 
                removal or application of such paints, coatings, and 
                solvents to such level as the Administrator determines 
                may be achieved through the adoption of the best 
                available control measures. The control technique 
                guidelines shall provide for such reductions in such 
                increments and on such schedules as the Administrator 
                determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 
                10 years after the final issuance of the control 
                technique guidelines.
                  (B) Consultation.--In developing control technique 
                guidelines under this paragraph, the Administrator 
                shall consult with the appropriate Federal agencies.
  (c) Alternative Control Techniques.--The Administrator shall issue 
technical documents that identify alternative controls for all 
categories of stationary sources of volatile organic compounds and 
nitrogen oxides that emit, or have the potential to emit, 25 or more 
tons per year of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. The 
Administrator shall revise and update the documents as the 
Administrator determines to be necessary.
  (d) Guidance for Evaluating Cost-Effectiveness.--The Administrator 
shall provide guidance to the States to be used in evaluating the 
relative cost-effectiveness of various options for the control of 
emissions from existing stationary sources of air pollutants that 
contribute to nonattainment of the NAAQSes for ozone.
  (e) Control of Emissions From Certain Sources.--
          (1) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                  (A) Best available controls.--The term ``best 
                available controls'' means the degree of emission 
                reduction that the Administrator determines, on the 
                basis of technological and economic feasibility, 
                health, environmental, and energy impacts, is 
                achievable through the application of the most 
                effective equipment, measures, processes, methods, 
                systems, or techniques, including chemical 
                reformulation, product or feedstock substitution, 
                repackaging, and directions for use, consumption, 
                storage, or disposal.
                  (B) Consumer or commercial product.--
                          (i) In general.--The term ``consumer or 
                        commercial product'' means any substance, 
                        product (including paints, coatings, and 
                        solvents), or article (including any container 
                        or packaging) held by any person, the use, 
                        consumption, storage, disposal, destruction, or 
                        decomposition of which may result in the 
                        release of volatile organic compounds.
                          (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``consumer or 
                        commercial product'' does not include--
                                  (I) a fuel or fuel additive regulated 
                                under section 221111 of this title; or

                        distributor, or importer of consumer or 
                        commercial products for sale or distribution in 
                        interstate commerce; or
                          (ii) a manufacturer, processor, wholesale 
                        distributor, or importer that supplies entities 
                        described in clause (i) with consumer or 
                        commercial products for sale or distribution in 
                        interstate commerce.
          (2) Study and report.--
                  (A) Study.--The Administrator shall conduct a study 
                of and submit to Congress a report on the emissions of 
                volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from 
                consumer and commercial products (or any combination 
                thereof) to--
                          (i) determine their potential to contribute 
                        to ozone levels that violate the NAAQS for 
                        ozone; and
                          (ii) establish criteria for regulating 
                        consumer and commercial products or classes or 
                        categories thereof that shall be subject to 
                        control under this subsection.
                  (B) Consideration of certain factors.--In 
                establishing the criteria under subparagraph (A)(ii), 
                the Administrator shall take into consideration each of 
                the following:
                          (i) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand 
                        of consumer and commercial products.
                          (ii) The health or safety functions (if any) 
                        served by consumer and commercial products.
                          (iii) Consumer and commercial products that 
                        emit highly reactive volatile organic compounds 
                        into the ambient air.
                          (iv) Consumer and commercial products that 
                        are subject to the most cost-effective 
                        controls.
                          (v) The availability of alternatives (if any) 
                        to consumer and commercial products that are of 
                        comparable costs, considering health, safety, 
                        and environmental impacts.
          (3) Regulations to require emission reductions.--
                  (A) In general.--On submission of the report under 
                paragraph (2), the Administrator shall list the 
                categories of consumer or commercial products that the 
                Administrator determines, based on the study, account 
                for at least 80 percent of the volatile organic 
                compound emissions, on a reactivity-adjusted basis, 
                from consumer or commercial products in areas that 
                violate the NAAQSes for ozone. Credit toward the 80 
                percent emissions calculation shall be given for 
                emission reductions from consumer or commercial 
                products made after November 15, 1990. The 
                Administrator shall divide the list into 4 groups and 
                promulgate regulations for all 4 groups.
                  (B) Best available controls.--The regulations shall 
                require best available controls.
                  (C) Health use products.--The regulations may exempt 
                health use products for which the Administrator 
                determines there is no suitable substitute.
                  (D) Control or prohibition of activity.--To carry out 
                this section, the Administrator may, by regulation, 
                control or prohibit any activity (including the 
                manufacture or introduction into commerce, offering for 
                sale, or sale of any consumer or commercial product) 
                that results in emission of volatile organic compounds 
                into the ambient air.
                  (E) Regulated entities.--Regulations under this 
                subsection may be imposed only with respect to 
                regulated entities.
                  (F) Use of control technique guidelines.--For any 
                consumer or commercial product, the Administrator may 
                issue control technique guidelines under this division 
                in lieu of regulations required under subparagraph (A) 
                if the Administrator determines that control technique 
                guidelines will be substantially as effective as 
                regulations in reducing emissions of volatile organic 
                compounds that contribute to ozone levels in areas that 
                violate the NAAQS for ozone.
          (4) Systems of regulation.--The regulations under this 
        subsection may include any system or systems of regulation as 
        the Administrator considers appropriate, including requirements 
        for registration and labeling, self-monitoring and reporting, 
        prohibitions, limitations, or economic incentives (including 
        marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights) concerning 
        the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, consumption, or 
        disposal of a consumer or commercial product.
          (5) Special fund.--Any amounts collected by the Administrator 
        under the regulations shall be deposited in the Treasury in a 
        special fund for licensing and other services, which thereafter 
        shall be available until expended, subject to annual 
        appropriation Acts, solely to carry out the activities of the 
        Administrator for which such fees, charges, or collections are 
        established or made.
          (6) Enforcement.--Any regulation established under this 
        subsection shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of 
        this division, as a standard under section 211111 of this 
        title, and any violation of such a regulation shall be treated 
        as a violation of a requirement of section 211111(j) of this 
        title.
          (7) State administration.--Each State may develop and submit 
        to the Administrator a procedure under State law for 
        implementing and enforcing regulations promulgated under this 
        subsection. If the Administrator finds that the State procedure 
        is adequate, the Administrator shall approve the procedure. 
        Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the Administrator from 
        enforcing any applicable regulation under this subsection.
          (8) Size, shape, and labeling.--No regulation regarding the 
        size, shape, or labeling of a consumer or commercial may be 
        promulgated, unless the Administrator determines such a 
        regulation to be useful in meeting any NAAQS.
          (9) State consultation.--Any State that proposes regulations 
        other than those adopted under this subsection shall consult 
        with the Administrator regarding whether any other State or 
        local subdivision has promulgated or is promulgating 
        regulations on any products covered under this chapter. The 
        Administrator shall establish a clearinghouse of information, 
        studies, and regulations proposed and promulgated regarding 
        consumer or commercial products and disseminate the information 
        collected as requested by State or local subdivisions.
  (f) Tank Vessel Standards.--
          (1) In general.--
                  (A) Standards.--The Administrator, in consultation 
                with the Secretary of the department in which the Coast 
                Guard is operating, shall promulgate standards 
                applicable to the emission of volatile organic 
                compounds and any other air pollutant from loading and 
                unloading of tank vessels (as defined in section 2101 
                of title 46) that the Administrator finds causes, or 
                contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably 
                anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The 
                standards shall require the application of reasonably 
                available control technology, considering costs, any 
                non-air-quality benefits, environmental impacts, energy 
                requirements, and safety factors associated with 
                alternative control techniques. To the extent 
                practicable, the standards shall apply to loading and 
                unloading facilities and not to tank vessels.
                  (B) Effective date.--Any regulation promulgated under 
                this subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take 
                effect after such period as the Administrator finds 
                (after consultation with the Secretary of the 
                department in which the Coast Guard is operating) 
                necessary to permit the development and application of 
                the requisite technology, giving appropriate 
                consideration to the cost of compliance within that 
                period, except that the effective date shall be not 
                more than 2 years after promulgation of the 
                regulations.
          (2) Regulations on equipment safety.--The Secretary of the 
        department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall issue 
        regulations to ensure the safety of the equipment and 
        operations that are to control emissions from the loading and 
        unloading of tank vessels under section 3703 of title 46 and 
        section 6 of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. 
        1225). The standards promulgated by the Administrator under 
        paragraph (1) and the regulations issued by a State or 
        political subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and 
        unloading of tank vessels shall be consistent with the 
        regulations regarding safety of the department in which the 
        Coast Guard is operating.
          (3) Agency authority.--
                  (A) Emission standards.--The Administrator shall 
                ensure compliance with the tank vessel emission 
                standards promulgated under paragraph (1)(A). The 
                Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is 
                operating shall ensure compliance with the tank vessel 
                standards promulgated under paragraph (1)(A).
                  (B) Safety regulations.--The Secretary of the 
                department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall 
                ensure compliance with the regulations issued under 
                paragraph (2).
          (4) State or local standards.--After the Administrator 
        promulgates standards under this section, no State or political 
        subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any 
        standard respecting emissions from tank vessels subject to 
        regulation under paragraph (1) unless the State or local 
        standard is no less stringent than the standards promulgated 
        under paragraph (1).
          (5) Enforcement.--Any standard established under paragraph 
        (1)(A) shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of this 
        division, as a standard under section 211111 of this title, and 
        any violation of such a standard shall be treated as a 
        violation of a requirement of section 211111(j) of this title.
  (g) Vehicles Entering Ozone Nonattainment Areas.--
          (1) Definition of covered ozone nonattainment area.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``covered ozone nonattainment area'' means 
        a serious area, as classified under section 181 of the Clean 
        Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511) as of October 27, 1998.
          (2) Authority regarding ozone inspection and maintenance 
        testing.--
                  (A) In general.--No noncommercial motor vehicle 
                registered in a foreign country and operated by a 
                United States citizen or by an alien who is a permanent 
                resident of the United States, or who holds a visa for 
                the purposes of employment or educational study in the 
                United States, may enter a covered ozone nonattainment 
                area from a foreign country bordering the United States 
                and contiguous to the nonattainment area more than 
                twice in a single calendar-month period, if State law 
                has requirements for the inspection and maintenance of 
                noncommercial motor vehicles under the applicable 
                implementation plan in the nonattainment area.
                  (B) Applicability.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply 
                if the operator presents documentation at the United 
                States border entry point establishing that the vehicle 
                has complied with such inspection and maintenance 
                requirements as are in effect and are applicable to 
                motor vehicles of the same type and model year.
          (3) Sanctions for violations.--The President may impose and 
        collect from the operator of any motor vehicle who violates, or 
        attempts to violate, paragraph (1) a civil penalty of not more 
        than $200 for the 2d violation or attempted violation and $400 
        for the 3d and each subsequent violation or attempted 
        violation.
          (4) State election.--The prohibition set forth in paragraph 
        (1) shall not apply in any State that elects to be exempt from 
        the prohibition. Such an election shall take effect on the 
        President's receipt of written notice from the Governor of the 
        State notifying the President of the election.
          (5) Alternative approach.--The prohibition set forth in 
        paragraph (1) shall not apply in a State, and the President may 
        implement an alternative approach, if--
                  (A) the Governor of the State submits to the 
                President a written description of an alternative 
                approach to facilitate the compliance, by some or all 
                foreign-registered motor vehicles, with the motor 
                vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements that 
                are--
                          (i) related to emissions of air pollutants;
                          (ii) in effect under the applicable 
                        implementation plan in the covered ozone 
                        nonattainment area; and
                          (iii) applicable to motor vehicles of the 
                        same types and model years as the foreign-
                        registered motor vehicles; and
                  (B) the President approves the alternative approach 
                as facilitating compliance with the motor vehicle 
                inspection and maintenance requirements described in 
                subparagraph (A).
Sec. 215205. Control of interstate ozone air pollution
  (a) Ozone Transport Regions.--
          (1) In general.--There is established a single interstate 
        transport region for ozone (within the meaning of section 
        215108(a) of this title), comprised of the States of 
        Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New 
        Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
        Vermont, and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area 
        that includes the District of Columbia.
          (2) Addition and removal of states.--The Administrator, on 
        the Administrator's own motion, on petition from the Governor 
        of any State, or on the recommendation of the interstate 
        transport commission established by paragraph (1) or the 
        interstate transport commission established for any other 
        interstate transport region for ozone, may--
                  (A) add any State or portion of a State to an 
                interstate transport region established under paragraph 
                (1) or other interstate transport region for ozone when 
                the Administrator has reason to believe that the 
                interstate transport of air pollutants from that State 
                significantly contributes to a violation of the NAAQS 
                for ozone in the interstate transport region; or
                  (B) remove any State or portion of a State from an 
                interstate transport region when the Administrator has 
                reason to believe that the control of emissions in that 
                State or portion of the State pursuant to this section 
                will not significantly contribute to the attainment of 
                the NAAQS for ozone in any area in the interstate 
                transport region.
          (3) Procedure.--
                  (A) Approval or disapproval.--The Administrator shall 
                approve or disapprove a petition or recommendation 
                under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) within 
                18 months after its receipt.
                  (B) Public participation.--The Administrator shall 
                establish appropriate proceedings for public 
                participation regarding motions, petitions, and 
                recommendations under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
                paragraph (2), including notice and comment.
          (4) Convening of commission.--The Administrator shall convene 
        the commission required under section 215108(b) of this title 
        as a result of the establishment of the interstate transport 
        region.
  (b) Plan Provisions for States in Interstate Transport Regions for 
Ozone.--
          (1) In general.--In accordance with section 211110 of this 
        title, not later than 9 months after the inclusion of a State 
        in an interstate transport region for ozone, each State 
        included in the interstate transport region shall submit to the 
        Administrator a State implementation plan provision that--
                  (A) requires that each area in the State that is a 
                metropolitan statistical area or is part of a 
                metropolitan statistical area with a population of 
                100,000 or more comply with section 215203(c)(4)(B) of 
                this title; and
                  (B) requires implementation of reasonably available 
                control technology with respect to all sources of 
                volatile organic compounds in the State covered by a 
                control technique guideline.
          (2) Control measures.--The Administrator shall complete a 
        study identifying control measures capable of achieving 
        emission reductions comparable to those achievable through 
        vehicle refueling controls contained in section 215203(b)(4) of 
        this title, and those measures or vehicle refueling controls 
        shall be implemented in accordance with this section. 
        Notwithstanding other deadlines in this section, the applicable 
        implementation plan shall be revised to reflect those measures 
        within 1 year of completion of the study. For purposes of this 
        section, any stationary source that emits or has the potential 
        to emit at least 50 tons per year of volatile organic compounds 
        shall be considered a major stationary source and subject to 
        the requirements that would be applicable to major stationary 
        sources if the area were classified as a moderate area.
  (c) Additional Control Measures.--
          (1) Definition of receipt date.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``receipt date'' means the date on which the Administrator 
        receives recommendations prepared by a commission pursuant to 
        paragraph (2).
          (2) Recommendations.--On petition of any State within a 
        transport region established for ozone, and based on a majority 
        vote of the Governors on the commission (or their designees), 
        the commission may, after notice and opportunity for public 
        comment, develop recommendations for additional control 
        measures to be applied within all or a part of the ozone 
        transport region if the commission determines that such 
        measures are necessary to bring any area in the ozone transport 
        region into attainment by the dates provided by this 
        subchapter. The commission shall transmit the recommendations 
        to the Administrator.
          (3) Notice and review.--When the Administrator receives 
        recommendations prepared by a commission pursuant to paragraph 
        (2), the Administrator shall--
                  (A) immediately publish in the Federal Register a 
                notice stating that the recommendations are available 
                and provide an opportunity for public hearing within 90 
                days beginning on the receipt date; and
                  (B) commence a review of the recommendations to 
                determine whether the control measures in the 
                recommendations are necessary to bring any area in the 
                ozone transport region into attainment by the dates 
                provided by this subchapter and are otherwise 
                consistent with this division.
          (4) Consultation; considerations.--In undertaking the review 
        required under paragraph (3)(B), the Administrator shall--
                  (A) consult with members of the commission of the 
                affected States; and
                  (B) take into account the data, views, and comments 
                received pursuant to paragraph (3)(A).
          (5) Approval and disapproval.--
                  (A) In general.--Within 9 months after the receipt 
                date, the Administrator shall--
                          (i) determine whether to approve, disapprove, 
                        or partially disapprove and partially approve 
                        the recommendations;
                          (ii) notify the commission in writing of the 
                        approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval; 
                        and
                          (iii) publish the determination in the 
                        Federal Register.
                  (B) Disapproval or partial disapproval.--If the 
                Administrator disapproves or partially disapproves the 
                recommendations, the Administrator shall specify--
                          (i) why any disapproved additional control 
                        measures are not necessary to bring any area in 
                        the ozone transport region into attainment by 
                        the dates provided by this or are otherwise not 
                        consistent with this division; and
                          (ii) recommendations concerning equal or more 
                        effective actions that could be taken by the 
                        commission to conform the disapproved portion 
                        of the recommendations to the requirements of 
                        this section.
          (6) Finding.--On approval or partial approval of 
        recommendations submitted by a commission, the Administrator 
        shall issue to each State that is included in the ozone 
        transport region and to which a requirement of the approved 
        plan applies a finding under section 211110(i)(5) of this title 
        that the implementation plan for that State is inadequate to 
        meet the requirements of section 211110(a)(3)(D) of this title. 
        The finding shall require each such State to revise its 
        implementation plan to include the approved additional control 
        measures within 1 year after the finding is issued.
  (d) Best Available Air Quality Monitoring and Modeling.--For purposes 
of this section, the Administrator shall promulgate criteria for 
purposes of determining the contribution of sources in 1 area to 
concentrations of ozone in another area that is a nonattainment area 
for ozone. The criteria shall require that the best available air 
quality monitoring and modeling techniques be used for purposes of 
making such determinations.
Sec. 215206. Enforcement for severe areas and extreme areas for failure 
                    to attain
  (a) General Rule.--Each implementation plan provision required under 
subsections (d) and (e) of section 215203 of this title shall provide 
that, if the severe area or extreme area to which the plan provision 
applies has failed to attain the primary NAAQS for ozone by the 
applicable attainment date, each major stationary source of volatile 
organic compounds located in the severe area or extreme area shall, 
except as otherwise provided under subsection (c), pay a fee to the 
State as a penalty for the failure, computed in accordance with 
subsection (b), for each calendar year beginning after the attainment 
date, until the severe area or extreme area is redesignated as an 
attainment area for ozone. Each such plan provision should include 
procedures for assessment and collection of such fees.
  (b) Computation of Fee.--
          (1) Fee amount.--The fee shall equal $5,000, adjusted in 
        accordance with paragraph (3), per ton of volatile organic 
        compound emitted by the source during the calendar year in 
        excess of 80 percent of the baseline amount, computed under 
        paragraph (2).
          (2) Baseline amount.--
                  (A) In general.--For purposes of this section, the 
                baseline amount shall be computed, in accordance with 
                such guidance as the Administrator may provide, as the 
                lower, during the attainment year, of--
                          (i) the amount of actual volatile organic 
                        compound emissions (referred to in this 
                        paragraph as ``actuals''); or
                          (ii) the amount of volatile organic compound 
                        emissions allowed under the permit applicable 
                        to the source (or, if no such permit has been 
                        issued for the attainment year, the amount of 
                        volatile organic compound emissions allowed 
                        under the applicable implementation plan) 
                        (referred to in this paragraph as 
                        ``allowables'').
                  (B) Period of determination.--Notwithstanding 
                subparagraph (A), the Administrator may issue guidance 
                authorizing the baseline amount to be determined in 
                accordance with the lower of average actuals or average 
                allowables, determined over a period of more than 1 
                calendar year. The guidance may provide that such an 
                average calculation for a specific source may be used 
                if that source's emissions are irregular, cyclical, or 
                otherwise vary significantly from year to year.
          (3) Annual adjustment.--The fee amount under paragraph (1) 
        shall be adjusted annually, beginning as of 1991, in accordance 
        with section 235102(b)(3)(B)(iv) of this title.
  (c) Exception.--Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no 
source shall be required to pay any fee under subsection (a) with 
respect to emissions during any year that is treated as an extension 
year under section 215202(a)(5) of this title.
  (d) Fee Collection by Administrator.--If the Administrator has found 
that the fee provisions of the implementation plan do not meet the 
requirements of this section, or if the Administrator makes a finding 
that the State is not administering and enforcing the fee required 
under this section, the Administrator shall, in addition to any other 
action authorized under this subdivision, collect, in accordance with 
procedures promulgated by the Administrator, the unpaid fees required 
under subsection (a). If the Administrator makes such a finding under 
section 215111(a)(1)(D) of this title, the Administrator may collect 
fees for periods before the determination, plus interest computed in 
accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)), to the extent that the Administrator finds that 
such fees have not been paid to the State. Clauses (ii) through (iii) 
of section 235102(b)(3)(C) of this title shall apply with respect to 
fees collected under this subsection.
  (e) Exemptions for Certain Small Areas.--For a severe area or extreme 
area with a total population under 200,000 that fails to attain the 
standard by the applicable attainment date, no sanction under this 
section or under any other provision of this division shall apply if 
the severe area or extreme area can demonstrate, consistent with 
guidance issued by the Administrator, that attainment in the severe 
area or extreme area is prevented because of ozone or ozone precursors 
transported from another area. The prohibition applies only in a case 
in which the severe area or extreme area has met all requirements and 
implemented all measures applicable to the severe area or extreme area 
under this division.
Sec. 215207. Nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound study
  (a) In General.--The Administrator, in conjunction with the National 
Academy of Sciences, shall conduct a study on the role of ozone 
precursors in tropospheric ozone formation and control.
  (b) Matters To Be Examined.--The study shall examine--
          (1) the roles of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound 
        emission reductions;
          (2) the extent to which nitrogen oxide reductions may 
        contribute (or be counterproductive) to achievement of 
        attainment in different nonattainment areas;
          (3) the sensitivity of ozone to the control of nitrogen 
        oxides;
          (4) the availability and extent of controls for nitrogen 
        oxides;
          (5) the role of biogenic volatile organic compound emissions; 
        and
          (6) the basic information required for air quality models.
  (c) Information and Studies; Additional Information.--The 
Administrator shall utilize all available information and studies and 
develop additional information in conducting the study required by this 
section.
  (d) Report.--The Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on 
the study.

Subchapter III--Additional Provisions for Carbon Monoxide Nonattainment 
                                 Areas

Sec. 215301. Definitions
  In this subchapter:
          (1) Moderate area.--The term ``moderate area'' means an area 
        that is classified as a moderate area under section 215302 of 
        this title.
          (2) Serious area.--The term ``serious area'' means an area 
        that is classified as a serious area under section 215302 of 
        this title.
          (3) Table 1.--The term ``table 1'' means table 1 in section 
        215302(a)(1) of this title.
Sec. 215302. Classification and attainment dates
  (a) Classification by Operation of Law and Attainment Dates for 
Nonattainment Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each area designated nonattainment for 
        carbon monoxide pursuant to section 211107(d) of this title 
        shall be classified at the time of designation under table 1, 
        by operation of law, as a moderate area or serious area based 
        on the design value for the area. The design value shall be 
        calculated according to the interpretation methodology issued 
        by the Administrator most recently before November 15, 1990. 
        For each area classified under this subsection, the primary 
        NAAQS attainment date for carbon monoxide shall be as 
        expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date 
        provided in table 1:

                                                     TABLE 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Area  classification                       Design value             Primary standard attainment date
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moderate.................................  9.1-16.4 ppm.....................  December 31, 1995
Serious..................................  16.5 and above...................  December 31, 2000
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          (2) Notice.--At the time of publication of the notice 
        required under section 211107 of this title, the Administrator 
        shall publish a notice announcing the classification of each 
        such carbon monoxide nonattainment area. Section 
        215102(a)(1)(B) of this title shall apply with respect to such 
        a classification.
          (3) Adjustment.--
                  (A) In general.--If an area classified under 
                paragraph (1) would have been classified in another 
                category if the design value in the area were 5 percent 
                greater or 5 percent less than the level on which the 
                classification was based, the Administrator may, within 
                90 days after November 15, 1990, by the procedure 
                required under paragraph (2), adjust the classification 
                of the area.
                  (B) Considerations.--In making such an adjustment, 
                the Administrator may consider--
                          (i) the number of exceedances of the primary 
                        NAAQS for carbon monoxide in the area;
                          (ii) the level of pollution transport between 
                        the area and other affected areas; and
                          (iii) the mix of sources and air pollutants 
                        in the area.
          (4) Extension.--
                  (A) In general.--On application by any State, the 
                Administrator may extend for 1 additional year 
                (referred to in this paragraph as an ``extension 
                year'') the date specified in table 1 of subsection (a) 
                if--
                          (i) the State has complied with all 
                        requirements and commitments pertaining to the 
                        area in the applicable implementation plan; and
                          (ii) not more than 1 exceedance of the NAAQS 
                        level for carbon monoxide has occurred in the 
                        area in the year preceding the extension year.
                  (B) Limitation.--Not more than 2 one-year extensions 
                may be issued under this paragraph for a single 
                nonattainment area.
  (b) New Designations and Reclassifications.--
          (1) New designations to nonattainment.--Any area that is 
        designated attainment or unclassifiable for carbon monoxide 
        under section 211107(d)(4) of this title and is subsequently 
        redesignated to nonattainment for carbon monoxide under section 
        211107(d)(3) of this title shall, at the time of the 
        redesignation, be classified by operation of law in accordance 
        with table 1. Upon its classification, the area shall be 
        subject to the same requirements under section 211110 of this 
        title, subchapter I, and this subchapter that would have 
        applied had the area been so classified at the time of the 
        notice under subsection (a)(2), except that any absolute, fixed 
        date applicable in connection with any such requirement is 
        extended by operation of law by a period equal to the length of 
        time between November 15, 1990, and the date the area is 
        classified.
          (2) Reclassification of moderate areas on failure to 
        attain.--
                  (A) Determination.--Within 6 months after the 
                applicable attainment date for a carbon monoxide 
                nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine, 
                based on the area's design value as of the attainment 
                date, whether the area has attained the NAAQS by that 
                date.
                  (B) Reclassification.--Any moderate area that the 
                Administrator finds has not attained the NAAQS by that 
                date shall be reclassified by operation of law in 
                accordance with table 1 as a serious area.
                  (C) Notice.--The Administrator shall publish a notice 
                in the Federal Register, not later than 6 months after 
                the attainment date, identifying each area that the 
                Administrator has determined, under subparagraph (A), 
                as having failed to attain the NAAQS and identifying 
                the reclassification, if any, described under 
                subparagraph (B).
Sec. 215303. Plan submissions and requirements
  (a) Moderate Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of a 
        moderate area is located shall, with respect to the moderate 
        area (or portion thereof, to the extent specified in guidance 
        of the Administrator issued before November 15, 1990), submit 
        to the Administrator the State implementation plan provisions 
        (including the plan items) described under this subsection, 
        within such periods as are prescribed under this subsection, 
        except to the extent that the State has made such submissions 
        as of November 15, 1990.
          (2) Inventory.--A State shall submit a comprehensive, 
        accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all 
        sources, as described in section 215102(c)(3) of this title, in 
        accordance with guidance provided by the Administrator.
          (3) Vehicle miles traveled; special rule for denver.--
                  (A) Vehicle miles traveled.--For areas with a design 
                value above 12.7 parts per million at the time of 
                classification, the plan provision shall contain a 
                forecast of vehicle miles traveled in a nonattainment 
                area for each year before the year in which the plan 
                projects the NAAQS for carbon monoxide to be attained 
                in the area. The forecast shall be based on guidance 
                published by the Administrator, in consultation with 
                the Secretary of Transportation. The plan provision 
                shall provide for annual updates of the forecasts to be 
                submitted to the Administrator together with annual 
                reports regarding the extent to which the forecasts 
                proved to be accurate. The annual reports shall contain 
                estimates of actual vehicle miles traveled in each year 
                for which a forecast was required.
                  (B) Special rule for denver.--In the case of Denver, 
                the State shall submit a provision that includes the 
                transportation control measures as required in section 
                215203(d)(3)(A) of this title, except that the 
                provision shall be for the purpose of reducing carbon 
                monoxide emissions rather than volatile organic 
                compound emissions. If the State fails to include any 
                such measure, the implementation plan shall contain--
                          (i) an explanation why such a measure was not 
                        adopted and what emissions reduction measure 
                        was adopted to provide a comparable reduction 
                        in emissions; or
                          (ii) reasons why such a reduction is not 
                        necessary to attain the primary NAAQS for 
                        carbon monoxide.
                  (C) Adjustment.--The Administrator may make the same 
                adjustment for purposes of this paragraph as may be 
                made under section 215302(a)(3) of this title.
          (4) Contingency provisions.--
                  (A) In general.--For areas with a design value above 
                12.7 parts per million at the time of classification, 
                the plan provision shall provide for the implementation 
                of specific measures to be undertaken if--
                          (i) any estimate of vehicle miles traveled in 
                        the area that is submitted in an annual report 
                        under paragraph (3) exceeds the number 
                        predicted in the most recent prior forecast; or
                          (ii) if the area fails to attain the primary 
                        NAAQS for carbon monoxide by the primary 
                        standard attainment date.
                  (B) Inclusion in plan provision.--The measures shall 
                be included in the plan provision as contingency 
                measures to take effect without further action by the 
                State or the Administrator if--
                          (i) the prior forecast has been exceeded by 
                        an updated forecast; or
                          (ii) the national standard is not attained by 
                        that deadline.
                  (C) Adjustment.--The Administrator may make the same 
                adjustment for purposes of this paragraph as may be 
                made under section 215302(a)(3) of this title.
          (5) Savings clause for vehicle inspection and maintenance 
        provisions of the state implementation plan.--Immediately after 
        November 15, 1990, for any moderate area (or, within the 
        Administrator's discretion, portion thereof) the plan for which 
        is of the type described in section 215203(a)(3)(C) of this 
        title, the State shall submit any provisions necessary to 
        ensure that the applicable implementation plan includes the 
        vehicle inspection and maintenance program described in section 
        215203(a)(3)(C) of this title.
          (6) Periodic inventory.--Not later than the end of each 3-
        year period after September 30, 1995, until the area is 
        redesignated to attainment, the State shall submit a revised 
        inventory meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(1).
          (7) Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance.--
                  (A) In general.--In the case of moderate areas with a 
                design value greater than 12.7 parts per million at the 
                time of classification, the State shall submit a 
                provision that includes provisions for an enhanced 
                vehicle inspection and maintenance program as required 
                in section 215203(c)(5) of this title, except that the 
                vehicle inspection and maintenance program shall be for 
                the purpose of reducing carbon monoxide rather than 
                hydrocarbon emissions.
                  (B) Adjustment.--The Administrator may make the same 
                adjustment for purposes of this paragraph as may be 
                made under section 215302(a)(3) of this title.
          (8) Attainment demonstration and specific annual emission 
        reductions.--
                  (A) In general.--In the case of moderate areas with a 
                design value greater than 12.7 parts per million at the 
                time of classification, the State shall submit a 
                provision to provide, and a demonstration that the plan 
                as revised will provide, for attainment of the carbon 
                monoxide NAAQSes by the applicable attainment date and 
                provisions for such specific annual emission reductions 
                as are necessary to attain the standard by that date.
                  (B) Adjustment.--The Administrator may make the same 
                adjustment for purposes of this paragraph as may be 
                made under section 215302(a)(3) of this title.
          (9) Schedule.--The Administrator may require States to submit 
        a schedule for submitting any of the provisions or other items 
        required under this subsection.
          (10) Moderate areas with a design value of 12.7 parts per 
        million or lower.--In the case of a moderate area with a design 
        value of 12.7 parts per million or lower at the time of 
        classification, the requirements of this subsection shall apply 
        in lieu of any requirement that the State submit a 
        demonstration that the applicable implementation plan provides 
        for attainment of the carbon monoxide standard by the 
        applicable attainment date.
  (b) Serious Areas.--
          (1) In general.--Each State in which all or part of a serious 
        area is located shall, with respect to the serious area--
                  (A) make the submissions (other than those required 
                under subsection (a)(2)) applicable under subsection 
                (a) to moderate areas with a design value of 12.7 parts 
                per million or greater at the time of classification; 
                and
                  (B) submit the provision and other items described 
                under this subsection.
          (2) Vehicle miles traveled.--
                  (A) In general.--The State shall submit a provision 
                that includes the transportation control measures as 
                required in section 215203(d)(3) of this title, except 
                that the provision shall be for the purpose of reducing 
                carbon monoxide emissions rather than volatile organic 
                compound emissions.
                  (B) Clean fuel fleet program.--In the case of a 
                severe area (other than an area in New York State) that 
                is a covered area (as defined in section 
                225106(a)(1)(B) of this title) for purposes of the 
                clean fuel fleet program under chapter 225, if the 
                State fails to include a measure described in 
                subparagraph (A), the implementation plan shall 
                contain--
                          (i) an explanation why such a measure was not 
                        adopted and what emission reduction measure was 
                        adopted to provide a comparable reduction in 
                        emissions; or
                          (ii) reasons why such a reduction is not 
                        necessary to attain the primary NAAQS for 
                        carbon monoxide.
          (3) Oxygenated gasoline.--
                  (A) In general.--The State shall submit a provision 
                to require that gasoline sold, supplied, offered for 
                sale or supply, dispensed, transported, or introduced 
                into commerce in the larger of--
                          (i) the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical 
                        Area (as defined by the Office of Management 
                        and Budget) in which the area is located; or
                          (ii) if the area is not located in a 
                        Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, the 
                        Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by 
                        the Office of Management and Budget) in which 
                        the area is located;
                be blended, during the portion of the year in which the 
                area is prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon 
                monoxide (as determined by the Administrator), with 
                fuels containing such a level of oxygen as is 
                necessary, in combination with other measures, to 
                provide for attainment of the carbon monoxide NAAQS by 
                the applicable attainment date and maintenance of the 
                NAAQS thereafter in the area. The provision shall 
                include a program for implementation and enforcement of 
                the requirement consistent with guidance issued by the 
                Administrator.
                  (B) Provision not necessary.--Notwithstanding 
                subparagraph (A), the provision described in this 
                paragraph shall not be required for an area if the 
                State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                Administrator that the provision is not necessary to 
                provide for attainment of the carbon monoxide NAAQS by 
                the applicable attainment date and maintenance of the 
                NAAQS thereafter in the area.
  (c) Areas With Significant Stationary Source Emissions of Carbon 
Monoxide.--
          (1) Serious areas.--In the case of serious areas in which 
        stationary sources contribute significantly to carbon monoxide 
        levels (as determined under regulations issued by the 
        Administrator), the State shall submit a plan provision that 
        provides that the term ``major stationary source'' includes (in 
        addition to the sources described in section 201101 of this 
        title) any stationary source that emits, or has the potential 
        to emit, 50 tons per year or more of carbon monoxide.
          (2) Waivers for certain areas.--The Administrator may, on a 
        case-by-case basis, waive any requirements that pertain to 
        transportation controls, inspection and maintenance, or 
        oxygenated fuels where the Administrator determines by 
        regulation that mobile sources of carbon monoxide do not 
        contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels in the area.
          (3) Guidelines.--The Administrator shall issue guidelines for 
        and regulations determining whether stationary sources 
        contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels in an area.
  (d) Carbon Monoxide Milestone.--
          (1) Definition of milestone.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``milestone'' means a reduction in emissions of carbon monoxide 
        equivalent to the total of the specific annual emission 
        reductions required by December 31, 1995.
          (2) Milestone demonstration.--Each State in which all or part 
        of a serious area is located shall submit to the Administrator 
        a demonstration that the area has achieved the milestone.
          (3) Adequacy of demonstration.--A demonstration under this 
        paragraph shall be submitted in such form and manner, and shall 
        contain such information and analysis, as the Administrator 
        shall require. The Administrator shall determine whether or not 
        a State's demonstration is adequate within 90 days after the 
        Administrator's receipt of a demonstration that contains the 
        information and analysis required by the Administrator.
          (4) Failure to submit demonstration or to meet milestone.--If 
        a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (2) 
        within the required period, or if the Administrator notifies 
        the State that the State has not met the milestone, the State 
        shall, within 9 months after such a failure or notification, 
        submit a plan revision to implement an economic incentive and 
        transportation control program as described in section 
        215203(g)(4) of this title. The revision shall be sufficient to 
        achieve the specific annual reductions in carbon monoxide 
        emissions set forth in the plan by the attainment date.
  (e) Multi-State Carbon Monoxide Nonattainment Areas.--
          (1) Definition of multi-state carbon monoxide nonattainment 
        area.--In this subsection, the term ``multi-State carbon 
        monoxide nonattainment area'' means a single carbon monoxide 
        nonattainment area that is located in more than 1 State.
          (2) Coordination among states.--
                  (A) In general.--A State in which there is located a 
                portion of a multi-State carbon monoxide nonattainment 
                area shall take all reasonable steps to coordinate, 
                substantively and procedurally, the provisions and 
                implementation of State implementation plans applicable 
                to the multi-State carbon monoxide nonattainment area.
                  (B) No plan provision approval absent compliance.--
                The Administrator shall not approve any provision of a 
                State implementation plan submitted under this chapter 
                for a State in which part of a volatile organic 
                compound located if the plan provision for that State 
                fails to comply with the requirements of this 
                paragraph.
          (3) Failure to demonstrate attainment.--If any State in which 
        there is located a portion of a multi-State carbon monoxide 
        nonattainment area fails to provide a demonstration of 
        attainment of the NAAQS for carbon monoxide in that portion 
        within the period required under this chapter, the State may 
        petition the Administrator to make a finding that the State 
        would have been able to make such a demonstration but for the 
        failure of 1 or more other States in which other portions of 
        the multi-State carbon monoxide nonattainment area are located 
        to commit to the implementation of all measures required under 
        this section. If the Administrator makes such a finding, in the 
        portion of the multi-State carbon monoxide nonattainment area 
        within the State submitting the petition, no sanction shall be 
        imposed under section 215111 of this title or under any other 
        provision of this division by reason of the failure to make 
        such a demonstration.
  (f) Reclassified Areas.--Each State containing a carbon monoxide 
nonattainment area reclassified under section 215302(b)(2) of this 
title shall meet the requirements of subsection (b), as may be 
applicable to the area as reclassified, according to the schedules 
prescribed in connection with those requirements, except that the 
Administrator may adjust any applicable deadlines (other than the 
attainment date) where such deadlines are shown to be infeasible.
  (g) Failure of Serious Area To Attain Standard.--If the Administrator 
determines under section 215302(b)(2) of this title that the primary 
NAAQS for carbon monoxide has not been attained in a serious area by 
the applicable attainment date, the State shall submit a plan revision 
for the area within 9 months after the date of the determination. The 
plan revision shall provide that a program of incentives and 
requirements as described in section 215203(g)(4) of this title shall 
be applicable in the area, and the program, in combination with other 
elements of the revised plan, shall be adequate to reduce the total 
tonnage of emissions of carbon monoxide in the area by at least 5 
percent per year in each year after approval of the plan revision and 
before attainment of the primary NAAQS for carbon monoxide.

      Subchapter IV--Additional Provisions for Particulate Matter 
                          Nonattainment Areas

Sec. 215401. Definitions
  In this subchapter:
          (1) Moderate area.--The term ``moderate area'' means an area

        that is reclassified as a serious PM-10 nonattainment area 
        under section 215402(b) of this title.
Sec. 215402. Classifications and attainment dates
  (a) Initial Classifications.--
          (1) In general.--Every area designated nonattainment for PM-
        10 pursuant to section 211107(d) of this title shall be 
        classified at the time of such designation, by operation of 
        law, as a moderate PM-10 nonattainment area at the time of the 
        designation.
          (2) Notice.--At the time of publication of the notice under 
        section 211107(d)(4) of this title for each PM-10 nonattainment 
        area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the 
        classification of such area. Section 215102(a)(1)(B) of this 
        title shall apply with respect to such a classification.
  (b) Reclassification as a Serious Area.--
          (1) Reclassification before attainment date.--The 
        Administrator may reclassify as a serious PM-10 nonattainment 
        area any area that the Administrator determines cannot 
        practicably attain the NAAQS for PM-10 by the attainment date 
        (as prescribed in subsection (c)) for moderate areas.
          (2) Reclassification on failure to attain.--Within 6 months 
        following the applicable attainment date for a PM-10 
        nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine whether 
        the area attained the standard by that date. If the 
        Administrator finds that any moderate area is not in attainment 
        after the applicable attainment date--
                  (A) the area shall be reclassified by operation of 
                law as a serious area; and
                  (B) the Administrator shall publish a notice in the 
                Federal Register not later than 6 months following the 
                attainment date, identifying the area as having failed 
                to attain and identifying the reclassification 
                described under subparagraph (A).
  (c) Attainment Dates.--Except as provided under subsection (d), the 
attainment dates for PM-10 nonattainment areas shall be as follows:
          (1) Moderate areas.--For a moderate area, the attainment date 
        shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the 
        end of the 6th calendar year after the area's designation as 
        nonattainment, except that, for areas designated nonattainment 
        for PM-10 under section 211107(d)(4) of this title, the 
        attainment date shall not extend beyond December 31, 1994.
          (2) Serious areas.--For a serious area, the attainment date 
        shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the 
        end of the 10th calendar year beginning after the area's 
        designation as nonattainment, except that, for areas designated 
        nonattainment for PM-10 under section 211107(d)(4) of this 
        title, the date shall not extend beyond December 31, 2001.
  (d) Extension of Attainment Date for Moderate Areas.--
          (1) In general.--On application by any State, the 
        Administrator may extend for 1 additional year (referred to in 
        this subsection as an ``extension year'') the date specified in 
        subsection (c)(1) if--
                  (A) the State has complied with all requirements and 
                commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable 
                implementation plan; and
                  (B) not more than 1 exceedance of the 24-hour NAAQS 
                level for PM-10 has occurred in the area in the year 
                preceding the extension year, and the annual mean 
                concentration of PM-10 in the area for the extension 
                year is less than or equal to the standard level.
          (2) Limitation.--Not more than 2 one-year extensions may be 
        issued under this subsection for a single nonattainment area.
  (e) Extension of Attainment Date for Serious Areas.--
          (1) In general.--On application by any State, the 
        Administrator may extend the attainment date for a serious area 
        beyond the date specified under subsection (c) if--
                  (A) attainment by the date established under 
                subsection (c) would be impracticable;
                  (B) the State has complied with all requirements and 
                commitments pertaining to the serious area in the 
                implementation plan; and
                  (C) the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the 
                Administrator that the plan for the serious area 
                includes the most stringent measures that--
                          (i) are included in the implementation plan 
                        of any State or are achieved in practice in any 
                        State; and
                          (ii) can feasibly be implemented in the 
                        serious area.
          (2) Plan provision.--At the time of an application under 
        paragraph (1), the State shall submit an implementation plan 
        provision that includes a demonstration of attainment by the 
        most expeditious alternative date practicable.
          (3) Considerations.--In determining whether to grant an 
        extension, and the appropriate length of time for any such 
        extension, the Administrator may consider--
                  (A) the nature and extent of nonattainment;
                  (B) the types and numbers of sources or other 
                emitting activities in the serious area (including the 
                influence of uncontrollable natural sources and 
                transboundary emissions from foreign countries);
                  (C) the population exposed to concentrations in 
                excess of the standard;
                  (D) the presence and concentration of potentially 
                toxic substances in the mix of particulate emissions in 
                the area; and
                  (E) the technological and economic feasibility of 
                various control measures.
          (4) Attainment demonstration.--The Administrator may not 
        approve an extension until the State submits an attainment 
        demonstration for the area.
          (5) Limitation.--The Administrator may grant not more than 1 
        extension for a serious area, of not more than 5 years.
  (f) Waivers for Certain Serious Areas.--The Administrator may, on a 
case-by-case basis, waive any requirement applicable to any serious 
area under this subchapter where the Administrator determines that 
anthropogenic sources of PM-10 do not contribute significantly to the 
violation of the PM-10 standard in the area. The Administrator may also 
waive a specific date for attainment of the standard where the 
Administrator determines that nonanthropogenic sources of PM-10

        the applicable date.
          (2) Demonstration.--Not later than 90 days after the date on 
        which a milestone applicable to the area occurs, each State in 
        which all or part of the serious area is located shall submit 
        to the Administrator a demonstration that all measures in the 
        plan approved under this section have been implemented and that 
        the milestone has been met. A demonstration under this 
        subsection shall be submitted in such form and manner, and 
        shall contain such information and analysis, as the 
        Administrator shall require. The Administrator shall determine 
        whether or not a State's demonstration under this subsection is

        demonstration that contains the information and analysis 
        required by the Administrator.
          (3) Failure to submit demonstration or to meet milestone.--If 
        a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (2) 
        with respect to a milestone within the required period or if 
        the Administrator determines that the area has not met any 
        milestone, the Administrator shall require the State, within 9 
        months after the failure or determination, to submit a plan 
        provision that ensures that the State will achieve the next 
        milestone (or attain the NAAQS for PM-10, if there is no next 
        milestone) by the applicable date.
  (d) Failure To Attain.--In the case of a serious area in which the 
NAAQS for PM-10 is not attained by the applicable attainment date, the 
State in which the serious area is located shall, after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, submit within 12 months after the 
applicable attainment date, plan provisions that provide for--
          (1) attainment of the NAAQS for PM-10; and
          (2) an annual reduction in PM-10 or PM-10 precursor emissions 
        within the area, from the date of the submission until 
        attainment, of not less than 5 percent of the amount of PM-10 
        or PM-10 precursor emissions as reported in the most recent 
        inventory prepared for the serious area.
  (e) PM-10 Precursors.--
          (1) In general.--The control requirements applicable under 
        plans in effect under this chapter for major stationary sources 
        of PM-10 shall apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 
        precursors, except where the Administrator determines that 
        major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors do not contribute 
        significantly to PM-10 levels that exceed the NAAQS in the 
        serious area.
          (2) Guidelines.--The Administrator shall issue guidelines 
        regarding the application of paragraph (1).
Sec. 215404. Issuance of RACM and BACM guidance
  (a) In General.--The Administrator shall issue, in the same manner

          (2) emissions from residential wood combustion (including 
        curtailments and exemptions from curtailments) and prescribed 
        silvicultural and agricultural burning.
  (b) Other Categories of Sources Contributing to Nonattainment of the 
PM-10 Standard.--The Administrator shall--
          (1) examine other categories of sources contributing to 
        nonattainment of the PM-10 standard;
          (2) determine whether additional guidance on reasonably 
        available control measures and best available control measures 
        is needed; and

                  (B) Applicability for useful life.--The standards 
                shall be applicable to such vehicles and engines for 
                their useful life, whether the vehicles and engines are 
                designed as complete systems or incorporate devices to 
                prevent or control air pollution.
                  (C) Regulations.--The Administrator shall prescribe 
                regulations under which the useful life of vehicles and 
                engines shall be determined for purposes of this 
                paragraph and section 221107 of this title. The 
                regulations shall provide that except where a different 
                useful life period is specified in this subdivision--
                          (i) in the case of light-duty vehicles and 
                        light-duty vehicle engines and light-duty 
                        trucks up to 3,750 pounds loaded vehicle weight 
                        and up to 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight 
                        rating, useful life shall be a period of use of 
                        5 years or 50,000 miles (or the equivalent), 
                        whichever first occurs, except that in the case 
                        of any requirement of this section where the 
                        useful life period is not otherwise specified 
                        for light-duty vehicles and light-duty vehicle 
                        engines, the period shall be 10 years or 
                        100,000 miles (or the equivalent), whichever 
                        first occurs, with testing for purposes of in-
                        use compliance under section 221107 of this 
                        title up to (but not beyond) 7 years or 75,000 
                        miles (or the equivalent), whichever first 
                        occurs;
                          (ii) in the case of any other motor vehicle 
                        or motor vehicle engine (other than motorcycles 
                        or motorcycle engines), useful life shall be a 
                        period of use set forth in clause (i) unless 
                        the Administrator determines that a period of 
                        use of greater duration or mileage is 
                        appropriate; and
                          (iii) in the case of any motorcycle or 
                        motorcycle engine, useful life shall be a 
                        period of use determined by the Administrator.
          (2) Effective date.--Any regulation prescribed under 
        paragraph (1) (and any revision thereof) shall take effect 
        after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to 
        permit the development and application of the requisite 
        technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of 
        compliance within that period.
          (3) Heavy-duty vehicles and engines.--
                  (A) In general.--
                          (i) Greatest degree of emission reduction.--
                        Unless the standard is changed as provided in 
                        subparagraph (B), regulations under paragraph 
                        (1) applicable to emissions of hydrocarbons, 
                        carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and 
                        particulate matter from classes or categories 
                        of heavy-duty vehicles or engines shall contain 
                        standards that reflect the greatest degree of 
                        emission reduction achievable through the 
                        application of technology that the 
                        Administrator determines will be available for 
                        the model year to which the standards apply, 
                        giving appropriate consideration to cost, 
                        energy, and safety factors associated with the 
                        application of the technology.
                          (ii) Classes and categories.--In establishing 
                        classes or categories of vehicles or engines 
                        for purposes of regulations under this 
                        paragraph, the Administrator may base the 
                        classes or categories on gross vehicle weight, 
                        horsepower, type of fuel used, or other 
                        appropriate factors.
                  (B) Revised standards for heavy-duty vehicles.--
                          (i) In general.--On the basis of information 
                        available to the Administrator concerning the 
                        effects of air pollutants emitted from heavy-
                        duty vehicles or engines and from other sources 
                        of mobile source-related pollutants on the 
                        public health and welfare, and taking costs 
                        into account, the Administrator may promulgate 
                        regulations under paragraph (1) revising any 
                        standard promulgated under, or before the date 
                        of enactment of, Public Law 101-549 (104 Stat. 
                        2399) (commonly known as the Clean Air Act 
                        Amendments of 1990) (or previously revised 
                        under this subparagraph) and applicable to 
                        classes or categories of heavy-duty vehicles or 
                        engines.
                          (ii) Nitrogen oxides.--The regulations under 
                        paragraph (1) applicable to emissions of 
                        nitrogen oxides from gasoline-fueled heavy-duty 
                        vehicles and diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles 
                        shall contain standards that provide that such 
                        emissions may not exceed 4.0 grams per brake 
                        horsepower hour.
                  (C) Lead time and stability.--Any standard 
                promulgated or revised under this paragraph and 
                applicable to classes or categories of heavy-duty 
                vehicles or engines shall apply for a period of not 
                less than 3 model years beginning not earlier than the 
                model year commencing 4 years after the revised 
                standard is promulgated.
                  (D) Rebuilding practices.--
                          (i) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                        study the practice of rebuilding heavy-duty 
                        engines and the impact rebuilding has on engine 
                        emissions. On the basis of that study and other 
                        information available to the Administrator, the 
                        Administrator may prescribe requirements to 
                        control rebuilding practices, including 
                        standards applicable to emissions from any 
                        rebuilt heavy-duty engines (whether or not the 
                        engine is past its statutory useful life), that 
                        in the Administrator's judgment, cause or 
                        contribute to air pollution that may reasonably 
                        be anticipated to endanger public health or 
                        welfare, taking costs into account.
                          (ii) Effective date.--Any regulation shall 
                        take effect after a period that the 
                        Administrator finds necessary to permit the 
                        development and application of the requisite 
                        control measures, giving appropriate 
                        consideration to the cost of compliance within 
                        the period and energy and safety factors.
                  (E) Motorcycles.--For purposes of this paragraph, 
                motorcycles and motorcycle engines shall be treated in 
                the same manner as heavy-duty vehicles and engines 
                (except as otherwise permitted under section 221106(f) 
                of this title) unless the Administrator promulgates a 
                regulation reclassifying motorcycles as light-duty 
                vehicles within the meaning of this section or unless 
                the Administrator promulgates regulations under this 
                subsection applying standards applicable to the 
                emission of air pollutants from motorcycles as a 
                separate class or category. In any case in which such 
                standards are promulgated for such emissions from 
                motorcycles as a separate class or category, the 
                Administrator, in promulgating the standards, shall 
                consider the need to achieve equivalency of emission 
                reductions between motorcycles and other motor vehicles 
                to the maximum extent practicable.
          (4) No causation of contribution to unreasonable risk to 
        public health or safety.--
                  (A) In general.--No emission control device, system, 
                or element of design shall be used in a new motor 
                vehicle or new motor vehicle engine for purposes of 
                complying with requirements prescribed under this 
                subdivision if the device, system, or element of design 
                will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to 
                public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or 
                function.
                  (B) Considerations.--In determining whether an 
                unreasonable risk exists under subparagraph (A), the 
                Administrator shall consider, among other factors--
                          (i) whether and to what extent the use of any 
                        device, system, or element of design causes, 
                        increases, reduces, or eliminates emissions of 
                        any unregulated pollutants;
                          (ii) available methods for reducing or 
                        eliminating any risk to public health, welfare, 
                        or safety that may be associated with the use 
                        of the device, system, or element of design;
                          (iii) the availability of other devices, 
                        systems, or elements of design that may be used 
                        to conform to requirements prescribed under 
                        this subdivision without causing or 
                        contributing to the unreasonable risk; and
                          (iv) all relevant information developed 
                        pursuant to section 214 of the Clean Air Act 
                        (42 U.S.C. 7548) (as in effect before the 
                        repeal of that section).
          (5) Fill pipe standards.--
                  (A) Definition of fill pipe.--In this paragraph, the 
                term ``fill pipe'' includes a fuel tank fill pipe, fill 
                neck, fill inlet, and closure.
                  (B) In general.--If the Administrator promulgates 
                final regulations that define the degree of control 
                required and the test procedures by which compliance 
                could be determined for gasoline vapor recovery of 
                uncontrolled emissions from the fueling of motor 
                vehicles, the Administrator shall, after consultation 
                with the Secretary of Transportation with respect to 
                motor vehicle safety, prescribe, by regulation, fill 
                pipe standards for new motor vehicles to ensure 
                effective connection between the fill pipe and any 
                vapor recovery system that the Administrator determines 
                may be required to comply with the vapor recovery 
                regulations.
                  (C) Considerations.--In promulgating standards under 
                subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall take into 
                consideration--
                          (i) limits on fill pipe diameter;
                          (ii) minimum design criteria for nozzle 
                        retainer lips;
                          (iii) limits on the location of the unleaded 
                        fuel restrictors;
                          (iv) a minimum access zone surrounding a fill 
                        pipe;
                          (v) a minimum pipe or nozzle insertion angle; 
                        and
                          (vi) such other factors as the Administrator 
                        considers pertinent.
                  (D) Effective date.--Regulations prescribing 
                standards under subparagraph (B) shall not become 
                effective until the introduction of the model year for 
                which it would be feasible to implement the standards, 
                taking into consideration the restraints of an adequate 
                leadtime for design and production.
                  (E) Effect of paragraph.--Nothing in this paragraph 
                shall--
                          (i) prevent the Administrator from specifying 
                        different nozzle and fill neck sizes for 
                        gasoline with additives and gasoline without 
                        additives; or
                          (ii) permit the Administrator to require a 
                        specific location, configuration, modeling, or 
                        styling of a motor vehicle body with respect to 
                        the fuel tank fill neck or fill nozzle 
                        clearance envelope.
          (6) Onboard vapor recovery.--
                  (A) In general.--After consultation with the 
                Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of 
                vehicle-based (``onboard'') systems for the control of 
                vehicle refueling emissions, the Administrator shall 
                promulgate standards under this section requiring that 
                new light-duty vehicles manufactured beginning in the 
                4th model year after the model year in which the 
                standards are promulgated and thereafter shall be 
                equipped with onboard vapor recovery systems.
                  (B) Implementation schedule.--Beginning with the 4th 
                model year after the model year in which the standards 
                are promulgated, the standards required under this 
                paragraph shall apply to the following percentages of 
                each manufacturer's fleet of new light-duty vehicles:

                  (C) Minimum evaporative emission capture 
                efficiency.--The standards required under this 
                paragraph shall require that onboard vapor recovery 
                systems provide a minimum evaporative emission capture 
                efficiency of 95 percent.
                  (D) Other requirements.--The requirements of section 
                215203(b)(4) of this title for areas classified under 
                section 215202 of this title as a moderate area for 
                ozone shall not apply after promulgation of standards 
                under this paragraph, and the Administrator may, by 
                regulation, revise or waive the application of the 
                requirements of section 215203(b)(4) of this title for 
                areas classified under section 215202 of this title as 
                a serious area, severe area, or extreme area for ozone, 
                as appropriate, after such time as the Administrator 
                determines that onboard emission control systems 
                required under this paragraph are in widespread use 
                throughout the motor vehicle fleet.
  (b) Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons, and Nitrogen Oxides.--

  (c) New Power Sources or Propulsion Systems.--If a new power source 
or propulsion system for new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines is submitted for certification pursuant to section 221106(a) of 
this title, the Administrator may postpone certification until the 
Administrator has prescribed standards for any air pollutants emitted 
by the vehicle or engine that in the Administrator's judgment cause or 
contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger the public health or welfare but for which standards have not 
been prescribed under subsection (a).
  (d) High Altitude Regulations.--
          (1) In general.--Any high altitude regulation with respect to 
        motor vehicles or engines shall not require a percentage of 
        reduction in emissions that is greater than the required 
        percentage of reduction in emissions from motor vehicles and 
        engines set forth in subsection (b). The percentage reduction 
        shall be determined by comparing any proposed high altitude 
        emission standards to high altitude emissions from vehicles and 
        engines manufactured during model year 1970.
          (2) Docket.--Section 203102(d) of this title shall apply to 
        any high altitude regulation under paragraph (1).
          (3) Considerations.--Before promulgating any regulation under 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider and make a 
        finding with respect to--
                  (A) the economic impact on consumers, individual high 
                altitude dealers, and the automobile industry of any 
                such regulation, including the economic impact that was 
                experienced as a result of the regulation imposed 
                during model year 1977 with respect to high altitude 
                certification requirements;
                  (B) the present and future availability of emission 
                control technology capable of meeting the applicable 
                vehicle and engine emission requirements without 
                reducing model availability; and
                  (C) the likelihood that the adoption of such a high 
                altitude regulation will result in any significant 
                improvement in air quality in any area to which the 
                regulation will apply.
          (4) Inapplicability of earlier regulation.--The high altitude 
        regulation in effect with respect to model year 1977 motor 
        vehicles shall not apply to the manufacture, distribution, or 
        sale of later model year motor vehicles.
  (e) Buses.--The regulations under subsection (a) applicable to buses 
other than those subject to standards under section 221117 of this 
title shall contain a standard that provides that emissions of

          (3) Examination of need for further reductions.--
                  (A) In general.--As part of the study under paragraph 
                (1), the Administrator shall examine the need for 
                further reductions in emissions in order to attain or 
                maintain the NAAQSes, taking into consideration the 
                waiver provisions of section 221109 of this title. As 
                part of the study, the Administrator shall examine--
                          (i) the availability of technology (including 
                        the costs thereof), in the case of light-duty 
                        vehicles and light-duty trucks with a loaded 
                        vehicle weight of 3,750 pounds or less, for 
                        meeting more stringent emission standards than 
                        those provided in subsections (f) and (g) for 
                        model years commencing not earlier than after 
                        January 1, 2003, and not later than model year 
                        2006, including the lead time and safety and 
                        energy impacts of meeting more stringent 
                        emission standards; and
                          (ii) the need for, and cost effectiveness of, 
                        obtaining further reductions in emissions from 
                        light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks with 
                        a loaded vehicle weight of 3,750 pounds or 
                        less, taking into consideration alternative 
                        means of attaining or maintaining the primary 
                        NAAQSes pursuant to State implementation plans 
                        and other requirements of this division, 
                        including their feasibility and cost 
                        effectiveness.
                  (B) Report.--The Administrator shall submit a report 
                to Congress containing the results of the study under 
                this subsection, including the results of the 
                examination conducted under subparagraph (A). Before 
                submittal of the report the Administrator shall provide 
                a reasonable opportunity for public comment and shall 
                include a summary of public comments in the report to 
                Congress.
          (4) Determination.--
                  (A) In general.--Based on the study under paragraph 
                (1), the Administrator shall determine, by regulation, 
                whether--
                          (i) there is a need for further reductions in 
                        emissions as provided in paragraph (3)(A);
                          (ii) the technology for meeting more 
                        stringent emission standards will be available, 
                        as provided in paragraph (3)(A)(i), in the case 
                        of light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks 
                        with a loaded vehicle weight of 3,750 pounds or 
                        less, for model years commencing not earlier 
                        than January 1, 2003, and not later than model 
                        year 2006, considering the factors listed in 
                        paragraph (3)(A)(i); and
                          (iii) obtaining further reductions in 
                        emissions from such vehicles will be needed and 
                        cost effective, taking into consideration 
                        alternatives as provided in paragraph 
                        (3)(A)(ii).
                  (B) No more stringent standards.--
                          (i) In general.--If the Administrator 
                        determines under subparagraph (A) that--

                        final order not subject to further judicial 
                        review and the violator has paid a penalty 
                        assessment under this subsection;

                district in which the violation is alleged to have 
                occurred, in which the person resides, or where such 
                person's principal place of business is located, within 
                the 30-day period beginning on the date on which a 
                civil penalty order is issued. The person shall 
                simultaneously send a copy of the filing by certified 
                mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General.
                  (B) Record.--The Administrator shall file in the 
                court a certified copy, or certified index, as 
                appropriate, of the record on which the order was 
                issued within 30 days.
                  (C) Scope of review.--The court shall not set aside 
                or remand any order issued in accordance with the 
                requirements of this subsection unless there is not 
                substantial evidence in the record, taken as a whole, 
                to support the finding of a violation or unless the 
                Administrator's assessment of the penalty constitutes 
                an abuse of discretion, and the court shall not impose 
                additional civil penalties unless the Administrator's 
                assessment of the penalty constitutes an abuse of 
                discretion.
                  (D) Civil penalties.--In any proceedings, the United 
                States may seek to recover civil penalties assessed 
                under this section.
          (6) Collection.--
                  (A) In general.--If any person fails to pay an 
                assessment of a civil penalty imposed by the 
                Administrator as provided in this subsection--
                          (i) after the order making the assessment has 
                        become final; or
                          (ii) after a court in an action brought under 
                        paragraph (5) has entered a final judgment in 
                        favor of the Administrator;
                the Administrator shall request the Attorney General to 
                bring a civil action in an appropriate district court 
                to recover the amount assessed (plus interest at rates 
                established pursuant to section 6621(a)(2) of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)) 
                from the date of the final order or the date of the 
                final judgment, as the case may be).
                  (B) Scope of review.--In such an action, the 
                validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty 
                shall not be subject to review.
                  (C) Enforcement expenses; nonpayment penalty.--
                          (i) In general.--Any person that fails to pay 
                        on a timely basis the amount of an assessment 
                        of a civil penalty as described in subparagraph 
                        (A) shall be required to pay, in addition to 
                        that amount and interest--
                                  (I) the enforcement expenses of the 
                                United States, including attorney's 
                                fees and costs for collection 
                                proceedings; and
                                  (II) a quarterly nonpayment penalty 
                                for each quarter during which the 
                                failure to pay persists.
                          (ii) Amount.--The nonpayment penalty for a 
                        quarter shall be in an amount equal to 10 
                        percent of the aggregate amount of the person's 
                        penalties and nonpayment penalties that are 
                        unpaid as of the beginning of the quarter.
Sec. 221106. Motor vehicle and motor vehicle engine compliance testing 
                    and certification
  (a) Testing and Issuance of Certificate of Conformity.--
          (1) New motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines 
        submitted by a manufacturer.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall test, or 
                require to be tested in such manner as the 
                Administrator considers appropriate, any new motor 
                vehicle or new motor vehicle engine submitted by a 
                manufacturer to determine whether the vehicle or engine 
                conforms with the regulations prescribed under section 
                221102 of this title. If the vehicle or engine conforms 
                to the regulations, the Administrator shall issue a 
                certificate of conformity on such terms, and for such 
                period (not in excess of 1 year), as the Administrator 
                may prescribe.
                  (B) Projected sales not exceeding 300.--In the case 
                of any original equipment manufacturer (as defined by 
                the Administrator in regulations promulgated before 
                November 15, 1990) of vehicles or vehicle engines whose 
                projected sales in the United States for any model year 
                (as determined by the Administrator) will not exceed 
                300, the Administrator shall not require, for purposes 
                of determining compliance with regulations under 
                section 221102 of this title for the useful life of the 
                vehicle or engine, operation of any vehicle or engine 
                manufactured during that model year for more than 5,000 
                miles or 160 hours, respectively, unless the 
                Administrator, by regulation, prescribes otherwise. The 
                Administrator shall apply any adjustment factors that 
                the Administrator considers appropriate to ensure that 
                each vehicle or engine will comply during its useful 
                life (as determined under section 221102(a)(1)(C) of 
                this title) with the regulations prescribed under 
                section 221102 of this title.
          (2) Emission control systems submitted by any person.--The 
        Administrator shall test any emission control system 
        incorporated in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine 
        submitted to the Administrator by any person to determine 
        whether the system enables the vehicle or engine to conform to 
        the standards required to be prescribed under section 221102(b) 
        of this title. If the Administrator finds on the basis of such 
        tests that the vehicle or engine conforms to the standards, the 
        Administrator shall issue a verification of compliance with 
        emission standards for the system when incorporated in vehicles 
        of a class of which the tested vehicle is representative. The 
        Administrator shall inform manufacturers and the National 
        Academy of Sciences, and make available to the public, the 
        results of the tests. Tests under this paragraph shall be 
        conducted under such terms and conditions (including 
        requirements for preliminary testing by qualified independent 
        laboratories) as the Administrator may prescribe by regulation.
          (3) Conformity to requirements.--
                  (A) In general.--A certificate of conformity may be 
                issued under this section only if the Administrator 
                determines that the manufacturer (or in the case of a 
                vehicle or engine for import, any person) has 
                established to the satisfaction of the Administrator 
                that any emission control device, system, or element of 
                design installed on, or incorporated in, a vehicle or 
                engine conforms to applicable requirements of section 
                221102(a)(4) of this title.
                  (B) Tests.--The Administrator may conduct such tests 
                and may require the manufacturer (or any such person) 
                to conduct such tests and provide such information as 
                are necessary to carry out subparagraph (A). Such 
                requirements shall include a requirement for prompt 
                reporting of the emission of any unregulated pollutant 
                from a system, device, or element of design if the 
                pollutant was not emitted, or was emitted in 
                significantly lesser amounts, from the vehicle or 
                engine without use of the system, device, or element of 
                design.
          (4) Light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.--The 
        regulations promulgated under this subsection shall include 
        test procedures capable of determining whether light-duty 
        vehicles and light-duty trucks, when properly maintained and 
        used, will pass the inspection methods and procedures 
        established under section 221107(c) of this title under 
        conditions reasonably likely to be encountered in the conduct 
        of inspection and maintenance programs, but which those 
        programs cannot reasonably influence or control. The conditions 
        shall include fuel characteristics, ambient temperature, and 
        short (30 minutes or less) waiting periods before tests are 
        conducted. The Administrator shall not grant a certificate of 
        conformity under this subsection for any vehicle or engine that 
        the Administrator concludes cannot pass the test procedures 
        established under this paragraph.
  (b) New Motor Vehicles and New Motor Vehicle Engines Being 
Manufactured.--
          (1) In general.--To determine whether new motor vehicles or 
        new motor vehicle engines conform to the regulations with 
        respect to which a certificate of conformity is issued, the 
        Administrator may test the new motor vehicles and new motor 
        vehicle engines. The tests may be conducted by the 
        Administrator directly or, in accordance with conditions 
        specified by the Administrator, by the manufacturer of the new 
        motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.
          (2) Nonconformity.--
                  (A) In general.--
                          (i) Determination on test of sample of new 
                        motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.--
                        If, based on tests conducted under paragraph 
                        (1) on a sample of new motor vehicles or new 
                        motor vehicle engines covered by a certificate 
                        of conformity, the Administrator determines 
                        that all or part of the new motor vehicles or 
                        new motor vehicle engines do not conform with 
                        the regulations with respect to which the 
                        certificate of conformity was issued and with 
                        the requirements of section 221102(a)(4) of 
                        this title, the Administrator may suspend or 
                        revoke the certificate in whole or in part, and 
                        shall so notify the manufacturer. The 
                        suspension or revocation shall apply in the 
                        case of any new motor vehicles or new motor 
                        vehicle engines manufactured after the date of 
                        such notification (or manufactured before that 
                        date if still in the possession of the 
                        manufacturer), and shall apply until such time 
                        as the Administrator finds that new motor 
                        vehicles and new motor vehicle engines 
                        manufactured by the manufacturer conform to the 
                        regulations and requirements. If, during any 
                        period of suspension or revocation, the 
                        Administrator finds that a new motor vehicle or 
                        new motor vehicle engine conforms to the 
                        regulations and requirements, the Administrator 
                        shall issue a certificate of conformity 
                        applicable to the new motor vehicle or new 
                        motor vehicle engine.
                          (ii) Determination on test of any new motor 
                        vehicle or new motor vehicle engine.--If, based 
                        on tests conducted under paragraph (1) on any 
                        new vehicle or engine, the Administrator 
                        determines that the vehicle or engine does not 
                        conform with the regulations with respect to 
                        which the certificate of conformity was issued 
                        and with the requirements of section 
                        221102(a)(4) of this title, the Administrator 
                        may suspend or revoke the certificate insofar 
                        as it applies to the vehicle or engine until 
                        such time as the Administrator finds that the 
                        vehicle or engine actually conforms with those 
                        regulations and requirements, and the 
                        Administrator shall so notify the manufacturer.
                  (B) Hearing.--At the request of any manufacturer the 
                Administrator shall grant the manufacturer a hearing as 
                to whether the tests have been properly conducted or 
                any sampling methods have been properly applied, and 
                make a determination on the record with respect to any 
                suspension or revocation under subparagraph (A); but 
                suspension or revocation under subparagraph (A) shall 
                not be stayed by reason of such a hearing.
                  (C) Judicial review.--
                          (i) In general.--In any case of actual 
                        controversy as to the validity of any 
                        determination under subparagraph (B), the 
                        manufacturer may at any time prior to the 60th 
                        day after the determination is made file a 
                        petition with the United States court of 
                        appeals for the circuit in which the 
                        manufacturer resides or has its principal place 
                        of business for a judicial review of the 
                        determination. A copy of the petition shall be 
                        forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court 
                        to the Administrator or other officer 
                        designated by the Administrator for that 
                        purpose. The Administrator thereupon shall file 
                        in the court the record of the proceedings on 
                        which the Administrator based the 
                        Administrator's determination, as provided in 
                        section 2112 of title 28.
                          (ii) Additional evidence.--If the petitioner 
                        applies to the court for leave to adduce 
                        additional evidence, and shows to the 
                        satisfaction of the court that the additional 
                        evidence is material and that there were 
                        reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce 
                        the evidence in the proceeding before the 
                        Administrator, the court may order the 
                        additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal 
                        thereof) to be taken before the Administrator, 
                        in such manner and on such terms and conditions 
                        as the court considers proper. The 
                        Administrator may modify the Administrator's 
                        findings as to the facts, or make new findings, 
                        by reason of the additional evidence so taken, 
                        and the Administrator shall file the modified 
                        or new findings, and the Administrator's 
                        recommendation, if any, for the modification or 
                        setting aside of the Administrator's original 
                        determination, with the return of the 
                        additional evidence.
                          (iii) Jurisdiction; relief.--On the filing of 
                        the petition under clause (i), the court shall 
                        have jurisdiction to review the order in 
                        accordance with chapter 7 of title 5 and to 
                        grant appropriate relief as provided in that 
                        chapter.
  (c) Inspection.--
          (1) In general.--For purposes of enforcement of this section, 
        officers or employees duly designated by the Administrator, on 
        presenting appropriate credentials to the manufacturer or 
        person in charge, may--
                  (A) enter, at reasonable times, any plant or other 
                establishment of a manufacturer, for the purpose of 
                conducting tests of vehicles or engines in the 
                possession of the manufacturer; or
                  (B) inspect, at reasonable times, records, processes, 
                controls, and facilities used by a manufacturer in 
                conducting tests under regulations of the 
                Administrator.
          (2) Promptness.--An inspection under paragraph (1) shall be 
        commenced and completed with reasonable promptness.
  (d) Methods and Procedures for Making Tests.--The Administrator shall 
by regulation establish methods and procedures for making tests under 
this section.
  (e) Publication of Test Results.--At the beginning of each model 
year, the Administrator shall make available to the public the results 
of the Administrator's tests of any motor vehicle or motor vehicle 
engine submitted by a manufacturer under subsection (a). The results 
shall be described in such a nontechnical manner as will reasonably

        be suspended or revoked under subsection (b)(2) for such 
        vehicles or engines or motorcycles manufactured by a 
        manufacturer notwithstanding the failure of the vehicles or 
        engines or motorcycles to meet that standard if the 
        manufacturer pays a nonconformance penalty as provided under 
        regulations promulgated by the Administrator after notice and 
        opportunity for public hearing.
          (2) Excessive degree of failure.--No certificate of

        conformity has been issued under this subsection, any warranty 
        required under section 221107(c)(2)(B) of this title and any 
        action under section 221107(d) of this title shall be required 
        to be effective only for the emission levels for which the 
        Administrator determines that the certificate was issued and 
        not for the emission levels required under the applicable 
        standard.
          (5) Authorities.--The authorities of section 221108(a) of 
        this title shall apply, subject to the conditions of section

                                          (aa) service performed by the 
                                        franchised dealers of the 
                                        manufacturer or any other 
                                        service establishments with 
                                        which the manufacturer has a 
                                        commercial relationship; and
                                          (bb) service performed by 
                                        independent automotive repair 
                                        facilities with which the 
                                        manufacturer has no commercial 
                                        relationship.
                          (ii) Waiver.--The prohibition of this 
                        subparagraph may be waived by the Administrator 
                        if--
                                  (I) the manufacturer satisfies the 
                                Administrator that the vehicle or 
                                engine will function properly only if 
                                the component or service identified by 
                                brand, trade, or corporate name is used 
                                in connection with the vehicle or 
                                engine; and
                                  (II) the Administrator finds that 
                                such a waiver is in the public 
                                interest.
                  (C) Label or tag.--The manufacturer shall indicate by 
                means of a label or tag permanently affixed to the 
                vehicle or engine that the vehicle or engine is covered

Administrator by any person that records, reports, or information, or a 
particular portion thereof (other than emission data), to which the 
Administrator has access under this section, if made public, would 
divulge methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of 
that person, the Administrator shall consider the record, report, or 
information or particular portion thereof confidential in accordance 
with section 1905 of title 18. Any authorized representative of the 
Administrator shall be considered an employee of the United States for 
purposes of section 1905 of title 18.
  (d) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section prohibits the 
Administrator or authorized representative of the Administrator from 
disclosing records, reports, or information to other officers, 
employees, or authorized representatives of the United States concerned 
with carrying out this division or when relevant in any proceeding 
under this division. Nothing in this section authorizes the withholding 
of information by the Administrator or any officer or employee under 
the Administrator's control from the duly authorized committees of 
Congress.
Sec. 221109. State standards
  (a) Prohibitions.--
          (1) Standards.--No State or any political subdivision thereof 
        shall adopt or attempt to enforce any standard relating to the 
        control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor

        titling (if any), or registration of the motor vehicle, motor 
        vehicle engine, or equipment.
  (b) Waiver.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator shall, after notice and 
        opportunity for public hearing, waive application of this 
        section to any State that adopted standards (other than 
        crankcase emission standards) for the control of emissions from 
        new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines prior to March 
        30, 1966, if the State determines that the State standards will 
        be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health 
        and welfare as applicable Federal standards.
          (2) Limitation.--No such waiver shall be granted if the 
        Administrator finds that--
                  (A) the determination of the State is arbitrary and 
                capricious;
                  (B) the State does not need such State standards to 
                meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; or
                  (C) the State standards and accompanying enforcement 
                procedures are not consistent with section 221102(a) of 
                this title.
          (3) Protectiveness.--If each State standard is at least as 
        stringent as the comparable applicable Federal standard, the 
        State standard shall be deemed to be at least as protective of 
        health and welfare as the Federal standards for purposes of 
        paragraphs (1) and (2).
          (4) Treatment as compliance with federal standards.--In the 
        case of any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine to 
        which State standards apply pursuant to a waiver granted under

        subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce any 
        standard or any requirement of certification, inspection, or 
        approval that relates to motor vehicle emissions and is 
        applicable to the same aspect of that part.
          (2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case 
        of a State with respect to which a waiver is in effect under 
        subsection (b).

          (1) Prohibition of certain state standards.--
                  (A) In general.--No State or any political 
                subdivision thereof shall adopt or attempt to enforce 
                any standard or other requirement relating to the 
                control of emissions from either of the following new 
                nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles subject to 
                regulation under this division:
                          (i) New engines that--
                                  (I) are used in construction 
                                equipment or vehicles or used in farm 
                                equipment or vehicles; and

                or engines other than those described to in clause (i) 
                or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A), the Administrator shall, 
                after notice and opportunity for public hearing, 
                authorize California to adopt and enforce standards and 
                other requirements relating to the control of emissions 
                from such vehicles or engines if California determines 
                that California standards will be, in the aggregate, at 
                least as protective of public health and welfare as 
                applicable Federal standards. No such authorization 
                shall be granted if the Administrator finds that--
                          (i) the determination of California is 
                        arbitrary and capricious;
                          (ii) California does not need such California 
                        standards to meet compelling and extraordinary 
                        conditions; or
                          (iii) California standards and accompanying 
                        enforcement procedures are not consistent with

                  (B) Other states.--Any State other than California 
                that has plan provisions approved under chapter 215 may 
                adopt and enforce, after notice to the Administrator, 
                for any period, standards relating to control of 
                emissions from nonroad vehicles or engines (other than 
                those described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph 
                (1)(A)) and take such other actions as are described in 
                subparagraph (A) of this paragraph respecting such 
                vehicles or engines if--
                          (i) the standards and implementation and 
                        enforcement are identical, for the period 
                        concerned, to the California standards 
                        authorized by the Administrator under 
                        subparagraph (A); and
                          (ii) California and that State adopt the 
                        standards at least 2 years before commencement 
                        of the period for which the standards take 
                        effect.

maintaining effective vehicle emission devices and systems inspection 
and emission testing and control programs.
  (b) Limitations.--No grant under subsection (a) shall be made--
          (1) for any part of any State vehicle inspection program that 
        does not directly relate to the cost of the air pollution 
        control aspects of such a program;
          (2) unless the Secretary of Transportation has certified to 
        the Administrator that the program is consistent with any 
        highway safety program developed pursuant to section 402 of 
        title 23; and
          (3) unless the program includes provisions designed to ensure 
        that emission control devices and systems on vehicles in actual

                                          (cc) the extent to which such 
                                        emissions affect the public 
                                        health or welfare.
                  (B) Test procedures and protocols; no 
                confidentiality.--Tests under subparagraph (A)(i) shall 
                be conducted in conformity with test procedures and 
                protocols established by the Administrator. The result 
                of such tests shall not be considered confidential.
          (3) Registration.--On compliance with this subsection, 
        including assurances that the Administrator will receive 
        changes in the information required, the Administrator shall 
        register the fuel or fuel additive.
  (d) Control or Prohibition of Fuels and Fuel Additives.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may, from time to time on 
        the basis of information obtained under subsection (c) or other 
        information available to the Administrator, by regulation, 
        control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into 
        commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel 
        additive for use in a motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or 
        nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle if--
                  (A) in the judgment of the Administrator, any fuel or 
                fuel additive or any emission product of the fuel or 
                fuel additive causes, or contributes to, air pollution 
                or water pollution (including any degradation in the 
                quality of groundwater) that may reasonably be 
                anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare; 
                or
                  (B) emission products of the fuel or fuel additive 
                will impair to a significant degree the performance of 
                any emission control device or system that is in 
                general use, or that the Administrator finds has been 
                developed to a point where in a reasonable time it 
                would be in general use were such a regulation to be 
                promulgated.
          (2) Requirements for control or prohibition.--
                  (A) Causation of or contribution to air pollution.--
                No fuel, class of fuels, or fuel additive may be 
                controlled or prohibited by the Administrator under 
                paragraph (1)(A) except after consideration of all 
                relevant medical and scientific evidence available to 
                the Administrator, including consideration of other 
                technologically or economically feasible means of 
                achieving emission standards under section 221102 of 
                this title.
                  (B) Impairment of performance of emission control 
                device or system.--
                          (i) In general.--No fuel or fuel additive may 
                        be controlled or prohibited by the 
                        Administrator under paragraph (1)(B) except 
                        after consideration of available scientific and 
                        economic data, including a cost benefit 
                        analysis comparing--
                                  (I) emission control devices or 
                                systems that are or will be in general 
                                use and require the proposed control or 
                                prohibition; with
                                  (II) emission control devices or 
                                systems that are or will be in general 
                                use and do not require the proposed 
                                control or prohibition.
                          (ii) Hearing; findings.--On request of a 
                        manufacturer of motor vehicles, motor vehicle 
                        engines, fuels, or fuel additives that is 
                        submitted within 10 days of notice of proposed 
                        rulemaking, the Administrator shall hold a 
                        public hearing and publish findings with 
                        respect to any matter that the Administrator is 
                        required to consider under this subparagraph. 
                        Such findings shall be published at the time of 
                        promulgation of final regulations.
                  (C) Other fuels and fuel additives.--No fuel or fuel 
                additive may be prohibited by the Administrator under 
                paragraph (1) unless the Administrator finds, and 
                publishes the finding, that in the Administrator's 
                judgment, such a prohibition will not cause the use of 
                any other fuel or fuel additive that will produce 
                emissions that will endanger the public health or 
                welfare to the same degree as or a greater degree than 
                the use of the fuel or fuel additive proposed to be 
                prohibited.
          (3) Evidence and data.--
                  (A) In general.--For the purpose of obtaining 
                evidence and data to carry out paragraph (2), the 
                Administrator may require the manufacturer of any motor 
                vehicle or motor vehicle engine to furnish any 
                information that has been developed concerning the 
                emissions from motor vehicles resulting from the use of 
                any fuel or fuel additive, or the effect of such use on 
                the performance of any emission control device or 
                system.
                  (B) Subpoenas.--In obtaining information under 
                subparagraph (A), section 203102(a) of this title shall 
                be applicable.
          (4) Limitation on state control or prohibition.--
                  (A) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in 
                subparagraph (B) or (C), no State (or political 
                subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to 
                enforce, for purposes of motor vehicle emission 
                control, any control or prohibition respecting any 
                characteristic or component of a fuel or fuel additive 
                in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine--
                          (i) if the Administrator has found that no 
                        control or prohibition of the characteristic or 
                        component of a fuel or fuel additive under 
                        paragraph (1) is necessary and has published 
                        the finding in the Federal Register; or
                          (ii) if the Administrator has prescribed 
                        under paragraph (1) a control or prohibition 
                        applicable to the characteristic or component 
                        of a fuel or fuel additive, unless State 
                        prohibition or control is identical to the 
                        prohibition or control prescribed by the 
                        Administrator.
                  (B) States with waivers.--Any State for which 
                application of section 221109(a) of this title has at 
                any time been waived under section 221109 of this title 
                may at any time prescribe and enforce, for the purpose 
                of motor vehicle emission control, a control or 
                prohibition respecting any fuel or fuel additive.
                  (C) Implementation plans.--
                          (i) In general.--A State may prescribe and 
                        enforce, for purposes of motor vehicle emission 
                        control, a control or prohibition respecting 
                        the use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor 
                        vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an 
                        applicable implementation plan for the State 
                        under section 211110 of this title so provides. 
                        The Administrator may approve such a provision 
                        in an implementation plan, or promulgate an 
                        implementation plan containing such a 
                        provision, only if the Administrator finds that 
                        the State control or prohibition is necessary 
                        to achieve the primary or secondary NAAQS that 
                        the plan implements. The Administrator may find 
                        that a State control or prohibition is 
                        necessary to achieve that standard if no other 
                        measures that would bring about timely 
                        attainment exist, or if other measures exist 
                        and are technically possible to implement, but 
                        are unreasonable or impracticable. The 
                        Administrator may make a finding of necessity 
                        under this subparagraph even if the plan for 
                        the area does not contain an approved 
                        demonstration of timely attainment.
                          (ii) Temporary waiver.--The Administrator may 
                        temporarily waive a control or prohibition 
                        respecting the use of a fuel or fuel additive 
                        required or regulated by the Administrator 
                        pursuant to this subsection or subsection (h), 
                        (i), (m), or (n) or prescribed in an applicable 
                        implementation plan under section 211110 of 
                        this title approved by the Administrator under 
                        clause (i) if, after consultation with, and 
                        concurrence by, the Secretary of Energy, the 
                        Administrator determines that--
                                  (I) extreme and unusual fuel or fuel 
                                additive supply circumstances exist in 
                                a State or region of the Nation that 
                                prevent the distribution of an adequate 
                                supply of the fuel or fuel additive to 
                                consumers;
                                  (II) the extreme and unusual fuel and 
                                fuel additive supply circumstances are 
                                the result of a natural disaster, an 
                                Act of God, a pipeline or refinery 
                                equipment failure, or another event 
                                that could not reasonably have been 
                                foreseen or prevented and not the lack 
                                of prudent planning on the part of the 
                                suppliers of the fuel or fuel additive 
                                to the State or region; and
                                  (III) it is in the public interest to 
                                grant the waiver, such as when a waiver 
                                is necessary to meet projected 
                                temporary shortfalls in the supply of 
                                the fuel or fuel additive in a State or 
                                region of the Nation that cannot 
                                otherwise be compensated for.
                          (iii) Additional requirements.--If the 
                        Administrator makes the determinations 
                        described in clause (ii), a temporary extreme 
                        and unusual fuel and fuel additive supply 
                        circumstances waiver shall be permitted only 
                        if--
                                  (I) the waiver applies to the 
                                smallest geographic area necessary to 
                                address the extreme and unusual fuel 
                                and fuel additive supply circumstances;

                                period of 20 calendar days or, if the 
                                Administrator determines that a shorter 
                                waiver period is adequate, for the 
                                shortest practicable time period 
                                necessary to permit the correction of

                                State implementation plan or if a fuel 
                                in a State implementation plan is 
                                identical to a Federal fuel formulation 
                                implemented by the Administrator, but 
                                the Administrator shall not reduce the

                                        consideration of a control or 
                                        prohibition respecting a new

                                        respecting a new fuel under 
                                        this subclause if the 
                                        Administrator, after 
                                        consultation with the Secretary

                                        Federal Register after notice 
                                        and comment a finding that, in 
                                        the Administrator's judgment, 
                                        the control or prohibition 
                                        respecting a new fuel will not 
                                        cause fuel supply or 
                                        distribution interruptions or 
                                        have a significant adverse 
                                        impact on fuel producibility in 
                                        the affected area or contiguous

                                Administrator shall have no authority 
                                under this paragraph, when considering 
                                any particular State's implementation 
                                plan or a revision to that State's 
                                implementation plan, to approve any 
                                fuel unless that fuel was, as of the 
                                date of such consideration, approved in 
                                at least 1 State implementation plan in 
                                the applicable Petroleum Administration 
                                for Defense District. However, the 
                                Administrator may approve as part of a 
                                State implementation plan or State 
                                implementation plan revision a fuel

                                of 7.0 per square inch. In no event 
                                shall such approval by the 
                                Administrator cause an increase in the 
                                total number of fuels on the list 
                                published under subclause (II).
                                  (VI) Effect of clause.--Nothing in 
                                this clause shall be construed to have 
                                any effect regarding any available 
                                authority of States to require the use 
                                of any fuel additive registered in 
                                accordance with subsection (c).
  (e) Testing of Fuels and Fuel Additives.--
          (1) Regulations.--After notice and opportunity for a public 
        hearing, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations that 
        implement the authority under clauses (i) and (ii) of 
        subsection (c)(2)(A) with respect to each fuel or fuel additive 
        that is registered on the date of promulgation of the 
        regulations and with respect to each fuel or fuel additive for 
        which an application for registration is filed thereafter.
          (2) Provision of information.--Regulations under subsection 
        (c) to carry out this subsection shall require that the 
        requisite information be provided to the Administrator by each 
        manufacturer--
                  (A) prior to registration, in the case of any fuel or 
                fuel additive that is not registered on the date of 
                promulgation of such regulations; or
                  (B) not later than 3 years after the date of 
                promulgation of such regulations, in the case of any 
                fuel or fuel additive that is registered on that date.
          (3) Exemptions; cost sharing.--In promulgating the 
        regulations, the Administrator may--
                  (A) exempt any small business (as defined in the 
                regulations) from, or defer or modify the requirements 
                of, the regulations with respect to any small business;
                  (B) provide for cost sharing with respect to the 
                testing of any fuel or fuel additive that is 
                manufactured or processed by 2 or more persons or 
                otherwise provide for shared responsibility to meet the 
                requirements of this section without duplication; or
                  (C) exempt any person from the regulations with 
                respect to a particular fuel or fuel additive on a 
                finding that any additional testing of that fuel or 
                fuel additive would be duplicative of adequate existing 
                testing.

        manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive, may waive the 
        prohibitions established under paragraph (1) or the limitation 
        specified in paragraph (2) if the Administrator determines that 
        the applicant has established that the fuel or fuel additive or 
        a specified concentration thereof, and the emission products of 
        the fuel or additive or specified concentration thereof, will 
        not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control 
        device or system (over the useful life of any motor vehicle, 
        motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad engine in 
        which the device or system is used) to achieve compliance by 
        the motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle, or 
        nonroad engine with the emission standards with respect to 
        which it has been certified pursuant to sections 221106 and 
        221113(a) of this title. The Administrator shall take final 
        action to grant or deny an application under this paragraph,

        introduce into commerce gasoline with a Reid vapor pressure in 
        excess of 9.0 pounds per square inch. The regulations shall 
        establish more stringent Reid vapor pressure standards in a 
        nonattainment area as the Administrator finds necessary to 
        generally achieve comparable evaporative emissions (on a per-
        vehicle basis) in nonattainment areas, taking into 
        consideration the enforceability of the standards, the need of 
        an area for emission control, and economic factors.
          (2) Attainment areas.--
                  (A) In general.--The regulations under this 
                subsection shall not make it unlawful for any person to 
                sell, offer for supply, transport, or introduce into

                pounds per square inch or lower in any area designated 
                under section 211107 of this title as an attainment 
                area.
                  (B) Former ozone nonattainment areas redesignated as 
                an attainment area.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), 
                the Administrator may impose a Reid vapor pressure 
                requirement lower than 9.0 pounds per square inch in 
                any area, formerly an ozone nonattainment area, that 
                has been redesignated as an attainment area.
          (3) Enforcement.--The regulations under this subsection shall 
        include such provisions as the Administrator determines are 
        necessary to implement and enforce the requirements of this 
        subsection.

                regulations establishing requirements for reformulated 
                gasoline to be used in gasoline-fueled vehicles in 
                specified nonattainment areas. The regulations shall 
                require the greatest reduction in emissions of ozone-
                forming volatile organic compounds (during the high 
                ozone season) and emissions of toxic air pollutants 
                (during the entire year) achievable through the 
                reformulation of conventional gasoline, taking into 
                consideration--
                          (i) the cost of achieving the emission 
                        reductions; and
                          (ii) any air-quality related and non-air-
                        quality related health and environmental 
                        impacts and energy requirements.
                  (B) Maintenance of toxic air pollutant emissions 
                reductions from reformulated gasoline.--The 
                Administrator shall promulgate regulations to control 
                hazardous air pollutants from motor vehicles and motor 
                vehicle fuels, as provided for in section 80.1045 of 
                title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on 
                August 8, 2005), and as authorized under section 
                221102(k) of this title.
          (3) General requirements.--
                  (A) In general.--The regulations under paragraph (2) 
                shall require that reformulated gasoline comply with 
                paragraph (4) and with each of the requirements stated 
                in this paragraph (subject to paragraph (8)).
                  (B) Nitrogen oxide emissions.--
                          (i) In general.--The emissions of nitrogen 
                        oxides from baseline vehicles when using the 
                        reformulated gasoline shall be not greater than 
                        the level of such emissions from such vehicles 
                        when using baseline gasoline.
                          (ii) Technical infeasibility.--If the 
                        Administrator determines that compliance with 
                        the limitation on emissions of nitrogen oxides 
                        under clause (i) is technically infeasible, 
                        considering the other requirements applicable 
                        under this subsection to reformulated gasoline, 
                        the Administrator may, as appropriate to ensure 
                        compliance with this subparagraph, adjust (or 
                        waive entirely), any other requirements of this 
                        paragraph or any requirements applicable under 
                        paragraph (4)(B).

                        shall have no heavy metals, including lead or 
                        manganese.
                          (ii) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive the 
                        prohibition contained in clause (i) for a heavy 
                        metal (other than lead) if the Administrator 
                        determines that addition of the heavy metal to 
                        the reformulated gasoline will not increase, on 
                        an aggregate mass or cancer-risk basis, toxic 
                        air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles.

                        in emissions of ozone-forming volatile organic 
                        compounds and emissions of toxic air pollutants 
                        than are achieved by a reformulated gasoline 
                        meeting the applicable requirements of 
                        paragraph (4).
                  (C) Determination of emissions level.--The 
                Administrator shall determine the level of emissions of 
                ozone-forming volatile organic compounds and emissions 
                of toxic air pollutants emitted by baseline vehicles 
                when operating on baseline gasoline. For purposes of 
                this subsection, the Administrator shall, by 
                regulation, determine appropriate measures of, and 
                methodology for, ascertaining the emissions of air

                                          (aa) shall extend the 
                                        effective date of the 
                                        prohibitions in marginal areas, 
                                        moderate areas, serious areas, 
                                        or severe areas described in

          (8) Credits.--
                  (A) In general.--The regulations promulgated under 
                this subsection shall provide for the granting of an 
                appropriate amount of credits to a person that refines, 
                blends, or imports and certifies a gasoline or slate of 
                gasoline that--
                          (i) has an aromatic hydrocarbon content (by 
                        volume) that is less than the maximum aromatic 
                        hydrocarbon content required to comply with 
                        paragraph (4); or
                          (ii) has a benzene content (by volume) that 
                        is less than the maximum benzene content 
                        specified in paragraph (3).
                  (B) Use.--The regulations described in subparagraph 
                (A) shall provide that a person that is granted credits 
                may use the credits, or transfer all or a portion of 
                the credits to another person for use within the same 
                nonattainment area, for the purpose of complying with 
                this subsection.
                  (C) Enforcement.--The regulations promulgated under 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall ensure the enforcement 
                of the requirements for the issuance, application, and 
                transfer of credits. The regulations shall prohibit the 
                granting or transfer of credits for use with respect to 
                any gasoline in a nonattainment area, to the extent 
                that the use of the credits would result in--
                          (i) an average gasoline aromatic hydrocarbon 
                        content (by volume) for the nonattainment area 
                        (taking into account all gasoline sold for use 
                        in conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles in the 
                        nonattainment area) higher than the average 
                        fuel aromatic hydrocarbon content (by volume) 
                        that would occur in the absence of using any 
                        such credits; or
                          (ii) an average benzene content (by volume) 
                        for the nonattainment area (taking into account 
                        all gasoline sold for use in conventional 
                        gasoline-fueled vehicles in the nonattainment 
                        area) higher than the average benzene content 
                        (by volume) that would occur in the absence of 
                        using any such credits.
          (9) Antidumping regulations.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                regulations applicable to each refiner, blender, or 
                importer of gasoline ensuring that gasoline sold or 
                introduced into commerce by the refiner, blender, or 
                importer (other than reformulated gasoline subject to 
                the requirements of paragraph (2)) does not result in 
                average per gallon emissions (measured on a mass basis) 
                of--
                          (i) volatile organic compounds;
                          (ii) nitrogen oxides;
                          (iii) carbon monoxide; and
                          (iv) toxic air pollutants;
                in excess of emissions of those pollutants attributable 
                to gasoline sold or introduced into commerce in 
                calendar year 1990 by that refiner, blender, or 
                importer.
                  (B) Adjustments.--In evaluating compliance with the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A), the Administrator 
                shall make appropriate adjustments to ensure that no 
                credit is provided for improvement in motor vehicle 
                emission control in motor vehicles sold after calendar 
                year 1990.
                  (C) Compliance determined for each pollutant 
                independently.--In determining whether there is an 
                increase in emissions in violation of the prohibition 
                contained in subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall 
                consider an increase in each air pollutant described in 
                clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) as a 
                separate violation of the prohibition, except that the 
                Administrator shall promulgate regulations to provide 
                that any increase in emissions of nitrogen oxides 
                resulting from adding oxygenates to gasoline may be 
                offset by an equivalent or greater reduction (on a mass 
                basis) in emissions of volatile organic compounds, 
                carbon monoxide, or toxic air pollutants, or any 
                combination of the foregoing.
                  (D) Compliance period.--The Administrator shall 
                promulgate an appropriate compliance period or 
                appropriate compliance periods to be used for assessing 
                compliance with the prohibition contained in 
                subparagraph (A).
                  (E) Baseline for determining compliance.--If the 
                Administrator determines that no adequate and reliable 
                data exist regarding the composition of gasoline sold 
                or introduced into commerce by a refiner, blender, or 
                importer in calendar year 1990, for that refiner, 
                blender, or importer, baseline gasoline shall be 
                substituted for 1990 gasoline in determining compliance 
                with subparagraph (A).
          (10) Emissions from entire vehicle.--In applying the 
        requirements of this subsection, the Administrator shall take 
        into account emissions from the entire motor vehicle, including 
        evaporative, running, refueling, and exhaust emissions.
  (l) Detergents.--No person may sell or dispense to an ultimate 
consumer in the United States, and no refiner or marketer may directly 
or indirectly sell or dispense to persons that sell or dispense to 
ultimate consumers in the United States, any gasoline that does not 
contain additives to prevent the accumulation of deposits in engines or 
fuel supply systems. The Administrator shall promulgate a regulation 
establishing specifications for such additives.
  (m) Oxygenated Fuels.--
          (1) Plan revisions for carbon monoxide nonattainment areas.--
                  (A) States in which there is located all or part of 
                an area that is designated as a nonattainment area for 
                carbon monoxide and that has a carbon monoxide design 
                value of 9.5 or more parts per million.--The applicable 
                implementation plan of a State in which there is 
                located all or part of an area that is designated under 
                subdivision 2 as a nonattainment area for carbon 
                monoxide and that has a carbon monoxide design value of 
                9.5 or more parts per million based on data for the 2-
                year period of 1988 and 1989 and calculated according 
                to the most recent interpretation methodology issued by 
                the Administrator prior to November 15, 1990, shall 
                contain for that area the provisions specified under 
                this subsection regarding oxygenated gasoline.
                  (B) States in which there is located any area that, 
                for any 2-year period after 1989, has a carbon monoxide 
                design value of 9.5 or more parts per million.--Each 
                State in which there is located any area that, for any 
                2-year period after 1989, has a carbon monoxide design 
                value of 9.5 or more parts per million shall, within 18 
                months after that 2-year period, submit a plan 
                provision that contains the provisions specified under 
                this subsection regarding oxygenated gasoline.
          (2) Oxygenated gasoline in carbon monoxide nonattainment 
        areas.--
                  (A) In general.--Each plan provision under this 
                subsection shall contain provisions to require that any 
                gasoline sold or dispensed to an ultimate consumer in 
                the carbon monoxide nonattainment area or sold or 
                dispensed directly or indirectly by fuel refiners or 
                marketers to persons that sell or dispense to ultimate 
                consumers, in the larger of--
                          (i) the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical 
                        Area in which the area is located; or
                          (ii) if the area is not located in a 
                        Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, the 
                        Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the area 
                        is located;
                be blended, during the portion of the year in which the 
                area is prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon 
                monoxide, to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen 
                by weight (subject to a testing tolerance established 
                by the Administrator).
                  (B) Portion of year.--
                          (i) In general.--The portion of the year in 
                        which the area is prone to high ambient 
                        concentrations of carbon monoxide shall be as 
                        determined by the Administrator, but shall not 
                        be less than 4 months.
                          (ii) Reduction.--At the request of a State 
                        with respect to any area designated as 
                        nonattainment for carbon monoxide, the 
                        Administrator may reduce the period specified 
                        in clause (i) if the State can demonstrate that 
                        because of meteorological conditions, a reduced 
                        period will ensure that there will be no 
                        exceedances of the carbon monoxide standard 
                        outside the reduced period.
                  (C) Effective date.--A plan provision under this 
                subsection shall provide that the requirement shall 
                take effect not later than November 1 of the 3d year 
                after the last year of the applicable 2-year period 
                described in paragraph (1) (or at such other date 
                during the 3d year as the Administrator establishes 
                under subparagraphs (A) and (B)).
                  (D) Implementation and enforcement.--A plan provision 
                under this subsection shall include a program for 
                implementation and enforcement of the requirement 
                consistent with guidance issued by the Administrator.
          (3) Waivers.--
                  (A) Prevention of or interference with attainment for 
                air pollutant other than carbon monoxide.--The 
                Administrator shall waive, in whole or in part, the 
                requirements of paragraph (2) on a demonstration by the 
                State to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the 
                use of oxygenated gasoline would prevent or interfere 
                with the attainment by the area of a primary NAAQS (or 
                a State or local ambient air quality standard) for any 
                air pollutant other than carbon monoxide.
                  (B) No significant contribution to carbon monoxide 
                levels.--The Administrator shall, on demonstration by 
                the State satisfactory to the Administrator, waive the 
                requirements of paragraph (2) where the Administrator 
                determines that mobile sources of carbon monoxide do 
                not contribute significantly to carbon monoxide levels 
                in an area.
                  (C) Inadequate supply or capacity.--
                          (i) Definition of distribution capacity.--In 
                        this subparagraph, the term ``distribution 
                        capacity'' includes capacity for 
                        transportation, storage, and blending.
                          (ii) Petition.--Any person may petition the 
                        Administrator to make a finding that there is, 
                        or is likely to be, for any area, an inadequate 
                        domestic supply of, or distribution capacity 
                        for, oxygenated gasoline meeting the 
                        requirements of paragraph (2) or fuel additives 
                        (oxygenates) necessary to meet those 
                        requirements. The Administrator shall act on 
                        such a petition within 6 months after receipt 
                        of the petition.
                          (iii) Determination of inadequacy.--If the 
                        Administrator determines, in response to a 
                        petition under clause (ii), that there is an 
                        inadequate supply or capacity described in 
                        clause (ii), the Administrator shall delay the 
                        effective date of paragraph (2) for 1 year. On 
                        petition, the Administrator may extend the 
                        effective date for 1 additional year. No 
                        partial delay or lesser waiver may be granted 
                        under this clause.
                          (iv) Considerations.--In granting waivers 
                        under this subparagraph, the Administrator 
                        shall consider distribution capacity separately 
                        from the adequacy of domestic supply and shall 
                        grant such waivers in such a manner as will 
                        ensure that, if supplies of oxygenated gasoline 
                        are limited, areas having the highest design 
                        value for carbon monoxide will have a priority 
                        in obtaining oxygenated gasoline that meets the 
                        requirements of paragraph (2).
          (4) Fuel dispensing systems.--Any person selling oxygenated 
        gasoline at retail pursuant to this subsection shall be 
        required under regulations promulgated by the Administrator to 
        label the fuel dispensing system with a notice that the 
        gasoline is oxygenated and will reduce the carbon monoxide 
        emissions from the motor vehicle.
          (5) Guidelines for credit.--The Administrator shall 
        promulgate guidelines allowing the use, during the portion of 
        the year specified in paragraph (2), of marketable oxygen 
        credits from gasolines with higher oxygen content than required 
        to offset the sale or use of gasoline with a lower oxygen 
        content than is required. No credits may be transferred between 
        nonattainment areas.
          (6) Attainment areas.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        interpreted as requiring an oxygenated gasoline program in an 
        area that is in attainment for carbon monoxide, except that in 
        a carbon monoxide nonattainment area that is redesignated as 
        attainment for carbon monoxide, the requirements of this 
        subsection shall remain in effect to the extent that the 
        program is necessary to maintain the standard thereafter in the 
        area.
          (7) Failure to attain carbon monoxide standard.--If the 
        Administrator determines under section 215302(b)(2) of this 
        title that the primary NAAQS for carbon monoxide has not been 
        attained in a serious area by the applicable attainment date, 
        the State shall submit a plan provision for the area within 9 
        months after the date of the determination. The plan revision 
        shall provide that the minimum oxygen content of gasoline 
        described in paragraph (2) shall be 3.1 percent by weight 
        unless the requirement is waived in accordance with this 
        subsection.
  (n) Prohibition of Leaded Gasoline for Highway Use.--It shall be 
unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, supply, offer for 
supply, dispense, transport, or introduce into commerce, for use as 
fuel in any motor vehicle (as defined in section 221101 of this title) 
any gasoline that contains lead or lead additives.

                cellulosic biofuel projected to be sold or introduced 
                into commerce.
                  (B) Determination of applicable percentages.--
                          (i) In general.--Not later than November 30 
                        of each of calendar years 2009 to 2021, based 
                        on the estimate provided under subparagraph 
                        (A), the Administrator shall determine and 
                        publish in the Federal Register, with respect 
                        to the following calendar year, the renewable 
                        fuel obligation that ensures that the 
                        requirements of paragraph (2) are met.
                          (ii) Required elements.--The renewable fuel 
                        obligation determined for a calendar year under

                                consist of a single applicable 
                                percentage that applies to all 
                                categories of persons specified in 
                                subclause (I).
                  (C) Adjustments.--In determining the applicable 
                percentage for a calendar year, the Administrator shall 
                make adjustments--
                          (i) to prevent the imposition of redundant 
                        obligations on any person specified in 
                        subparagraph (B)(ii)(I); and
                          (ii) to account for the use of renewable fuel 
                        during the previous calendar year by small 
                        refineries that are exempt under paragraph (8).
          (4) Modification of greenhouse gas reduction percentages.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator may, in the 
                regulations under paragraph (2)(A)(i)(II), adjust the 
                20 percent, 50 percent, and 60 percent reductions in 
                lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions specified in 
                paragraphs (2)(A)(i) (relating to renewable fuel), 
                (1)(D) (relating to biomass-based diesel), (1)(B)(i) 
                (relating to advanced biofuel), and (1)(E) (relating to 
                cellulosic biofuel) to a lower percentage. For the 50 
                and 60 percent reductions, the Administrator may make 
                such an adjustment only if the Administrator determines 
                that generally such a reduction is not commercially 
                feasible for fuels made using a variety of feedstocks, 
                technologies, and processes to meet the applicable 
                reduction.
                  (B) Amount of adjustment.--In promulgating 
                regulations under this paragraph, the Administrator 
                shall not--
                          (i) reduce to below 40 percent the specified 
                        50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas 
                        emissions from advanced biofuel and in biomass-
                        based diesel;
                          (ii) reduce to below 10 percent the specified 
                        20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas 
                        emissions from renewable fuel; or
                          (iii) reduce to below 50 percent the 
                        specified 60 percent reduction in greenhouse 
                        gas emissions from cellulosic biofuel.
                  (C) Adjusted reduction levels.--An adjustment under 
                this paragraph to a percentage less than the specified 
                20 percent greenhouse gas reduction for renewable fuel 
                shall be the minimum possible adjustment, and the 
                adjusted greenhouse gas reduction shall be established 
                by the Administrator at the maximum achievable level, 
                taking cost into consideration, for natural gas fired 
                corn-based ethanol plants, allowing for the use of a 
                variety of technologies and processes. An adjustment in 
                the 50 or 60 percent greenhouse gas levels shall be the 
                minimum possible adjustment for the fuel or fuels 
                concerned, and the adjusted greenhouse gas reduction 
                shall be established at the maximum achievable level, 
                taking cost into consideration, allowing for the use of 
                a variety of feedstocks, technologies, and processes.
                  (D) 5-year review.--When the Administrator makes any 
                adjustment under this paragraph, not later than 5 years 
                thereafter the Administrator shall review and revise 
                (based on the same criteria and standards as are 
                required for the initial adjustment) the regulations 
                establishing the adjusted level.
                  (E) Subsequent adjustments.--After the Administrator 
                promulgates a regulation under paragraph (2)(A)(i)(II) 
                with respect to the method of determining lifecycle 
                greenhouse gas emissions, except as provided in 
                subparagraph (D), the Administrator shall not adjust 
                the percentage greenhouse gas reduction levels unless 
                the Administrator determines that there has been a 
                significant change in the analytical methodology used 
                for determining the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. 
                If the Administrator makes such a determination, the 
                Administrator may adjust the 20, 50, or 60 percent 
                reduction levels through rulemaking using the criteria 
                and standards set forth in this paragraph.
                  (F) Limit on upward adjustments.--If, under 
                subparagraph (D) or (E), the Administrator revises a 
                percentage level adjusted as provided in subparagraphs 
                (A), (B), and (C) to a higher percentage, the higher 
                percentage shall not exceed the applicable percent 
                specified in paragraph (2)(A)(i), (1)(D), (1)(B)(i), or 
                (1)(E).
                  (G) Applicability of adjustments.--If the 
                Administrator adjusts or revises a percentage level 
                described in this paragraph or makes a change in the 
                analytical methodology used for determining the 
                lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, the adjustment, 
                revision, or change (or any combination thereof) shall 
                apply only to renewable fuel from new facilities that 
                commence construction after the effective date of the 
                adjustment, revision, or change.
          (5) Credit program.--
                  (A) In general.--The regulations promulgated under 
                paragraph (2)(A) shall provide--

                          (iii) for the generation of credits by small 
                        refineries in accordance with paragraph (8)(C).
                  (B) Use of credits.--A person that generates credits 
                under subparagraph (A) may use the credits, or transfer 
                all or a portion of the credits to another person, for 
                the purpose of complying with paragraph (2).
                  (C) Duration of credits.--A credit generated under 
                this paragraph shall be valid to show compliance for 
                the 12 months as of the date of generation.
                  (D) Inability to generate or purchase sufficient 
                credits.--The regulations promulgated under paragraph 
                (2)(A) shall include provisions allowing any person 
                that is unable to generate or purchase sufficient 
                credits to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) to 
                carry forward a renewable fuel deficit on condition 
                that the person, in the calendar year following the 
                year in which the renewable fuel deficit is created--
                          (i) achieves compliance with the renewable 
                        fuel requirement under paragraph (2); and
                          (ii) generates or purchases additional 
                        renewable fuel credits to offset the renewable

                        generator, or the transfer of all or a portion 
                        of the credits to another person, for the 
                        purpose of complying with paragraph (2).
          (6) Seasonal variations in renewable fuel use.--
                  (A) Study.--For each of calendar years 2006 to 2012, 
                the Administrator of the Energy Information 
                Administration shall conduct a study of renewable fuel 
                blending to determine whether there are excessive 
                seasonal variations in the use of renewable fuel.
                  (B) Regulation of excessive seasonal variations.--If, 
                for any calendar year, the Administrator of the Energy 
                Information Administration, based on the study under 
                subparagraph (A), makes the determinations specified in 
                subparagraph (C), the Administrator of EPA shall 
                promulgate regulations to ensure that 25 percent or 
                more of the quantity of renewable fuel necessary to 
                meet the requirements of paragraph (2) is used during 
                each of the 2 periods specified in subparagraph (D) of

        pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public 
        health or welfare.
          (2) Determination.--After notice and opportunity for public 
        hearing, the Administrator shall determine within 12 months 
        after completion of the study under paragraph (1), based on the 
        results of the study, whether emissions of carbon monoxide, 
        nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds from new and 
        existing nonroad engines or nonroad vehicles (other than 
        locomotives or engines used in locomotives) are significant 
        contributors to ozone or carbon monoxide concentrations in more 
        than 1 area that has failed to attain the NAAQSes for ozone or 
        carbon monoxide. That determination shall be included in the 
        regulations under paragraph (3).
          (3) Regulations.--
                  (A) In general.--If the Administrator makes an 
                affirmative determination under paragraph (2), the 
                Administrator shall, within 12 months after completion 
                of the study under paragraph (1), promulgate (and from 
                time to time revise) regulations containing standards 
                applicable to emissions from the classes or categories 
                of new nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles (other 
                than locomotives or engines used in locomotives) that 
                in the Administrator's judgment, cause or contribute to 
                air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to 
                endanger public health or welfare.
                  (B) Greatest degree of emission reduction 
                achievable.--The standards shall achieve the greatest 
                degree of emission reduction achievable through the 
                application of technology that the Administrator 
                determines will be available for the engines or 
                vehicles to which the standards apply, giving 
                appropriate consideration to--
                          (i) the cost of applying the technology 
                        within the period of time available to

                  (C) Considerations.--Before determining what degree 
                of reduction will be available, the Administrator shall 
                consider standards equivalent in stringency to 
                standards for comparable motor vehicles or engines (if 
                any) regulated under section 221102 of this title, 
                taking into account the technological feasibility, 
                costs, safety, noise, and energy factors associated 
                with achieving, as appropriate, standards of such 
                stringency and lead time.
                  (D) Useful life.--The regulations shall apply to the 
                useful life of the engines or vehicles (as determined 
                by the Administrator).
          (4) Other air pollutants.--
                  (A) In general.--If the Administrator determines that 
                any emissions not described in paragraph (2) from new 
                nonroad engines or vehicles significantly contribute to 
                air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to 
                endanger public health or welfare, the Administrator 
                may promulgate such regulations as the Administrator 
                considers appropriate containing standards applicable 
                to emissions from the classes or categories of new 
                nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles (other than 
                locomotives or engines used in locomotives) that, in 
                the Administrator's judgment, cause or contribute to 
                air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to 
                endanger public health or welfare, taking into account 
                costs, noise, safety, and energy factors associated 
                with the application of technology that the 
                Administrator determines will be available for the 
                engines and vehicles to which the standards apply.
                  (B) Useful life.--The regulations shall apply to the 
                useful life of the engines or vehicles (as determined 
                by the Administrator).
          (5) New locomotives and new engines used in locomotives.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall promulgate 
                regulations containing standards applicable to 
                emissions from new locomotives and new engines used in 
                locomotives.
                  (B) Greatest degree of emission reduction 
                achievable.--The standards shall achieve the greatest 
                degree of emission reduction achievable through the 
                application of technology that the Administrator 
                determines will be available for the locomotives or 
                engines to which the standards apply, giving 
                appropriate consideration to--
                          (i) the cost of applying the technology 
                        within the period of time available to 
                        manufacturers; and
                          (ii) noise, energy, and safety factors 
                        associated with the application of the 
                        technology.
  (b) Effective Date.--Standards under this section shall take effect 
at the earliest possible date considering the lead time necessary to 
permit the development and application of the requisite technology, 
giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within that 
period and energy and safety.

  (e) Replacement by CARB Standards.--
          (1) Single set of carb standards.--If California promulgates 
        regulations establishing and implementing a single set of 
        standards applicable in California pursuant to a waiver 
        approved under section 221109 of this title to any category of 
        vehicles described in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) and that 
        set of standards is, in the aggregate, at least as protective 
        of public health and welfare as the otherwise applicable 
        standards set forth in section 225102 of this title and 
        subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), the California set of 
        standards shall apply to clean-fuel vehicles in that category 
        in lieu of the standards otherwise applicable under section 
        225102 of this title and subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), as 
        the case may be.
          (2) Multiple sets of carb standards.--If California 
        promulgates regulations establishing and implementing several 
        different sets of standards applicable in California pursuant 
        to a waiver approved under section 221109 of this title to any 
        category of vehicles described in subsection (a), (b), (c), or 
        (d) and each of the California sets of standards is, in the 
        aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare 
        as the otherwise applicable standards set forth in section 
        225102 of this title and subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), 
        those standards shall be treated as qualifying California 
        standards for purposes of this paragraph. Where more than 1 set 
        of qualifying standards are established and administered by 
        California, the least stringent set of qualifying California 
        standards shall apply to the clean-fuel vehicles concerned in 
        lieu of the standards otherwise applicable to those vehicles 
        under section 225102 of this title and this section.
  (f) Less Stringent CARB Standards.--If the Low-Emission Vehicle and 
Clean Fuels Regulations of the California Air Resources Board 
applicable to any category of vehicles described in subsection (a), 
(b), (c), or (d) are modified after November 15, 1990, to provide an 
emission standard that is less stringent than the otherwise applicable 
standard set forth in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d), or if any 
effective date contained in the regulations is delayed, the modified 
standards or the delay (or both, as the case may be) shall apply, for 
an interim period, in lieu of the standard or effective date otherwise 
applicable under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) to any vehicles 
covered by the modified standard or delayed effective date. The interim 
period shall be a period of not more than 2 model years after the 
effective date otherwise applicable under subsection (a), (b), (c), or 
(d). After the interim period, the otherwise applicable standard set 
forth in subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) shall take effect with 
respect to those vehicles (unless subsequently replaced under 
subsection (e)).
  (g) Nonapplicability to Heavy-Duty Vehicles.--Notwithstanding any 
provision of the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels Regulations of 
the California Air Resources Board, nothing in this section shall apply 
to heavy-duty engines in vehicles of more than 8,500 pounds gross 
vehicle weight rating.
Sec. 225104. Administration and enforcement as per California standards
  (a) In General.--Where the numerical clean-fuel vehicle standards 
applicable under this chapter to vehicles of not more than 8,500 pounds 
gross vehicle weight rating are the same as numerical emission 
standards applicable in California under the Low-Emission Vehicle and 
Clean Fuels Regulations of the California Air Resources Board, those 
standards shall be administered and enforced by the Administrator--
          (1) in the same manner and with the same flexibility as 
        California administers and enforces corresponding standards 
        applicable under the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuels 
        Regulations of the California Air Resources Board; and
          (2) subject to the same requirements, and utilizing the same 
        interpretations and policy judgments, as are applicable in the 
        case of the California standards, including requirements 
        regarding certification, production-line testing, and in-use 
        compliance;
unless the Administrator determines (in promulgating the regulations 
establishing the clean-fuel vehicle program under this section) that 
any such administration and enforcement would not meet the criteria for 
a waiver under section 221109 of this title.
  (b) Heavy-Duty Vehicles.--Nothing in this section shall apply in the 
case of standards under section 225105 of this title for heavy-duty 
vehicles.
Sec. 225105. Standards for heavy-duty clean-fuel vehicles of more than 
                    8,500 up to 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight 
                    rating
  (a) Combined Nitrogen Oxide and Nonmethane Hydrocarbon Standard.--For 
classes or categories of heavy-duty vehicles or engines having a gross 
vehicle weight rating greater than 8,500 pounds and up to 26,000 pounds 
gross vehicle weight rating, the standards under this chapter for 
clean-fuel vehicles shall require that combined emissions of nitrogen 
oxides and nonmethane hydrocarbons shall not exceed 3.15 grams per 
brake horsepower hour. No standard shall be promulgated under this 
section for any heavy-duty vehicle of more than 26,000 pounds gross 
vehicle weight rating.
  (b) Revised Standards That Are Less Stringent.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator may promulgate a revised 
        less stringent standard for the vehicles or engines described 
        in subsection (a) if the Administrator determines that the 50 
        percent reduction required under subsection (a) is not 
        technologically feasible for clean diesel-fueled vehicles and 
        engines, taking into account durability, costs, lead time, 
        safety, and other relevant factors.
          (2) Petition.--Any person may at any time petition the 
        Administrator to make a determination under paragraph (1). The 
        Administrator shall act on such a petition within 6 months 
        after the petition is filed.
          (3) Percentage reduction.--Any revised less stringent 
        standards promulgated under this subsection shall require at 
        least a 30 percent reduction in lieu of the 50 percent 
        reduction described in paragraph (1).
Sec. 225106. Centrally fueled fleets
  (a) Definition of Covered Area.--In this section:
          (1) In general.--The term ``covered area'' means--

                population of 250,000 or more classified under 
                subchapter II of chapter 215 as a serious area, severe 
                area, or extreme area based on data for calendar years 
                1987, 1988, and 1989; and
                  (B) a carbon monoxide nonattainment area with a 1980 
                population of 250,000 or more and a carbon monoxide 
                design value at or above 16.0 parts per million based 
                on data for calendar years 1988 and 1989.
          (2) Exclusion.--The term ``covered area'' does not include a 
        carbon monoxide nonattainment area in which mobile sources do 
        not contribute significantly to carbon monoxide exceedances.
          (3) Interpretation methodology.--In determining the areas to 
        be treated as covered areas under paragraph (1), the 
        Administrator shall use the most recent interpretation 
        methodology issued by the Administrator prior to November 15,

determines that amounts appropriated under subsection (g) are 
sufficient to provide for the incremental cost of such vehicles over 
the cost of comparable conventional vehicles.
  (c) Limitations on Appropriations.--Amounts appropriated under 
subsection (g) shall be applicable only to--
          (1) the portion of the costs of acquisition, maintenance, and 
        operation of clean-fuel vehicles that exceeds the cost of 
        acquisition, maintenance, and operation of comparable 
        conventional vehicles;
          (2) the portion of the costs of fuel storage and dispensing 
        equipment attributable to clean-fuel vehicles that exceeds the 
        costs for those purposes required for conventional vehicles; 
        and
          (3) the portion of the costs of acquisition of clean-fuel 
        vehicles that represents a reduction in revenue from the 
        disposal of clean-fuel vehicles as compared with revenue 
        resulting from the disposal of comparable conventional 
        vehicles.
  (d) Vehicle Costs.--The incremental cost of clean-fuel vehicles over 
the cost of comparable conventional vehicles shall not be applied to 
any calculation with respect to a limitation under law on the maximum 
cost of individual vehicles that may be required by the United States.

                manufacturers' projections of future sales of such 
                vehicles and consultations with the affected local 
                governments and fuel suppliers.
                  (D) Credits.--The State may by regulation grant 
                persons subject to the requirements prescribed under 
                this paragraph an appropriate amount of credits for 
                exceeding the requirements, and any person granted 
                credits may transfer some or all of the credits for use 
                by 1 or more persons in demonstrating compliance with 
                the requirements. The State may make the credits 
                available for use after consideration of 
                enforceability, environmental, and economic factors and 
                on such terms and conditions as the State finds 
                appropriate.
                  (E) Specifications.--The State may by regulation 
                establish specifications for any clean alternative fuel 
                produced and made available under this paragraph as the 
                State finds necessary to reduce or eliminate an 
                unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety 
                associated with its use or to ensure acceptable vehicle 
                maintenance and performance characteristics.
                  (F) Underground storage tanks.--If a retail gasoline 
                dispensing facility would have to remove or replace 1 
                or more motor vehicle fuel underground storage tanks 
                and accompanying piping to comply with this section, 
                and it had removed and replaced the tank or tanks and 
                accompanying piping to comply with subtitle I of the 
                Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq.) 
                before November 15, 1990, it shall not be required to 
                comply with this subsection until a period of 7 years 
                has passed from the date of the removal and replacement 
                of the tank or tanks.
                  (G) Effect of section.--Nothing in this section 
                authorizes any State other than California to adopt 
                provisions regarding clean alternative fuels.
                  (H) Failure of state to maintain clean air program.--
                If California fails to adopt a clean fuel program that

Sec. 233101. Findings and purposes
  (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
          (1) the presence of acidic compounds and their precursors in 
        the atmosphere and in deposition from the atmosphere represents 
        a threat to natural resources, ecosystems, materials, 
        visibility, and public health;
          (2) the principal sources of the acidic compounds and their 
        precursors in the atmosphere are emissions of sulfur and 
        nitrogen oxides from the combustion of fossil fuels;
          (3) the problem of acid deposition is of national and 
        international significance;
          (4) there exist strategies and technologies for the control 
        of precursors to acid deposition that are economically 
        feasible;
          (5) current and future generations of Americans would be 
        adversely affected by delaying measures to remedy the problem;
          (6) reduction of total atmospheric loading of sulfur dioxide 
        and nitrogen oxides will enhance protection of the public 
        health and welfare and the environment; and
          (7) steam-electric generating units should use control 
        measures to reduce precursor emissions.
  (b) Purposes.--
          (1) Emission reductions.--
                  (A) In general.--A purpose of this subdivision is to 
                reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition through 
                reductions in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide of 
                10,000,000 tons from 1980 emission levels, and, in 
                combination with other provisions of this division, of 
                nitrogen oxides emissions of approximately 2,000,000 
                tons from 1980 emission levels, in the 48 contiguous 
                States and the District of Columbia.
                  (B) Intent.--It is the intent of this subdivision to 
                effectuate the reductions described in subparagraph (A) 
                by requiring compliance by affected sources with 
                prescribed emission limitations by specified deadlines, 
                which limitations may be met through alternative 
                methods of compliance provided by an emission 
                allocation and transfer system.
          (2) Energy conservation, use of renewable and clean 
        alternative technologies, and pollution prevention.--A purpose 
        of this subdivision is to encourage energy conservation, use of 
        renewable and clean alternative technologies, and pollution 
        prevention as a long-range strategy, consistent with this 
        subdivision, for reducing air pollution and other adverse 
        impacts of energy production and use.

                allowances for such units for the calendar year 
                concerned.
  (d) New Utility Units.--It shall be unlawful for a new utility unit 
to emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess of the number of 
allowances to emit held for the unit by the unit's owner or operator. A 
new utility unit shall not be eligible for an allocation of sulfur 
dioxide allowances under subsection (a) unless the new utility unit is 
subject to paragraph (2) or (3) of section 233105(g) of this title. A 
new utility unit may obtain an allowance from any person in accordance 
with this subdivision. The owner or operator of any new utility unit in 
violation of this subsection shall be liable for fulfilling the 
obligations specified in section 233110 of this title.
  (e) Nature of Allowances.--
          (1) Limited authorization.--An allowance allocated under this 
        subdivision is a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide 
        in accordance with this subdivision.
          (2) Not a property right.--An allowance does not constitute a 
        property right.
          (3) No limitation on authority to terminate or limit 
        authorization.--Nothing in this subdivision or in any other 
        provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of 
        the United States to terminate or limit an allowance.
          (4) Other provisions.--Nothing in this section relating to 
        allowances shall be construed as affecting the application of 
        any other provision of this division (including provisions 
        relating to applicable NAAQSes and State implementation plans) 
        to, or compliance with any other such provision by, an affected 
        unit or affected source.
          (5) State law.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
        requiring a change of any kind in any State law regulating 
        electric utility rates and charges or affecting any State law 
        regarding such State regulation or as limiting State regulation 
        (including any prudency review) under such a State law.
          (6) Federal power act.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as modifying the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et 
        seq.) or as affecting the authority of the Federal Energy 
        Regulatory Commission under that Act.
          (7) Competitive bidding.--Nothing in this subdivision shall 
        be construed to interfere with or impair any program for 
        competitive bidding for power supply in a State in which the 
        program is established.
          (8) Permits.--An allowance, once allocated to a person by the 
        Administrator, may be received, held, and temporarily or 
        permanently transferred in accordance with this subdivision 
        (including the regulations of the Administrator) without regard 
        to whether a permit is in effect under subdivision 6 or section 
        233108 of this title with respect to the unit for which the 
        allowance was originally allocated and recorded. Each permit 
        under this subdivision and each permit issued under subdivision 
        6 for any affected unit shall provide that the affected unit 
        may not emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess of 
        the allowances held for that affected unit.
  (f) Prohibition.--
          (1) Holding, use, or transfer of allowance.--It shall be 
        unlawful for any person to hold, use, or transfer an allowance 
        allocated under this subdivision except in accordance with 
        regulations promulgated by the Administrator.
          (2) Emissions.--
                  (A) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any 
                affected unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the 
                number of allowances held for that affected unit for 
                that year by the owner or operator of the unit.
                  (B) Other emission limitations.--On the allocation of 
                allowances under this subdivision, the prohibition 
                contained in subparagraph (A) shall supersede any other 
                emission limitation applicable under this subdivision 
                to the units for which the allowances are allocated.
          (3) Calendar year for use.--An allowance may not be used 
        prior to the calendar year for which the allowance is 
        allocated.
          (4) Permitting, monitoring, and enforcement.--Nothing in this 
        section (including the allowance system regulations) shall--
                  (A) relieve the Administrator of the Administrator's 
                permitting, monitoring, and enforcement obligations 
                under this division; or
                  (B) relieve affected sources of their requirements 
                and liabilities under this division.
  (g) Competitive Bidding for Power Supply.--Nothing in this 
subdivision shall be construed to interfere with or impair any program 
for competitive bidding for power supply in a State in which such a 
program is established.
  (h) Applicability of Antitrust Laws.--
          (1) Definition of antitrust laws.--In this section, the term 
        ``antitrust laws'' has the meaning given the term in the 1st 
        section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).
          (2) Effect of section.--Nothing in this section affects--
                  (A) the applicability of the antitrust laws to the 
                transfer, use, or sale of an allowance; or
                  (B) the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
                Commission under any provision of law respecting unfair 
                methods of competition or anticompetitive acts or 
                practices.
Sec. 233104. Conservation and renewable energy reserve; alternative 
                    allowance allocation for units in certain utility 
                    systems with optional baseline
  (a) Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.--
          (1) Establishment.--The Administrator shall establish a 
        conservation and renewable energy reserve (referred to in this 
        subsection as the ``Reserve'').
          (2) Allocations.--The Administrator may allocate from the 
        Reserve an amount equal to a total of 300,000 allowances for 
        emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant to section 233103 of this 
        title.
          (3) Reduction of basic phase ii allowance allocation.--To 
        provide 300,000 allowances for the Reserve, in each year 
        through calendar year 2009, the Administrator shall reduce each 
        unit's basic Phase II allowance allocation on the basis of its 
        pro rata share of 30,000 allowances.
          (4) Remaining allowances.--If allowances remain in the 
        Reserve after January 2, 2010, the Administrator shall allocate 
        those allowances for affected units under section 233105 of 
        this title on a pro rata basis.
          (5) Pro rata basis.--For purposes of this subsection, for any 
        unit subject to the emission limitation requirements of section 
        233105 of this title, the term ``pro rata basis'' refers to the 
        ratio that--
                  (A) the reductions made in the unit's allowances to 
                establish the Reserve; bears to
                  (B) the total of such reductions for all such units.
  (b) Alternative Allowance Allocation for Units in Certain Utility 
Systems With Optional Baseline.--
          (1) Optional baseline for units in certain systems.--
                  (A) In general.--In the case of a unit described in 
                subparagraph (B), at the election of the owner or 
                operator of the unit made not later than March 1, 1991, 
                the unit's baseline may be calculated--
                          (i) as provided under section 233102(6) of 
                        this title; or
                          (ii) by utilizing the unit's average annual 
                        fuel consumption at a 60 percent capacity 
                        factor.
                  (B) Units.--A unit referred to in subparagraph (A) is 
                a unit that was subject to the emission limitation 
                requirements of section 404 of the Clean Air Act (42 
                U.S.C. 7651c) (as in effect before the repeal of that 
                section) that, as of November 15, 1990--
                          (i) had an emission rate below 1.0 pound per 
                        million British thermal units;
                          (ii) had decreased its sulfur dioxide 
                        emission rate by 60 percent or greater since 
                        1980; and
                          (iii) was part of a utility system that had a 
                        weighted average sulfur dioxide emission rate 
                        for all fossil fuel-fired units below 1.0 pound 
                        per million British thermal units.
          (2) Allowance allocation.--
                  (A) In general.--When the owner or operator of a unit 
                described in paragraph (1) elects to calculate the 
                unit's baseline as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), 
                the Administrator shall allocate allowances for the 
                unit pursuant to section 233103(a)(1) of this title, 
                this section, and section 233105 of this title (as 
                basic Phase II allowance allocations) in an amount 
                equal to--
                          (i) the baseline selected; multiplied by
                          (ii) the lower of--
                                  (I) the average annual emission rate 
                                for the unit in 1989; or
                                  (II) 1.0 pound per million British 
                                thermal units.
                  (B) Allowance in lieu of other allocation.--An 
                allowance allocation under subparagraph (A) shall be in 
                lieu of any allocation of allowances under this section 
                and section 233105 of this title.
Sec. 233105. Phase II sulfur dioxide requirements
  (a) Applicability.--
          (1) In general.--
                  (A) Existing units.--Each existing utility unit as 
                provided in this subsection is subject to the 
                limitations or requirements of this section.
                  (B) Affected units.--Each utility unit subject to an 
                annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation under 
                this section is an affected unit under this 
                subdivision.
                  (C) Affected sources.--Each source that includes 1 or 
                more affected units is an affected source.
                  (D) Existing units not in operation during 1985.--In 
                the case of an existing unit that was not in operation 
                during calendar year 1985, the emission rate for a 
                calendar year after 1985, as determined by the 
                Administrator, shall be used in lieu of the 1985 rate.
                  (E) Unit operated in violation of this section.--The 
                owner or operator of any unit operated in violation of 
                this section shall be fully liable under this chapter 
                for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 
                233110 of this title.
          (2) Allocation of phase ii bonus allowances.--
                  (A) Allocation.--In addition to basic Phase II 
                allowance allocations, in each year ending in calendar 
                year 2009, the Administrator shall allocate up to 
                530,000 Phase II bonus allowances pursuant to 
                subsections (b)(2) and (c)(4), subparagraphs (A) and 
                (B) of subsection (d)(3), and subsection (h)(2) and

                  (B) Calculation.--The Administrator shall--
                          (i) calculate, for each unit granted an 
                        extension pursuant to section 409 of the Clean 
                        Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7651h) (as in effect before 
                        the repeal of that section), the difference 
                        between--
                                  (I) the number of allowances 
                                allocated for the unit in calendar year 
                                2000; and
                                  (II)(aa) the unit's baseline; 
                                multiplied by
                                  (bb) 1.20 pounds per million British 
                                thermal units; divided by
                                  (cc) 2000; and
                          (ii) sum the calculations for all such units.
                  (C) Deduction.--In each year ending in calendar year 
                2009, the Administrator shall deduct from each unit's 
                basic Phase II allowance allocation its pro rata share 
                of 10 percent of the sum calculated pursuant to 
                subparagraph (B).
          (3) Additional allowances.--
                  (A) In general.--In addition to basic Phase II

                  (B) Allowances not subject to 8,900,000 ton 
                limitation.--Allowances allocated pursuant to this 
                paragraph shall not be subject to the 8,900,000 ton 
                limitation under section 223103(a) of this title.
  (b) Units Equal to or Greater Than 75 Megawatts Electric and 1.20 
Pounds Per Million British Thermal Units.--
          (1) General prohibition.--Except as otherwise provided in 
        paragraph (3), unless the owner or operator of the existing 
        utility unit holds allowances to emit not less than the 
        existing utility unit's total annual emissions, it shall be 
        unlawful for an existing unit that serves a generator with 
        nameplate capacity equal to, or greater, than 75 megawatts 
        electric and an actual 1985 sulfur dioxide emission rate equal 
        to or greater than 1.20 pounds per million British thermal 
        units to exceed an annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission 
        limitation equal to--
                  (A) the unit's baseline; multiplied by
                  (B) an emission rate equal to 1.20 pounds per million 
                British thermal units; divided by
                  (C) 2,000.
          (2) Additional allowances for units with an actual 1985 
        sulfur dioxide emission rate greater than 1.20 pounds per 
        million british thermal units and less than 2.50 pounds per 
        million british thermal units and a baseline capacity factor of 
        less than 60 percent.--In addition to allowances allocated 
        pursuant to paragraph (1) and section 233103(a) of this title 
        as basic Phase II allowance allocations, for each calendar year 
        through 2009, the Administrator shall allocate annually for 
        each unit subject to the emission limitation requirements of 
        paragraph (1) with an actual 1985 sulfur dioxide emission rate 
        greater than 1.20 pounds per million British thermal units and 
        less than 2.50 pounds per million British thermal units and a 
        baseline capacity factor of less than 60 percent, allowances 
        from the reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2) in an 
        amount equal to--
                  (A) 1.20 pounds per million British thermal units; 
                multiplied by
                  (B) 50 percent of the difference, on a British 
                thermal unit basis, between--
                          (i) the unit's baseline; and
                          (ii) the unit's fuel consumption at a 60 
                        percent capacity factor.
          (3) Prohibition applicable to certain units consuming lignite 
        coal.--Unless the owner or operator of the existing unit holds 
        allowances to emit not less than the existing unit's total 
        annual emissions, it shall be unlawful for an existing utility 
        unit with an actual 1985 sulfur dioxide emission rate equal to 
        or greater than 1.20 pounds per million British thermal units 
        whose annual average fuel consumption during 1985, 1986, and 
        1987 on a British thermal unit basis exceeded 90 percent in the 
        form of lignite coal located in a State in which, as of July 1, 
        1989, no county or portion of a county was designated 
        nonattainment under section 107 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
        7407) (as in effect on that date) for any pollutant subject to 
        the requirements of section 109 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
        7409) (as in effect on that date) to exceed an annual sulfur 
        dioxide tonnage limitation equal to--
                  (A) the unit's baseline; multiplied by
                  (B) the lesser of--
                          (i) the unit's actual 1985 sulfur dioxide 
                        emission rate; or
                          (ii) its allowable 1985 sulfur dioxide 
                        emission rate; divided by
                  (C) 2,000.
          (4) Allowances for certain units converted to coal.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall allocate 
                annually for each unit that is subject to the emission 
                limitation requirements of paragraph (1) and is located 
                in a State with an installed electrical generating 
                capacity of more than 30,000,000 kilowatts in 1988 and 
                for which was issued a prohibition order or a proposed 
                prohibition order (from burning oil), which unit 
                subsequently converted to coal between January 1, 1980, 
                and December 31, 1985, allowances equal to the 
                difference between--
                          (i)(I) the unit's annual fuel consumption, on 
                        a British thermal unit basis, at a 65 percent 
                        capacity factor; multiplied by
                          (II) the lesser of the unit's actual emission 
                        rate or allowable emission rate during the 1st 
                        full calendar year after conversion; divided by
                          (III) 2,000; and
                          (ii) the number of allowances allocated for 
                        the unit pursuant to paragraph (1).
                  (B) Restriction.--
                          (i) In general.--The number of allowances 
                        allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall not 
                        exceed an annual total of 5,000.
                          (ii) Reduction of allowance.--If necessary to 
                        meeting the restriction imposed by clause (i), 
                        the Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, the 
                        annual allowances allocated for each unit under 
                        this paragraph.
  (c) Coal- or Oil-Fired Units Below 75 Megawatts Electric and Above 
1.20 Pounds Per Million British Thermal Units.--
          (1) Utility operating companies with capacity equal to or 
        greater than 250 megawatts electric.--Except as provided in 
        paragraph (3), unless the owner or operator of the unit holds 
        allowances to emit not less than the unit's total annual 
        emissions, it shall be unlawful for a coal- or oil-fired 
        existing utility unit that serves a generator with nameplate 
        capacity of less than 75 megawatts electric and an actual 1985 
        sulfur dioxide emission rate equal to or greater than 1.20 
        pounds per million British thermal units and that is a unit 
        owned by a utility operating company whose aggregate nameplate 
        fossil fuel steam-electric capacity was, as of December 31, 
        1989, equal to or greater than 250 megawatts electric to exceed 
        an annual sulfur dioxide emission limitation equal to--
                  (A) the unit's baseline; multiplied by
                  (B) an emission rate equal to 1.20 pounds per million 
                British thermal units; divided by
                  (C) 2,000.
          (2) Utility operating companies with capacity of less than 
        250 megawatts electric.--Unless the owner or operator of the 
        unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total 
        annual emissions, it shall be unlawful for a coal or oil-fired 
        existing utility unit that serves a generator with nameplate 
        capacity of less than 75 megawatts electric and an actual 1985 
        sulfur dioxide emission rate equal to or greater than 1.20 
        pounds per million British thermal units (excluding units 
        subject to section 211111 of this title or to a federally 
        enforceable emission limitation for sulfur dioxide equivalent

Sec. 233107. Nitrogen oxide emission reduction program
  (a) Applicability.--A coal-fired utility unit that is an affected 
unit pursuant to section 233105 of this title is an affected unit for 
purposes of this section and shall be subject to the emission 
limitations for nitrogen oxides established under subsection (b).
  (b) Emission Limitations.--
          (1) Annual allowable emission limitations.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall by 
                regulation establish annual allowable emission 
                limitations for nitrogen oxides for the types of 
                utility boilers listed below, which limitations shall 
                not exceed--
                          (i) for tangentially fired boilers, 0.45 
                        pound per million British thermal units; or
                          (ii) for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other 
                        than units applying cell burner technology), 
                        0.50 pound per million British thermal units.
                  (B) Higher rate.--The Administrator may set a rate 
                higher than that listed for any type of utility boiler 
                if the Administrator finds that the maximum listed rate 
                for that boiler type cannot be achieved using low 
                nitrogen oxide burner technology.
                  (C) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any unit 
                that is an affected unit on January 1, 1995, and is of 
                the type listed in this paragraph to emit nitrogen 
                oxides in excess of the emission rates set by the 
                Administrator pursuant to this paragraph.
          (2) Allowable emission limitations on a pound per million 
        British thermal unit, annual average basis.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator shall by 
                regulation establish allowable emission limitations on 
                a pound per million British thermal unit, annual 
                average basis, for nitrogen oxides for the following 
                types of utility boilers:
                          (i) Wet bottom wall-fired boilers.
                          (ii) Cyclones.
                          (iii) Units applying cell burner technology.
                          (iv) All other types of utility boilers.
                  (B) Basis.--The Administrator shall base such rates 
                on the degree of reduction achievable through the 
                retrofit application of the best system of continuous 
                emission reduction, taking into account available 
                technology, costs, and energy and environmental 
                impacts, the costs of which are comparable to the costs 
                of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to subsection 
                (b)(1).
                  (C) Revision of applicable emission limitations for 
                tangentially fired and dry bottom, wall-fired boilers 
                (other than cell burners).--
                          (i) In general.--Not later than January 1, 
                        1997, the Administrator may revise the 
                        applicable emission limitations for 
                        tangentially fired and dry bottom wall-fired 
                        boilers (other than cell burners) to be more 
                        stringent if the Administrator determines that 
                        more effective low nitrogen oxide burner 
                        technology is available.
                          (ii) Limitation.--No unit that was an 
                        affected unit pursuant to section 404 of the 
                        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7651c) (as in effect 
                        before the repeal of that section) and that is 
                        subject to subsection (b)(1) shall be subject 
                        to the revised emission limitations under 
                        clause (i), if any.
  (c) Revised Performance Standards.--The Administrator shall 
promulgate revised standards of performance under section 211111 of 
this title for nitrogen oxides emissions from fossil fuel-fired steam 
generating units, including utility units and nonutility units. The 
revised standards of performance shall reflect improvements in methods 
for the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides.
  (d) Alternative Emission Limitations.--
          (1) In general.--A permitting authority shall, on request of 
        an owner or operator of a unit subject to this section, 
        authorize an emission limitation less stringent than the 
        applicable limitation established under subsection (b) on a 
        determination that--
                  (A) a unit subject to subsection (b)(1) cannot meet 
                the applicable limitation using low nitrogen oxide 
                burner technology; or
                  (B) a unit subject to subsection (b)(2) cannot meet 
                the applicable rate using the technology on which the 
                Administrator based the applicable emission limitation.
          (2) Basis.--The permitting authority shall base a 
        determination under paragraph (1) on a showing satisfactory to 
        the permitting authority, in accordance with regulations 
        established by the Administrator, that the owner or operator--
                  (A) has properly installed appropriate control 
                equipment designed to meet the applicable emission 
                rate;
                  (B) has properly operated the equipment for a period 
                of 15 months (or such other period of time as the 
                Administrator determines through the regulations), and 
                provides operating and monitoring data for that period 
                demonstrating that the unit cannot meet the applicable 
                emission rate; and
                  (C) has specified an emission rate that the unit can 
                meet on an annual average basis.
          (3) Operating permit.--The permitting authority--
                  (A) shall issue an operating permit for the unit in 
                accordance with section 233108 of this title and 
                subdivision 6 that permits the unit, during the 
                demonstration period described in paragraph (2)(B), to 
                emit at a rate in excess of the applicable emission 
                rate; and
                  (B) at the conclusion of the demonstration period, 
                shall revise the operating permit to reflect the 
                alternative emission rate demonstrated under 
                subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2).
          (4) No additional control technology.--A unit subject to 
        subsection (b)(1) for which an alternative emission limitation 
        is established shall not be required to install any control 
        technology except low nitrogen oxide burners.
          (5) Alternative nitrogen oxide control technology.--Nothing 
        in this section shall preclude an owner or operator from 
        installing and operating an alternative nitrogen oxide control 
        technology capable of achieving the applicable emission 
        limitation.
  (e) Emissions Averaging.--
          (1) In general.--In lieu of complying with the applicable 
        emission limitations under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection 
        (b) or under subsection (d), the owner or operator of 2 or more 
        units subject to 1 or more of the applicable emission 
        limitations set pursuant to those provisions may petition the 
        permitting authority for alternative contemporaneous annual 
        emission limitations for the units that ensure that the actual 
        annual emission rate in pounds of nitrogen oxides per million 
        British thermal units averaged over the units in question is a 
        rate that is less than or equal to the British thermal unit-
        weighted average annual emission rate for the same units if 
        they had been operated, during the same period of time, in 
        compliance with limitations set in accordance with the 
        applicable emission rates set pursuant to paragraphs (1) and 
        (2) of subsection (b).
          (2) Operating permits.--If the permitting authority 
        determines, in accordance with regulations issued by the 
        Administrator, that the conditions in paragraph (1) can be met, 
        the permitting authority shall issue operating permits for the 
        units in accordance with section 233108 of this title and 
        subdivision 6 that allow alternative contemporaneous annual 
        emission limitations. Such emission limitations shall remain in 
        effect only while both units continue operation under the 
        conditions specified in their respective operating permits.

        this subdivision for sources subject to this subdivision shall 
        be deemed to be compliance with this subsection and with 
        section 235102(a) of this title.
          (3) Reliability.--To ensure reliability of electric power, 
        nothing in this subdivision or subdivision 6 shall be construed 
        as requiring termination of operations of an electric utility 
        steam generating unit for failure to have an approved permit or 
        compliance plan, except that any such unit may be subject to 
        the applicable enforcement provisions of section 211113 of this 
        title.
  (i) Multiple Owners.--
          (1) In general.--No permit shall be issued under this section 
        to an affected unit until the designated representative of the 
        owner or operator has filed a certificate of representation 
        with regard to matters under this subdivision, including the 
        holding and distribution of allowances and the proceeds of 
        transactions involving allowances.
          (2) Multiple holders of title or leasehold interest; life-of-
        the-unit, firm power contractual arrangements.--
                  (A) In general.--Where there are multiple holders of 
                a legal or equitable title to, or a leasehold interest 
                in, an affected unit, or where a utility or industrial 
                customer purchases power from an affected unit (or 
                units) under life-of-the-unit, firm power contractual 
                arrangements, the certificate shall state--
                          (i) that allowances and the proceeds of 
                        transactions involving allowances will be 
                        deemed to be held or distributed in proportion 
                        to each holder's legal, equitable, leasehold, 
                        or contractual reservation or entitlement; or
                          (ii) if the multiple holders have expressly 
                        provided for a different distribution of 
                        allowances by contract, that allowances and the 
                        proceeds of transactions involving allowances 
                        will be deemed to be held or distributed in 
                        accordance with the contract.
                  (B) Passive lessors.--A passive lessor, or a person 
                that has an equitable interest through a passive 
                lessor, whose rental payments are not based, either 
                directly or indirectly, on the revenues or income from 
                the affected unit shall not be deemed to be a holder of 
                a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest 
                for the purpose of holding or distributing allowances 
                as provided in this subsection, during the term of the 
                leasehold or thereafter, unless expressly provided for 
                in the leasehold agreement.
                  (C) Single holder.--Except as otherwise provided in 
                this subsection, where all legal or equitable title to 
                or interest in an affected unit is held by a single 
                person, the certification shall state that all 
                allowances received by the unit are deemed to be held 
                for that person.
Sec. 233109. Election for additional sources
  (a) Applicability.--The owner or operator of any unit that is not, 
and will not become, an affected unit under section 233103(d) or 233105 
of this title, or that is a process source under subsection (d), that 
emits sulfur dioxide, may elect to designate that unit or source to 
become an affected unit and to receive allowances under this 
subdivision. An election shall be submitted to the Administrator for 
approval, with a permit application and proposed compliance plan in 
accordance with section 233108 of this title. The Administrator shall 
approve a designation that meets the requirements of this section, and 
the designated unit or source shall be allocated allowances and be an 
affected unit for purposes of this subdivision.
  (b) Establishment of Baseline.--The baseline for a unit designated 
under this section shall be established by the Administrator by 
regulation, based on fuel consumption and operating data for the unit 
for calendar years 1985, 1986, and 1987, or if such data are not 
available, the Administrator may prescribe a baseline based on 
alternative representative data.
  (c) Emission Limitations.--Annual emission limitations for sulfur 
dioxide shall be equal to--
          (1)(A) the baseline; multiplied by
          (B)(i) the lesser of the unit's actual 1985 sulfur dioxide 
        emission rate or allowable 1985 sulfur dioxide emission rate in 
        pounds per million British thermal units; or
          (ii) if the unit did not operate in 1985, the lesser of the 
        unit's actual emission rate or allowable emission rate for a 
        calendar year after 1985 (as determined by the Administrator); 
        divided by
          (2) 2,000.
  (d) Process Sources.--
          (1) In general.--The Administrator shall establish a program 
        under which the owner or operator of a process source that 
        emits sulfur dioxide may elect to designate that source as an 
        affected unit for the purpose of receiving allowances under 
        this subdivision.
          (2) Regulations.--The Administrator shall by regulation--
                  (A) define the sources that may be designated;
                  (B) specify the emission limitation;
                  (C) specify the operating, emission baseline, and 
                other data requirements;
                  (D) prescribe continuous emission monitoring system 
                or other monitoring requirements; and
                  (E) promulgate permit, reporting, and any other 
                requirements necessary to implement the program under 
                paragraph (1).
  (e) Allowances and Permits.--The Administrator shall issue allowances 
to an affected unit under this section in an amount equal to the 
emission limitation calculated under subsection (c) or (d), in 
accordance with section 233103 of this title. Such an allowance may be 
used in accordance with, and shall be subject to, section 233103 of 
this title. An affected source under this section shall be subject to 
the requirements of sections 233103, 233108, 233110, 233111, 233112, 
and 233113 of this title.
  (f) Limitation.--
          (1) In general.--Any unit designated under this section shall 
        not transfer or bank allowances produced as a result of reduced 
        utilization or shutdown, except that such allowances may be 
        transferred or carried forward for use in subsequent years to 
        the extent that--
                  (A) the reduced utilization or shutdown results from 
                the replacement of thermal energy from the unit 
                designated under this section with thermal energy 
                generated by any other unit or units subject to the 
                requirements of this subdivision; and
                  (B) the designated unit's allowances are transferred 
                or carried forward for use at the other replacement 
                unit or units.
          (2) No allowances in an amount greater than the emissions 
        resulting from operation of the source in full compliance.--In 
        no case may the Administrator allocate to a source designated 
        under this section allowances in an amount greater than the 
        emissions resulting from operation of the source in full 
        compliance with the requirements of this division.
          (3) No operation of unit in violation of other 
        requirements.--No such allowances shall authorize operation of 
        a unit in violation of any other requirements of this division.
  (g) Implementation.--The Administrator shall issue regulations to 
implement this section.
Sec. 233110. Excess emission penalty; excess emission offset
  (a) Excess Emissions Penalty.--
          (1) In general.--The owner or operator of any unit or process 
        source subject to the requirements of section 233103, 233105, 
        233106, or 233107 of this title, or designated under section 
        233109 of this title, that emits sulfur dioxide or nitrogen 
        oxides for any calendar year in excess of the unit's emission 
        limitation requirement or, in the case of sulfur dioxide, of 
        the allowances that the owner or operator holds for use for the 
        unit for that calendar year, shall be liable for the payment of 
        an excess emission penalty, except where the emissions are 
        authorized pursuant to section 211110(d) of this title.
          (2) Basis.--A penalty under paragraph (1) shall be calculated 
        on the basis of the number of tons emitted in excess of the 
        unit's emission limitation requirement or, in the case of 
        sulfur dioxide, of the allowances the operator holds for use 
        for the unit for that year, multiplied by $2,000.
          (3) Payment.--A penalty under paragraph (1) shall be due and 
        payable without demand to the Administrator as provided in 
        regulations issued by the Administrator.
          (4) Liability under other sections.--Any penalty under this 
        section shall not diminish the liability of the unit's owner or 
        operator for any fine, penalty, or assessment against a unit 
        for the same violation under any other section of this 
        division.
  (b) Excess Emission Offset.--
          (1) In general.--The owner or operator of any affected source 
        that emits sulfur dioxide during any calendar year in excess of 
        the unit's emission limitation requirement or of the allowances 
        held for the unit for the calendar year shall be liable to 
        offset the excess emission by an equal tonnage amount in the 
        following calendar year, or such longer period as the 
        Administrator may prescribe.
          (2) Plan to achieve offsets.--The owner or operator of the 
        source shall, within 60 days after the end of the year in which 
        the excess emission occurred, submit to the Administrator, and 
        to the State in which the source is located, a proposed plan to 
        achieve the required offsets. On approval of the proposed plan 
        by the Administrator, as submitted, modified, or conditioned, 
        the plan shall be deemed to be a condition of the operating 
        permit for the unit without further review or revision of the 
        permit.
          (3) Deduction of allowances.--In addition to requiring a plan 
        under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall deduct allowances 
        equal to the excess tonnage from those allocated for the source 
        for the calendar year, or succeeding years during which offsets 
        are required, following the year in which the excess emission 
        occurred.
  (c) Penalty Adjustment.--The Administrator shall annually by 
regulation adjust the penalty specified in subsection (a) for 
inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index as of November 15, 1990.
  (d) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of 
any source liable for a penalty and offset under this section to fail 
to--
          (1) pay a penalty under subsection (a);
          (2) provide, and thereafter comply with, a compliance plan as 
        required by subsection (b); or
          (3) offset an excess emission as required by subsection (b).
  (e) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this subdivision shall limit or 
otherwise affect the application of section 203104, 211113, 211114, or 
211119 of this title except as otherwise explicitly provided in this 
subdivision.

        data or data from an alternative monitoring system approved by 
        the Administrator under subsection (a) are not available for 
        any affected unit during any period of a calendar year in which 
        the data are required under this subdivision, and the owner or 
        operator cannot provide information, satisfactory to the 
        Administrator, on emissions during that period, the 
        Administrator--
                  (A) shall deem the unit to be operating in an 
                uncontrolled manner during the entire period for which 
                the data were not available; and
                  (B) shall by regulation prescribe means to calculate 
                emissions for that period.
          (2) Excess emission fees and offsets.--The owner or operator 
        shall be liable for excess emission fees and offsets under 
        section 233110 of this title in accordance with the 
        regulations.
          (3) Liability under other sections.--Any fee due and payable 
        under this subsection shall not diminish the liability of the 
        unit's owner or operator for any fine, penalty, fee, or 
        assessment against the unit for the same violation under any 
        other section of this division.
  (d) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of 
an affected source to operate a source without complying with the 
requirements of this section (including any regulations implementing 
this section).
Sec. 233112. General compliance with other provisions
  Except as expressly provided, compliance with the requirements of 
this subdivision shall not exempt or exclude the owner or operator of 
an affected source from compliance with any other applicable 
requirements of this division.
Sec. 233113. Enforcement
  In addition to the other requirements and prohibitions provided for 
in this subdivision, the operation of any affected unit to emit sulfur 
dioxide in excess of allowances held for the unit shall be deemed a 
violation, with each ton emitted in excess of allowances held 
constituting a separate violation.

                the direct sale subaccount shall be approved in the 
                order of receipt until no allowances remain in the 
                subaccount, except that an opportunity to purchase such 
                allowances shall be provided to independent power 
                producers before the allowances are offered to any

        units from which the allowances were withheld under subsection 
        (b) and that any unsold allowances be transferred to the

        consecutive calendar years, fewer than 20 percent of the 
        allowances available in the direct sale subaccount have been 
        purchased under this paragraph, the Administrator shall

                starting with the highest bid and continuing until all 
                allowances for sale at an auction have been allocated. 
                The regulations shall not permit a minimum price to be 
                set for the purchase of withheld allowances.

                proceeds from the auction under this section, on a pro 
                rata basis, to the owners or operators of the affected 
                units at an affected source from which allowances were 
                withheld under subsection (b). No funds transferred 
                from a purchaser to a seller of allowances under this 
                paragraph shall be held by any officer or employee of 
                the United States or treated for any purpose as revenue 
                to the United States or the Administrator.
                  (B) Allowances not sold.--At the end of each year, 
                any allowances offered for sale but not sold at the 
                auction shall be returned without charge, on a pro rata 
                basis, to the owner or operator of the affected units 
                from whose allocation the allowances were withheld.
          (4) Additional auction participants.--Any person holding 
        allowances or to which allowances are allocated by the 
        Administrator may submit the allowances to the Administrator to 
        be offered for sale at auction under this subsection. The 
        proceeds of any such sale shall be transferred at the time of 
        sale by the purchaser to the person submitting the allowances 
        for sale. The holder of allowances offered for sale under this 
        paragraph may specify a minimum sale price. Any person may 
        purchase allowances offered for auction under this paragraph. 
        The allowances shall be allocated and sold to purchasers on the 
        basis of bid price after the auction under paragraph (2) is 
        complete. No funds transferred from a purchaser to a seller of 
        allowances under this paragraph shall be held by any officer or 
        employee of the United States or treated for any purpose as 
        revenue to the United States or the Administrator.
          (5) Recordation by epa.--The Administrator shall record and 
        publicly report the nature, prices, and results of each auction 
        under this subsection, including the prices of successful bids, 
        and shall record the transfers of allowances as a result of 
        each auction in accordance with the requirements of this 
        section. The transfer of allowances at the auction shall be 
        recorded in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the 
        Administrator under this subdivision.
          (6) Termination of auctions.--If the Administrator determines 
        that, during any period of 3 consecutive calendar years, fewer 
        than 20 percent of the allowances available in the auction 
        subaccount have been purchased, the Administrator may terminate 
        the withholding of allowances and the auction sales under this 
        section.
  (e) Changes in Sales, Auctions, and Withholding.--Pursuant to 
rulemaking after public notice and comment, the Administrator may at 
any time decrease the number of allowances withheld and sold under this 
section.

Agencies or by Nongovernmental Agencies, Groups, or Organizations.--
Pursuant to regulations under this section, the Administrator may by

                appropriate, subdivision 5) shall be treated as a final 
                permit action solely for purposes of obtaining judicial 
                review in State court of an action brought by any 
                person described in subparagraph (F)(iv) to require 
                that action be taken by the permitting authority on the 
                application without additional delay.
                  (H) Authority, and reasonable procedures consistent 
                with the need for expeditious action by a permitting 
                authority on permit applications and related matters, 
                to make available to the public any permit application, 
                compliance plan, permit, and monitoring or compliance 
                report under section 235103(e) of this title, subject 
                to section 211114(c) of this title.
                  (I) A requirement that a permitting authority, in the 
                case of a permit with a term of 3 or more years for a 
                major source, shall require revisions to the permit to 
                incorporate applicable standards and regulations 
                promulgated under this division after the issuance of 
                the permit.
                  (J) Provisions to allow changes within a permitted 
                facility (or a facility operating pursuant to section 
                235103(d) of this title) without requiring a permit 
                revision, if--
                          (i) the changes are not modifications under 
                        any provision of subdivision 2;
                          (ii) the changes do not exceed the emissions 
                        allowable under the permit (whether expressed 
                        in the permit as a rate of emissions or in 
                        terms of total emissions); and
                          (iii) the facility provides the Administrator 
                        and the permitting authority with written 
                        notification in advance of the proposed changes 
                        (which shall be a minimum of 7 days unless the 
                        permitting authority provides in its 
                        regulations a different timeframe for 
                        emergencies).
          (3) Fee program.--
                  (A) Definition of regulated pollutant.--In this 
                paragraph, the term ``regulated pollutant'' means--
                          (i) a volatile organic compound;
                          (ii) a pollutant regulated under section 
                        211111 or 211112 of this title; and
                          (iii) a pollutant for which a primary NAAQS 
                        has been promulgated (not including carbon 
                        monoxide).
                  (B) Amount collected.--The total amount of fees 
                collected by a permitting authority under paragraph 
                (2)(C) shall conform to the following requirements:
                          (i) Adequate reflection of reasonable 
                        costs.--The Administrator shall not approve a 
                        program as meeting the requirements of this 
                        paragraph unless the State demonstrates that, 
                        except as otherwise provided in clauses (ii) 
                        through (iv), the program will result in the 
                        collection, in the aggregate, from all sources 
                        subject to paragraph (2)(C), of an amount not 
                        less than $25 per ton of each regulated 
                        pollutant, or such other amount as the 
                        Administrator may determine adequately reflects 
                        the reasonable costs of the permit program.
                          (ii) Exclusion of emissions in excess of 
                        4,000 tons per year.--In determining the amount 
                        under clause (i), a permitting authority is not 
                        required to include any amount of regulated 
                        pollutant emitted by any source in excess of 
                        4,000 tons per year of the regulated pollutant.
                          (iii) Lesser amount meeting requirements.--
                        The requirements of clause (i) shall not apply 
                        if the permitting authority demonstrates that 
                        collecting an amount less than the amount 
                        specified under clause (i) will meet the 
                        requirements of paragraph (2)(C).
                          (iv) Annual increase.--
                                  (I) In general.--The fee calculated 
                                under clause (i) shall be increased 
                                (consistent with the need to cover the 
                                reasonable costs authorized by 
                                paragraph (2)(C)) in each year by the 
                                percentage, if any, by which the 
                                Consumer Price Index for the most 
                                recent calendar year ending before the 
                                beginning of the year exceeds the 
                                Consumer Price Index for the calendar 
                                year 1989.
                                  (II) Consumer price index.--For 
                                purposes of this clause--
                                          (aa) the Consumer Price Index 
                                        for any calendar year is the 
                                        average of the Consumer Price 
                                        Index for all-urban consumers 
                                        published by the Department of 
                                        Labor, as of the close of the 
                                        12-month period ending on 
                                        August 31 of each calendar 
                                        year; and
                                          (bb) the revision of the 
                                        Consumer Price Index that is 
                                        most consistent with the 
                                        Consumer Price Index for 
                                        calendar year 1989 shall be 
                                        used.
                  (C) Collection by the administrator.--
                          (i) In general.--If the Administrator 
                        determines under subsection (d) that the fee 
                        provisions of the operating permit program do 
                        not meet the requirements of paragraph (2)(C), 
                        or if the Administrator makes a determination 
                        under subsection (i) that a permitting 
                        authority is not adequately administering or 
                        enforcing an approved fee program, the 
                        Administrator may, in addition to taking any 
                        other action authorized under this subdivision, 
                        collect reasonable fees from the sources 
                        identified under paragraph (2)(C). The fees 
                        shall be designed solely to cover the 
                        Administrator's costs of administering the 
                        provisions of the permit program promulgated by 
                        the Administrator.
                          (ii) Penalty.--A source that fails to pay a 
                        fee lawfully imposed by the Administrator under 
                        this subparagraph shall pay a penalty of 50 
                        percent of the fee amount, plus interest on the 
                        fee amount computed in accordance with section 
                        6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
                        (26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2)).
                          (iii) Special fund.--Any fees, penalties, and 
                        interest collected under this subparagraph 
                        shall be deposited in the Treasury in a special 
                        fund for licensing and other services, which 
                        thereafter shall be available for 
                        appropriation, to remain available until 
                        expended, subject to appropriation, to carry 
                        out EPA's activities for which the fees were 
                        collected.
                  (D) Fee required to be collected by a state, local, 
                or interstate agency.--Any fee required to be collected 
                by a State, local, or interstate agency under this 
                subsection shall be utilized solely to cover all 
                reasonable (direct and indirect) costs required to 
                support the permit program as set forth in paragraph 
                (2)(C).
          (4) Permit revisions.--A revision required by paragraph 
        (2)(I) shall be made as expeditiously as practicable and 
        consistent with the procedures established under paragraph 
        (2)(F) but not later than 18 months after the promulgation of 
        standards and regulations described in paragraph (2)(I). No 
        such revision shall be required if the effective date of the 
        standards or regulations is a date after the expiration of the 
        permit term. Such a permit revision shall be treated as a 
        permit renewal if it complies with the requirements of this 
        subdivision regarding renewals.
  (c) Single Permit.--A single permit may be issued for a facility with 
multiple sources.
  (d) Submission; Approval or Disapproval.--
          (1) Submission.--The Governor of each State shall develop and 
        submit to the Administrator--
                  (A) a permit program under State or local law or 
                under an interstate compact meeting the requirements of 
                this subdivision; and
                  (B) a legal opinion from the attorney general (or the 
                attorney for a State air pollution control agency that 
                has independent legal counsel, or from the chief legal 
                officer of an interstate agency), that the laws of the 
                State or locality provide or the interstate compact 
                provides adequate authority to carry out the program.
          (2) Approval or disapproval.--Not later than 1 year after 
        receiving a program, and after notice and opportunity for 
        public comment, the Administrator shall approve or disapprove 
        the program, in whole or in part. The Administrator may approve 
        a program to the extent that the program meets the requirements 
        of this division, including the regulations issued under 
        subsection (b). If the program is disapproved, in whole or in 
        part, the Administrator shall notify the Governor of any 
        revisions or modifications necessary to obtain approval. The 
        Governor shall revise and resubmit the program for review under 
        this section within 180 days after receiving notification.
  (e) Administration and Enforcement.--
          (1) Discretionary sanctions.--Whenever the Administrator 
        makes a determination that a permitting authority is not 
        adequately administering and enforcing a program, or portion 
        thereof, in accordance with the requirements of this 
        subdivision, the Administrator--
                  (A) shall provide notice to the State; and
                  (B) may, prior to the date that is 18 months after 
                the date of the notice under subparagraph (A), apply 
                any of the sanctions specified in section 215111(b) of 
                this title.
          (2) Mandatory sanctions.--Whenever the Administrator makes a 
        determination that a permitting authority is not adequately 
        administering and enforcing a program, or portion thereof, in 
        accordance with the requirements of this subdivision, on the 
        date that is 18 months after the date of the notice under 
        paragraph (1)(A), the Administrator shall apply the sanctions 
        under section 215111(b) of this title in the same manner and 
        subject to the same deadlines and other conditions as are 
        applicable in the case of a determination, disapproval, or 
        finding under section 215111(a) of this title.
          (3) Applicability of sanctions in nonattainment areas only.--
        The sanctions under section 215111(b)(3) of this title shall 
        not apply pursuant to this subsection in any area unless the 
        failure to adequately enforce and administer the program 
        relates to an air pollutant for which the area has been 
        designated a nonattainment area.
          (4) Promulgation, administration, and enforcement of permit 
        program by the administrator.--When the Administrator makes a 
        finding under paragraph (1) with respect to a State, unless the 
        State corrects the deficiency within 18 months after the date 
        of the finding, the Administrator shall, 2 years after the date 
        of the finding, promulgate, administer, and enforce a program 
        under this subdivision for the State. Nothing in this paragraph 
        shall be construed to affect the validity of a program that has 
        been approved under this subdivision or the authority of any 
        permitting authority acting under such a program until such 
        time as a program is promulgated by the Administrator under 
        this paragraph.
Sec. 235103. Permit applications
  (a) Applicable Date.--Any source specified in section 235102(a) of 
this title shall become subject to a permit program, and required to 
have a permit, on the later of--
          (1) the effective date of a permit program or partial or 
        interim permit program applicable to the source; or
          (2) the date on which the source becomes subject to section 
        235102(a) of this title.
  (b) Compliance Plan.--
          (1) In general.--The regulations required by section 
        235102(b) of this title shall include a requirement that the 
        applicant submit with the permit application a compliance plan 
        describing how the source will comply with all applicable 
        requirements under this chapter. The compliance plan shall 
        include a schedule of compliance and a schedule under which the 
        permittee will submit progress reports to the permitting 
        authority not less frequently than every 6 months.
          (2) Certification; reporting.--The regulations required by 
        section 235102(b) of this title shall require the permittee 
        to--
                  (A) periodically (but not less frequently than 
                annually) certify that the facility is in compliance 
                with any applicable requirements of the permit; and
                  (B) promptly report any deviations from permit 
                requirements to the permitting authority.
  (c) Deadlines.--Any person required to have a permit shall, not later 
than 12 months after the date on which the source becomes subject to a 
permit program approved or promulgated under this subdivision, or such 
earlier date as the permitting authority may establish, submit to the 
permitting authority a compliance plan and an application for a permit 
signed by a responsible official, who shall certify the accuracy of the 
information submitted. The permitting authority shall approve or 
disapprove a completed application (consistent with the procedures 
established under this subdivision for consideration of such 
applications), and shall issue or deny the permit, within 18 months 
after the date of receipt of the completed application, except that the 
permitting authority shall establish a phased schedule for acting on 
permit applications submitted within the 1st full year after the 
effective date of a permit program (or a partial or interim program). 
Any such schedule shall ensure that at least \1/3\ of the permits are 
acted on by the permitting authority annually over a period of not to 
exceed 3 years after such effective date. The permitting authority 
shall establish reasonable procedures to prioritize such approval or 
disapproval actions in the case of applications for construction or 
modification under the applicable requirements of this division.
  (d) Timely and Complete Applications.--Except for sources required to 
have a permit before construction or modification under the applicable 
requirements of this division, if an applicant has submitted a timely 
and complete application for a permit required by this subdivision 
(including renewals), but final action has not been taken on the 
application, the source's failure to have a permit shall not be a 
violation of this division unless the delay in final action was due to 
the failure of the applicant timely to submit information required or 
requested to process the application. No source required to have a 
permit under this subdivision shall be in violation of section 
235102(a) of this title before the date on which the source is required 
to submit an application under subsection (c).
  (e) Copies; Availability.--A copy of each permit application, 
compliance plan (including the schedule of compliance), emission or 
compliance monitoring report, certification, and permit issued under 
this subdivision shall be available to the public. If an applicant or 
permittee is required to submit information entitled to protection from 
disclosure under section 211114(c) of this title, the applicant or 
permittee may submit the information separately. The requirements of 
section 211114(c) of this title shall apply to the information. The 
contents of a permit shall not be entitled to protection under section 
211114(c) of this title.
Sec. 235104. Permit requirements and conditions
  (a) Conditions.--Each permit issued under this subdivision shall 
include--
          (1) enforceable emission limitations and standards;
          (2) a schedule of compliance;
          (3) a requirement that the permittee submit to the permitting 
        authority, not less often than every 6 months, the results of 
        any required monitoring; and
          (4) such other conditions as are necessary to ensure 
        compliance with applicable requirements of this division, 
        including the requirements of the applicable implementation 
        plan.
  (b) Monitoring and Analysis.--The Administrator may by regulation 
prescribe procedures and methods for determining compliance and for 
monitoring and analysis of pollutants regulated under this division, 
but continuous emission monitoring need not be required if alternative 
methods are available that provide sufficiently reliable and timely 
information for determining compliance. Nothing in this subsection 
shall be construed to affect any continuous emissions monitoring 
requirement of subdivision 5, or where required elsewhere in this 
division.
  (c) Inspection, Entry, Monitoring, Certification, and Reporting.--
Each permit issued under this subdivision shall set forth inspection, 
entry, monitoring, compliance certification, and reporting requirements 
to ensure compliance with the permit terms and conditions. The 
monitoring and reporting requirements shall conform to any applicable 
regulation under subsection (b). Any report required to be submitted by 
a permit issued to a corporation under this subdivision shall be signed 
by a responsible corporate official, who shall certify its accuracy.
  (d) General Permits.--A permitting authority may, after notice and 
opportunity for public hearing, issue a general permit covering 
numerous similar sources. Any general permit shall comply with all 
requirements applicable to permits under this subdivision. No source 
covered by a general permit shall thereby be relieved from the 
obligation to file an application under section 235103 of this title.
  (e) Temporary Sources.--A permitting authority may issue a single 
permit authorizing emissions from similar operations at multiple 
temporary locations. No such permit shall be issued unless it includes 
conditions that will ensure compliance with all the requirements of 
this division at all authorized locations, including ambient standards 
and compliance with any applicable increment or visibility requirements 
under chapter 213. Any such permit shall require the owner or operator 
to notify the permitting authority in advance of each change in 
location. The permitting authority may require a separate permit fee 
for operations at each location.
  (f) Permit Shield.--
          (1) In general.--Compliance with a permit issued in 
        accordance with this subdivision shall be deemed compliance

                  (A) In general.--Except as otherwise provided by the 
                Administrator by regulation, the permit may provide 
                that compliance with the permit shall be deemed 
                compliance with other applicable provisions of this 
                division that relate to the permittee if--
                          (i) the permit includes the applicable 
                        requirements of such provisions; or
                          (ii) the permitting authority in acting on 
                        the permit application makes a determination 
                        relating to the permittee that such other 
                        provisions (which shall be referred to in the 
                        determination) are not applicable and the 
                        permit includes the determination or a concise 
                        summary of the determination.
                  (B) Effect of subparagraph.--Nothing in subparagraph 
                (A) shall alter or affect section 203103 of this title, 
                including the authority of the Administrator under that 
                section.
Sec. 235105. Notification to Administrator and contiguous States
  (a) Transmission and Notice.--
          (1) Copies of permit application and proposed permit to the 
        administrator.--A permitting authority shall--
                  (A) transmit to the Administrator a copy of each 
                permit application (and any application for a permit 
                modification or renewal) or such portion thereof, 
                including any compliance plan, as the Administrator may 
                require to effectively review the application and 
                otherwise to carry out the Administrator's 
                responsibilities under this division; and
                  (B) provide the Administrator a copy of each permit 
                proposed to be issued and issued as a final permit.
          (2) Notification to states.--
                  (A) Notification.--A permitting authority shall 
                notify all States--
                          (i) whose air quality may be affected and 
                        that are contiguous to the State in which the 
                        emission originates; or
                          (ii) that are within 50 miles of the source;
                of each permit application or proposed permit forwarded 
                to the Administrator under this section.
                  (B) Recommendations.--A permitting authority shall 
                provide an opportunity for States described in 
                subparagraph (A) to submit written recommendations 
                respecting the issuance of the permit and its terms and 
                conditions. If any part of those recommendations is not 
                accepted by the permitting authority, the permitting 
                authority shall notify the State submitting the 
                recommendations and the Administrator in writing of its 
                decision not to accept that part of the recommendation 
                and the reasons for the decision.
  (b) Permit Provision Not in Compliance.--
          (1) Objection by the administrator.--
                  (A) In general.--If a permit contains provisions that 
                are determined by the Administrator to be not in 
                compliance with the applicable requirements of this 
                division (including the requirements of an applicable 
                implementation plan), the Administrator shall, in 
                accordance with this subsection, object to issuance of 
                the permit.
                  (B) Response.--The permitting authority shall respond 
                in writing if the Administrator--
                          (i) within 45 days after receiving a copy of 
                        the proposed permit under subsection (a)(1); or
                          (ii) within 45 days after receiving 
                        notification under subsection (a)(2);
                objects in writing to issuance of a permit as not in 
                compliance with the requirements.
                  (C) Reasons.--With the objection, the Administrator 
                shall provide a statement of the reasons for the 
                objection.
                  (D) Copies to applicant.--A copy of the objection and 
                statement shall be provided to the applicant.
          (2) No objection by the administrator.--
                  (A) Petition.--If the Administrator does not object 
                in writing to the issuance of a permit pursuant to 
                paragraph (1), any person may petition the 
                Administrator within 60 days after the expiration of 
                the 45-day review period specified in paragraph (1) to 
                make an objection. A copy of the petition shall be 
                provided to the permitting authority and the applicant 
                by the petitioner. The petition shall be based only on 
                objections to the permit that were raised with 
                reasonable specificity during the public comment period 
                provided by the permitting agency (unless the 
                petitioner demonstrates in the petition to the 
                Administrator that it was impracticable to raise the 
                objections within that period or unless the grounds for 
                the objection arose after that period). The petition 
                shall identify all such objections. If the permit has 
                been issued by the permitting agency, the petition 
                shall not postpone the effectiveness of the permit.
                  (B) Grant or denial.--The Administrator shall grant 
                or deny a petition under subparagraph (A) within 60 
                days after the petition is filed. The Administrator 
                shall issue an objection within that period if the 
                petitioner demonstrates to the Administrator that the 
                permit is not in compliance with the requirements of 
                this division (including the requirements of an 
                applicable implementation plan). Any denial of such a 
                petition shall be subject to judicial review under 
                section 211113 of this title.
                  (C) Regulations.--The Administrator shall include in 
                regulations under this subdivision provisions to 
                implement this paragraph.
                  (D) Nondelegability.--The Administrator may not 
                delegate the requirements of this paragraph.
          (3) Revision of permit.--
                  (A) In general.--On receipt of an objection by the 
                Administrator under this subsection, a permitting 
                authority may not issue a permit unless the permit is 
                revised and issued in accordance with subsection (c).
                  (B) Objection on petition.--If the permitting 
                authority has issued a permit prior to receipt of an 
                objection by the Administrator under paragraph (2)--
                          (i) the Administrator shall modify, 
                        terminate, or revoke the permit; and
                          (ii) the permitting authority may thereafter 
                        issue a revised permit only in accordance with 
                        subsection (c).
  (c) Issuance or Denial.--If the permitting authority fails, within 90 
days after the date of an objection under subsection (b), to submit a 
permit revised to meet the objection, the Administrator shall issue or 
deny the permit in accordance with the requirements of this 
subdivision. No objection shall be subject to judicial review until the 
Administrator takes final action to issue or deny a permit under this 
subsection.
  (d) Waiver of Notification Requirements.--
          (1) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive the requirements of 
        subsections (a) and (b) at the time of approval of a permit 
        program under this subdivision for any category (including any 
        class, type, or size within such category) of sources covered 
        by the program other than major sources.
          (2) Categories of sources.--The Administrator may by 
        regulation establish categories of sources (other than major 
        sources), including establishment of any class, type, or size 
        within a category, to which the requirements of subsections (a) 
        and (b) shall not apply.
          (3) Exclusion from waiver.--The Administrator may exclude 
        from any waiver under this subsection the notification 
        requirement under subsection (a)(2).
          (4) Revocation or modification.--Any waiver granted under 
        this subsection may be revoked or modified by the Administrator 
        by regulation.
  (e) Termination, Modification, or Revocation and Reissuance of 
Permit.--
          (1) Notification to permitting authority and source.--If the 
        Administrator finds that cause exists to terminate, modify, or 
        revoke and reissue a permit under this subdivision, the 
        Administrator shall notify the permitting authority and the 
        source of the Administrator's finding.
          (2) Proposed determination.--The permitting authority shall, 
        within 90 days after receipt of notification under paragraph 
        (1), submit to the Administrator a proposed determination of 
        termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as 
        appropriate. The Administrator may extend the 90-day period for 
        an additional 90 days if the Administrator finds that a new or 
        revised permit application is necessary or that the permitting 
        authority must require the permittee to submit additional 
        information. The Administrator may review the proposed 
        determination in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).
          (3) Action by the administrator.--If the permitting authority 
        fails to submit the required proposed determination, or if the 
        Administrator objects and the permitting authority fails to 
        resolve the objection within 90 days, the Administrator may, 
        after notice and in accordance with fair and reasonable 
        procedures, terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the 
        permit.

                be consistent with the Montreal Protocol.
Sec. 237103. Monitoring and reporting requirements
  (a) Regulations.--The regulations of the Administrator regarding 
monitoring and reporting of class I substances and class II substances 
shall conform to the requirements of this section. The regulations 
shall include requirements with respect to the time and manner of 
monitoring and reporting as required under this section.
  (b) Production, Import, and Export Level Reports.--On a quarterly 
basis, or such other basis (not less than annually) as the 
Administrator may determine, each person that produces, imports, or 
exports a class I substance or class II substance shall file a report 
with the Administrator setting forth the amount of the substance that 
the person produced, imported, and exported during the preceding 
reporting period. Each such report shall be signed and attested by a 
responsible officer. No such report shall be required from a person 
after April 1 of the calendar year after the person permanently ceases 
production, importation, and exportation of the substance and so 
notifies the Administrator in writing.
  (c) Baseline Reports for Class I Substances.--Unless such information 
has previously been reported to the Administrator, on the date on which 
the 1st report under subsection (b) is required to be filed, each 
person that produces, imports, or exports a class I substance (other 
than a substance added to the list of class I substances after the 
publication of the initial list of class I substances under this 
section) shall file a report with the Administrator setting forth the 
amount of the class I substance that the person produced, imported, and 
exported during the baseline year. In the case of a substance added to 
the list of class I substances after publication of the initial list of 
class I substances under this section, the regulations shall require 
that each person that produced, imported, or exported the class I 
substance shall file a report with the Administrator within 180 days 
after the date on which the class I substance is added to the list, 
setting forth the amount of the class I substance that the person 
produced, imported, and exported in the baseline year.
  (d) Monitoring and Reports to Congress.--
          (1) Production, use, and consumption of class i substances 
        and class ii substances.--The Administrator shall monitor the 
        production, use, and consumption of class I substances and

        and economic effects of any stratospheric ozone depletion.
          (2) Tropospheric concentration of chlorine and bromine and 
        level of stratospheric ozone depletion.--
                  (A) In general.--The Administrator of the National 
                Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
                Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
                Administration shall monitor, and not less often than 
                every 3 years submit to Congress a report on, the 
                current average tropospheric concentration of chlorine 
                and bromine and the level of stratospheric ozone 
                depletion.
                  (B) Contents.--A report under subparagraph (A) shall 
                include updated projections of--
                          (i) peak chlorine loading;
                          (ii) the rate at which the atmospheric 
                        abundance of chlorine is projected to decrease; 
                        and
                          (iii) the date by which the atmospheric 
                        abundance of chlorine is projected to return to 
                        a level of 2 parts per billion.
                  (C) Basis of projections.--Updated projections under 
                subparagraph (B) shall be made on the basis of--
                          (i) current international and domestic 
                        controls on substances covered by this 
                        subdivision; and
                          (ii) controls described in clause (i) 
                        supplemented by a year 2000 global phaseout of 
                        all halocarbon emissions (the base case).
                  (D) Purpose.--It is the purpose of Congress through 
                this section to monitor closely the production and 
                consumption of class II substances to ensure that the 
                production and consumption of class II substances will 
                not--
                          (i) increase significantly the peak chlorine 
                        loading that is projected to occur under the 
                        base case established for purposes of this 
                        section;
                          (ii) reduce significantly the rate at which 
                        the atmospheric abundance of chlorine is 
                        projected to decrease under the base case; or
                          (iii) delay the date by which the average 
                        atmospheric concentration of chlorine is 
                        projected under the base case to return to a 
                        level of 2 parts per billion.
  (e) Technology Status Report in 2015.--The Administrator shall 
review, on a periodic basis, the progress being made in the development 
of alternative systems or products necessary to manufacture and operate 
appliances without class II substances. If the Administrator finds,

        of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
        Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration, and after notice and opportunity for public 
        comment, the Administrator determines that the global 
        production, consumption, and use of class II substances are 
        projected to contribute to an atmospheric chlorine loading in 
        excess of the base case projections by more than \5/10\ths part 
        per billion, the Administrator shall so inform Congress 
        immediately.
          (2) Determination.--A determination under paragraph (2) shall 
        be--
                  (A) based on the monitoring under subsection (d); and
                  (B) updated not less often than every 3 years.

        a showing by the petitioner that there are data adequate to 
        support the petition.
          (3) Further information.--If the Administrator determines 
        that information is not sufficient to make a determination 
        under this subsection, the Administrator shall use any 
        authority available to the Administrator, under any law 
        administered by the Administrator, to acquire the information.
          (4) Denial of petition.--If the Administrator denies the 
        petition, the Administrator shall publish an explanation of why 
        the petition was denied.
          (5) Grant of petition.--If the Administrator grants the 
        petition, the final regulations shall be promulgated within 1 
        year.
Sec. 237107. Exchange authority
  (a) Transfers.--The Administrator shall promulgate regulations under 
this subdivision providing for the issuance of allowances for the 
production of class I substances and class II substances in accordance 
with the requirements of this subdivision and governing the transfer of 
such allowances. The regulations shall ensure that the transactions 
under the authority of this section will result in greater total 
reductions in the production in each year of class I substances and 
class II substances than would occur in that year in the absence of 
such transactions.
  (b) Interpollutant Transfers.--
          (1) Production allowance.--The regulations under this section 
        shall permit a production allowance for a substance for any 
        year to be transferred for a production allowance for another

        basis.
          (2) Groups of class i substances.--Allowances for substances 
        in each group of class I substances (as listed pursuant to 
        section 237102 of this title) may be transferred only for 
        allowances for other class I substances in the same group.
          (3) Groups of class ii substances.--The Administrator shall, 
        as appropriate, establish groups of class II substances for 
        trading purposes and assign class II substances to such groups. 
        In the case of class II substances, allowances may be 
        transferred only for allowances for other class II substances 
        that are in the same group.
  (c) Trades With Other Persons.--The regulations under this section 
shall permit 2 or more persons to transfer production allowances 
(including interpollutant transfers that meet the requirements of 
subsections (a) and (b)) if the transferor of the allowances will be 
subject, under the regulations, to an enforceable and quantifiable 
reduction in annual production that--
          (1) exceeds the reduction otherwise applicable to the 
        transferor under this subdivision;
          (2) exceeds the production allowances transferred to the 
        transferee; and
          (3) would not have occurred in the absence of the 
        transaction.
  (d) Consumption.--The regulations under this section shall provide 
for the issuance of consumption allowances in accordance with the 
requirements of this subdivision and for the trading of such allowances 
in the same manner as is applicable under this section to the trading 
of production allowances under this section.

                existing source regulated under this subsection, the 
                term ``standard of performance'' means a standard that 
                the Administrator determines is applicable to that 
                source and that reflects the degree of emission 
                reduction achievable through the application of the 
                best system of continuous emission reduction that, 
                taking into consideration the cost of achieving that 
                degree of emission reduction and any nonair quality 
                health and environmental impact and energy 
                requirements, the Administrator determines has been 
                adequately demonstrated for that category of sources.

implementation by a State of a test-only I/M240 enhanced vehicle 
inspection and maintenance program as a means of compliance with

  (b) Limitation on Plan Disapproval.--The Administrator shall not 
disapprove or apply an automatic discount to a State implementation 
plan provision under section 215203 or 215303 of this title on the 
basis of a policy, regulation, or guidance providing for a discount of 
emission credits because the inspection and maintenance program in the 
plan provision is decentralized or is a test-and-repair program.
  (c) Emission Reduction Credits.--
          (1) State plan provision.--Not later than 120 days after 
        November 28, 1995, a State may submit an implementation plan 
        provision proposing an interim inspection and maintenance 
        program under section 215203 or 215303 of this title. The 
        Administrator shall approve the program based on the full 
        amount of credits proposed by the State for each element of the 
        program if the proposed credits reflected good faith estimates 
        by the State and the provision was otherwise in compliance with 
        division A. If, within the 120-day period, the State submits to 
        the Administrator proposed provisions of the implementation 
        plan, has all of the statutory authority necessary to implement 
        the provisions, and has proposed a regulation to adopt the 
        provisions, the Administrator may approve the provisions 
        without regard to whether or not the regulation had been issued 
        as a final regulation by the State.
          (2) Expiration of interim approval.--
                  (A) In general.--An interim approval under paragraph

                        beginning on the date of the interim approval; 
                        or
                          (ii) the date of final approval.
                  (B) No extension.--An interim approval may not be 
                extended.
          (3) Final approval.--The Administrator shall grant final 
        approval of a provision submitted under paragraph (1) based on 
        the credits proposed by the State during or after the period of 
        interim approval if data collected on the operation of the 
        State program demonstrates that the credits were appropriate 
        and the provision is otherwise in compliance with division A.
          (4) Basis of approval; no automatic discount.--Any 
        determination with respect to interim or full approval shall be 
        based on the elements of the program and shall not apply any 
        automatic discount because the program is decentralized or is a 
        test-and-repair program.

their respective authorities under division A, shall ensure that the 
national network (designated in subsection (a)), which consists of the

        keep such records and make such reports as are necessary to 
        ensure that the survey conducted under paragraph (1) is
