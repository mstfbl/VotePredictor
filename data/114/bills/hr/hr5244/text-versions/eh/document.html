                                 AN ACT


 
 To provide for the establishment of a national memorial and national 
   monument to commemorate those killed by the collapse of the Saint 
         Francis Dam on March 12, 1928, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saint Francis Dam Disaster National 
Memorial Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 12, 1928, the Saint Francis Dam located in the 
        northern portion of Los Angeles County, California, breached, 
        resulting in a devastating flood that caused the death of 
        approximately 425 individuals.
            (2) The residents of Santa Clarita Valley, San Francisquito 
        Canyon, Castaic Junction, Santa Clara River Valley, Piru, 
        Fillmore, Bardsdale, Saticoy, and Santa Paula were directly 
        impacted and suffered greatly from the worst flood in the 
        history of the State of California.
            (3) The disaster resulted in a tremendous loss of human 
        life, property, and the livelihood of local residents, and was 
        surpassed in the level of destruction in the 20th century only 
        by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906.
            (4) The collapse of the dam may represent America's worst 
        civil engineering failure in the 20th century.
            (5) The site of the disaster is subject to the theft of 
        historic artifacts, graffiti, and other vandalism.
            (6) It is right to pay homage to the citizens who were 
        killed, injured, or dislocated due to the flood, and to educate 
        the public about this important historical event.
            (7) It is appropriate that the site of the Saint Francis 
        Dam and surrounding areas be specially designated and protected 
        to commemorate this tragic event.
