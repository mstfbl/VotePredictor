    In this Act:
            (1) Affected area.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``affected area'' means 
                land along the approximately 116-mile stretch of the 
                Red River, from its confluence with the north fork of 
                the Red River on the West to the 98th meridian on the 
                east.
                    (B) Exclusions.--The term ``affected area'' does 
                not include the portion of the Red River within the 
                boundary depicted on the survey prepared by the Bureau 
                of Land Management entitled ``Township 5 South, Range 
                14 West, of the Indian Meridian, Oklahoma, Dependent 
                Resurvey and Survey'' and dated February 28, 2006.
            (2) Gradient boundary survey method.--The term ``gradient 
        boundary survey method'' means the measurement technique used 
        to locate the South Bank boundary line in accordance with the 
        methodology established in Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340 
        (1923) (recognizing that the boundary line along the Red River 
        is subject to change due to erosion and accretion).
            (3) Landowner.--The term ``landowner'' means any 
        individual, group, association, corporation, federally 
        recognized Indian tribe or member of such an Indian tribe, or 
        other private or governmental legal entity that owns an 
        interest in land in the affected area.
            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of the Interior, acting through the Director of the Bureau of 
        Land Management.
            (5) South bank.--The term ``South Bank'' means the water-
        washed and relatively permanent elevation or acclivity 
        (commonly known as a ``cut bank'') along the southerly or right 
        side of the Red River that--
                    (A) separates the bed of that river from the 
                adjacent upland, whether valley or hill; and
                    (B) usually serves, as specified in the fifth 
                paragraph of Oklahoma v. Texas, 261 U.S. 340 (1923)--
                            (i) to confine the waters within the bed; 
                        and
                            (ii) to preserve the course of the river.
            (6) South bank boundary line.--The term ``South Bank 
        boundary line'' means the boundary, with respect to title and 
        ownership, between the States of Oklahoma and Texas identified 
        through the gradient boundary survey method that does not 
        impact or alter the permanent political boundary line between 
        the States along the Red River, as outlined under article II, 
        section B of the Red River Boundary Compact enacted by the 
        States and consented to by Congress pursuant to Public Law 106-
        288 (114 Stat. 919).
