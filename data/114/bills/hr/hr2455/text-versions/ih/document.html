        product'; and
            ``(2) address the topics described in subsection (b).
    ``(b) Certain Issues.--The topics to be addressed by guidance under 
subsection (a) are--

        (as defined in section 507(e)) that identify subsets of 
        patients as likely responders to therapies in order to 
        streamline the conduct of clinical trials;
            ``(2) recommendations for the design of studies to 
        demonstrate the validity of a biomarker as a predictor of drug 
        or biological product response;
            ``(3) the manner and extent to which a benefit-risk 
        assessment may be affected when clinical trials are limited to 
        patient population subsets that are identified using 
        biomarkers;
            ``(4) the development of companion diagnostics in the 
        context of a drug development program; and
            ``(5) considerations for developing biomarkers that aid 
        prescribing decisions for a drug or biological product, and 
        when information regarding a biomarker may be included in the 
        labeling for a drug or biological product approved under 
        section 505 of this Act or section 351 of the Public Health 
        Service Act.

Service Act, that has been designated under section 526 as a drug for a 
rare disease for a serious condition, the Secretary may--
            ``(1) consistent with applicable standards for approval, 
        rely upon data or information previously developed by the 
        sponsor of the precision drug or biological product for a prior 
        approved drug or indication (or that of another sponsor, 
        provided the sponsor of the precision drug or biological 
        product has obtained a contractual right of reference to such 
        other sponsor's data and information) in order to expedite 
        clinical development for a precision drug or indication that is 
        using the same or similar approach as that of the prior 
        approved drug or indication; and
            ``(2) as appropriate under section 506, consider the 
        application for approval of such precision drug or biological 
        product to be eligible for expedited review, including under 
        section 506(c) (relating to accelerated approval).''.
