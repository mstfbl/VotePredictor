                        primary drug plan (as defined in clause (iv)) 
                        until such time as such primary drug plan pays 
                        a final settlement, judgment, or award to an 
                        individual enrolled under the prescription drug

                        eligible for or is provided coverage for 
                        covered part D drugs under this part.

                        paragraph, the term `primary drug plan' means,

                        plan (including a self-insured plan) or no-
                        fault insurance insofar as such a plan, law, 
                        policy, or insurance provides such benefits, 
                        insofar as, under the provisions of section 
                        1862(b)(2), such coverage would be treated as a 
                        primary plan if benefits for covered part D 
                        drugs were treated as benefits under parts A 
                        and B. For purposes of this clause, an entity 
                        that engages in a business, trade, or 
                        profession shall be deemed to have a self-
                        insured plan if it carries its own risk 
                        (whether by a failure to obtain insurance, or 
                        otherwise) in whole or in part.
                    ``(B) Recovery.--A prescription drug plan shall be 
                subrogated (to the extent of payment made under this 
                part by the plan for any covered part D drug before the 
                date the plan received notice pursuant to subparagraph 
                (D)) to any right of an individual or any other entity 
                to payment, with respect to such covered part D drug, 
                under a primary drug plan. A subrogation claim may not 
                be asserted pursuant to this subparagraph by a 
                prescription drug plan with respect to a payment for a 
                covered part D drug after the date that is 3 years 
                after the date such plan receives notice of a payment, 
                with respect to such covered part D drug, pursuant to 
                subparagraph (D). Any such subrogation claim shall be 
                the exclusive legal remedy of the PDP sponsor of the 
                plan and shall be reduced to take into account the cost 
                of procuring the judgment or settlement with respect to 
                such claim if an individual's liability, workers' 
                compensation, or no-fault claim is disputed. Any costs 
                or expense incurred by a prescription drug plan related 
                to recoveries pursuant to this subparagraph shall not 
                be considered an administrative cost or expense, as 
                those terms are used in this part.
                    ``(C) Waiver.--A prescription drug plan may waive 
                (in whole or in part) the provisions of this paragraph 
                in the case of an individual claim if the plan 
                determines that the waiver is in the best interests of 
                the program established under this part.

                prescription drug plan during an applicable time, the 
                Secretary shall provide such information to such 
                prescription drug plan in a format convenient and 
                accessible to such plans. The Secretary shall waive any 
                requirements under this part that a prescription drug 
                plan establish procedures for determining whether costs 
                for part D eligible individuals are being reimbursed 
                through insurance or otherwise or identify payers that 
                are primary to the program under subparagraph (A)(ii) 
                other than as required under this paragraph.

                responsibility for medical costs pursuant to paragraph

                of such covered part D drug to charge, in accordance 
                with the charges allowed under the prescription drug 
                plan, such primary drug plan for such covered part D 
                drug related to or arising out of the treatment

                payments subject to a claim under subparagraph (B) or 
                (F)) for the period in which the enrollee remains 
                enrolled in such plan through the date upon which such
