SEC. 2. PREMIUM PAY EXCEPTION IN 2016 FOR WORK AUTHORIZED UNDER SECTION 
              3056 OF TITLE 18.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
including section 5307 of title 5, United States Code, and subject to 
subsection (b), during calendar year 2016--
            (1) section 5547(a) of such title shall not apply to an 
        employee who performs work authorized by section 3056(a) of 
        title 18, United States Code; and
            (2) such an employee may be paid premium pay to the extent 
        that the payment of such pay does not cause the total of basic 
        pay and such premium pay for any pay period for such employee 
        to exceed the annual rate of basic pay payable to level II of 
        the Executive Schedule under section 5313 of title 5, United 
        States Code.
    (b) Treatment of Additional Pay.--To the extent that subsection (a) 
results in payment of additional premium pay of a type that is normally 
creditable as basic pay for retirement or any other purpose, such 
additional pay shall not be considered to be basic pay for any purpose 
and shall not be used in computing a lump-sum payment for accumulated 
and accrued annual leave under section 5551 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``employee'' means any 
special agent of the United States Secret Service that is a law

        Division; or
            (2) an officer, employee, agent, or law enforcement officer 
        of any other Federal agency.
    (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 118 of the Treasury and General 
Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-554) is amended by
