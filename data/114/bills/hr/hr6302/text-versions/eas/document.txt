SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Overtime Pay for Protective Services 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. PREMIUM PAY EXCEPTION IN 2016 FOR PROTECTIVE SERVICES.

    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``covered employee'' 
means any officer, employee, or agent employed by the United States 
Secret Service who performs protective services for an individual or 
event protected by the United States Secret Service during 2016.
    (b) Exception to the Limitation on Premium Pay for Protective 
Services.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, during 2016, section 5547(a) of title 5, United States 
        Code, shall not apply to any covered employee to the extent 
        that its application would prevent a covered employee from 
        receiving premium pay, as provided under the amendment made by 
        paragraph (2).
            (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--Section 118 of the 
        Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2001 (as 
        enacted into law by section 1(3) of Public Law 106-554; 114 
        Stat. 2763A-134) is amended, in the first sentence, by 
        inserting ``or, if the employee qualifies for an exception to 
        such limitation under section 2(b)(1) of the Overtime Pay for 
        Protective Services Act of 2016, to the extent that such 
        aggregate amount would exceed the rate of basic pay payable for 
        a position at level II of the Executive Schedule under section 
        5313 of title 5, United States Code'' after ``of that 
        limitation''.
    (c) Treatment of Additional Pay.--If subsection (b) results in the 
payment of additional premium pay to a covered employee of a type that 
is normally creditable as basic pay for retirement or any other 
purpose, that additional pay shall not--
            (1) be considered to be basic pay of the covered employee 
        for any purpose; or
            (2) be used in computing a lump-sum payment to the covered 
        employee for accumulated and accrued annual leave under section 
        5551 or section 5552 of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) Aggregate Limit.--With respect to the application of section 
5307 of title 5, United States Code, the payment of any additional 
premium pay to a covered employee as a result of subsection (b) shall 
not be counted as part of the aggregate compensation of the covered 
employee.
    (e) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made by this 
section shall take effect as if enacted on December 31, 2015.

            Amend the title so as to read: ``An Act to provide an 
        increase in premium pay for protective services during 2016, 
        and for other purposes.''.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.
