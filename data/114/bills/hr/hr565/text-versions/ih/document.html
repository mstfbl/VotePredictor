                                 A BILL


 
      To stimulate collaboration with respect to, and provide for 
   coordination and coherence of, the Nation's science, technology, 
   engineering, and mathematics education initiatives, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stepping Up to STEM Education Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Technology and the Internet have transformed nearly 
        every aspect of both the global economy and our daily lives. In 
        a technology-rich world, no amount of memorizing information 
        will make a student competitive in the global labor market. 
        America needs an education system that supports students from 
        all walks of life in becoming inquisitive, resourceful thinkers 
        who use technology to pursue knowledge, collaborate across 
        geographic and cultural boundaries, acquire new skills, and 
        solve complex problems.
            (2) Equality and equity of access is more than access to 
        the same hardware, software, and broadband connections. It 
        includes access to the best digital learning resources and 
        access to teachers who know how to orchestrate the use of these 
        resources in ways that inspire students and produce better 
        learning outcomes.
            (3) Technology by itself will not improve student outcomes. 
        What is needed are carefully designed innovations that include 
        not just technology but also good learning content, effective 
        instructional strategies, supports for teachers and school 
        systems figuring out how to use the new approach, and the 
        capacity to collect, analyze and reflect on data that will show 
        whether or not the innovation is having the intended effects.
            (4) Effective learning technology implementations 
        addressing the challenging aspects of language arts, 
        mathematics and science that all students are expected to 
        master. This will require partnerships among education 
        agencies, education researchers, and technology developers with 
        the common goal of harnessing technology to provide 
        opportunities for deeper learning to students who would not 
        otherwise experience them.

SEC. 3. ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY FOR EDUCATION.

    Title II of the Department of Education Organization Act (20 U.S.C. 
3411 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
