                                 A BILL


 
   To provide for the orderly disposal of certain Federal lands, to 
 benefit education and other purposes through the sales of such lands, 
to consolidate Federal lands to improve management, to provide for the 
acquisition of lands for recreational and other opportunities, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hunting, 
Education, and Recreational Development Act'' or the ``HEARD Act''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings and purpose.
Sec. 3. Definitions.
Sec. 4. Disposal.
Sec. 5. Lands to provide or increase recreational and other 
                            opportunities.
Sec. 6. Public availability of information on land potentially 
                            available for disposal.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The total Federal estate exceeds more than 635,000,000 
        acres.
            (2) The Federal Government owns parcels of varying size 
        interspersed with or adjacent to private, State, and tribal 
        lands throughout the United States, making many of these 
        parcels difficult to manage and more appropriate for disposal.
            (3) The Bureau of Land Management identifies certain lands 
        potentially available for disposal in revisions to resource 
        management plans.
            (4) Existing law does not require the Bureau of Land 
        Management to dispose of identified lands on a regular or 
        frequent basis. As a result, lands identified as potentially 
        available for disposal under valid resource management plans 
        are rarely disposed of by the Bureau of Land Management.
            (5) The Forest Service has several authorities to dispose 
        of Federal lands, but such authorities are rarely used.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to provide for the orderly disposal of certain Federal 
        lands;
            (2) to benefit education through the sales of such lands 
        and research focused on natural resource issues at educational 
        institutions;
            (3) to consolidate Federal lands to achieve better 
        management; and
            (4) to provide for the acquisition of certain lands to 
        provide or increase recreational and other purposes.

        interested persons, concerning the necessity of making the 
        acquisition, the potential impacts on State and local 
        government, and other appropriate aspects of the acquisition.

with other applicable requirements and standards. Fair market value

government over the fair market value of lands transferred by the unit 
of local government shall be paid to the Secretary concerned and shall 
be treated under subsection (d)(1) of section 4 as proceeds from the 
sale of land. For purposes of this subsection, the fair market value of
