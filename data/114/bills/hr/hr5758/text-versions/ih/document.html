_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To maximize land management efficiencies, promote land conservation, 
          generate education funding, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Conservation and Education 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) at statehood, Congress granted each of the western 
        States land to be held in trust by the States and used for the 
        support of public schools and other public institutions;
            (2) since the statehood land grants, Congress and the 
        executive branch have created multiple Federal conservation 
        areas on Federal land within the western States, including 
        national parks, national monuments, national conservation 
        areas, national grassland, wilderness areas, wilderness study 
        areas, and national wildlife refuges;
            (3) since statehood land grant land owned by the western 
        States are typically scattered across the public land, creation 
        of Federal conservation areas often includes State land grant 
        parcels with substantially different management mandates, 
        making land and resource management more difficult, expensive, 
        and controversial for both Federal land managers and the 
        western States; and
            (4) allowing the western States to relinquish State trust 
        land within Federal conservation areas and to select 
        replacement land from the public land within the respective 
        western States, would--
                    (A) enhance management of Federal conservation 
                areas by allowing unified management of those areas; 
                and
                    (B) increase revenue from the statehood land grants 
                for the support of public schools and other worthy 
                public purposes.

        Eligible Area in which the land is located without further 
        action by the Secretary with jurisdiction over the Federal 
        conservation area; and
            (2) if located within the National Forest System, be

        other Eligible Areas in the western State.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary may waive the limitation in 
        paragraph (1) on a determination that the relinquishment and 
        conveyance to the United States of substantially all State land 
        grant parcels located in priority areas in the western State is 
        impractical or infeasible.
            (3) Other state land grant parcels.--The Secretary may

                the collection of recreation fees under the Federal 
                Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (16 U.S.C. 6801 et

                    (D) is not in the public interest;

                property located within the public land proposed for 
                conveyance to the western State; and
                    (B) if the Secretary determines that traditional 
                cultural property is located within the public land 
                proposed for conveyance to the western State, consider 
                the extent to which protection would be available for 
                the traditional cultural property after conveyance of 
                the public land to the western State, including terms 
                or conditions that the Secretary, with the agreement of

        traditional cultural property located within the public land 
        proposed for conveyance to the western State pursuant to 
        paragraph (6)(B), determines that insufficient protection would 
        be available for the traditional cultural property after 
        conveyance of the public land to the western State;
            (8) shall, for applications by a western State for the

                adjacent Federal land; and

    (a) Equal Value.--
            (1) In general.--The overall value of the State land grant

                    (B) if the value is not equal--
                            (i) equalized by the payment of funds to 
                        the western State or to the Secretary as the 
                        circumstances require; or
                            (ii) reflected on the balance of a ledger

            (2) Appraisal required.--Except as provided in subsection 
        (b), the Secretary shall determine the value of a State land

            (3) Equalization.--For each transaction, an equalization 
        payment described in paragraph (1)(B)(i) or a ledger entry 
        described in paragraph (1)(B)(ii) may not exceed 25 percent of 
        the total value of the land or interest transferred out of 
        Federal ownership.
    (b) Low Value Parcels.--
            (1) Valuation.--The Secretary may, with the consent of a 
        western State, use a summary appraisal or statement of value 
        made by a qualified appraiser carried out in accordance with 
        the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisal Practice 
        instead of an appraisal that complies with the Uniform 
        Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions if the 
        western State and the Secretary agree that the market value of 
        a State land grant parcel or a parcel of public land is--
                    (A) less than $500,000; and
                    (B) less than $500 per acre.
            (2) Division.--A State land grant parcel or a parcel of 
        public land may not be artificially divided in order to qualify

    (c) Ledger Accounts.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary and any western State may

            (2) Imbalances.--A ledger account described in paragraph

        subsequent transaction.
            (3) Account balancing.--Each ledger account shall be--
                    (A) balanced not later than 3 years after the date 
                on which the ledger account is established; and
                    (B) closed not later than 5 years after the date of

            (1) In general.--The Secretary or the western State may 
        assume costs or other responsibilities or requirements for 
        conveying land under this Act that ordinarily are borne by the 
        other party.
            (2) Adjustment.--If the Secretary assumes costs or other 
        responsibilities under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make 
        adjustments to the value of the public land conveyed to the 
        western State to compensate the Secretary for assuming the 
        costs or other responsibilities.
    (e) Adjustment.--If value is attributed to any parcel of public 
land that has been selected by a western State because of the presence 
of minerals under a lease entered into under the Mineral Leasing Act 
(30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) that is in a producing or producible status, 
and the lease is to be conveyed under this Act, the value of the parcel 
shall be reduced by the amount that represents the likely Federal 
revenue sharing obligation under that Act, but the adjustment shall not 
be considered as reflecting a property right of the western State.

            (1) In general.--The Secretary and the western States shall

            (3) Cancellation.--
                    (A) In general.--Nothing in this Act prevents the

                located within the National Forest System) or the 
                western State from canceling or modifying a grazing 
                permit, lease, or contract if the land subject to the 
                permit, lease, or contract is sold, conveyed, 
                transferred, or leased for nongrazing purposes.
                    (B) Limitation.--Except to the extent reasonably

                of mineral development, the Secretary (or the Secretary 
                of Agriculture for land located within the National 
                Forest System) or the western State shall not cancel or 
                modify a grazing permit, lease, or contract for land 
                conveyed pursuant to this Act because the land subject

        any renewal or extension of the lease or permit.
            (5) Range improvements.--Nothing in this Act shall be 
        construed to prohibit a holder of a grazing lease, permit, or
