    Congress finds that--
            (1) in 1961, the James K. Polk Home was designated as a 
        National Historic Landmark; and
            (2) in April 2015, the National Park Service completed a 
        reconnaissance survey of the James K. Polk Home, in which the 
        National Park Service--

                            (i) the James K. Polk Home is conclusively 
                        nationally significant; and
                            (ii) a special resource study is needed to 
                        fully analyze the suitability, feasibility, and 
                        need for management of the James K. Polk Home 
                        by the National Park Service; and
                    (B) recommended that Congress consider authorizing 
                a special resource study for the James K. Polk Home and 
                associated properties.
