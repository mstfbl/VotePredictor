            ``(2) Noncompliance period.--For purposes of this section, 
        the term `noncompliance period' means, with respect to any 
        failure, the period beginning on the date the failure first 
        occurs and ending on the date the notice to which the failure 
        relates is provided or the failure is otherwise corrected.
    ``(c) Limitations on Amount of Tax.--
            ``(1) Tax not to apply where failure not discovered and 
        reasonable diligence exercised.--No tax shall be imposed by 
        subsection (a) on any failure during any period for which it is 
        established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that any 
        employer subject to liability for the tax under subsection (d) 
        did not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable 
        diligence to meet the requirements of subsection (e).
            ``(2) Tax not to apply to failures corrected within 30 
        days.--No tax shall be imposed by subsection (a) on any failure

                meet the requirements of subsection (e), and
                    ``(B) such employer provides the notice described 
                in subsection (e) during the 30-day period beginning on 
                the first date such employer knew, or exercising 
                reasonable diligence would have known, that such 
                failure existed.
            ``(3) Overall limitation for unintentional failures.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If the employer subject to 
                liability for tax under subsection (d) exercised 
                reasonable diligence to meet the requirements of 
                subsection (e), the tax imposed by subsection (a) for 
                failures during the taxable year of the employer shall 
                not exceed $500,000.
                    ``(B) Taxable years in the case of certain 
                controlled groups.--For purposes of this paragraph, if 
                all persons who are treated as a single employer for 
                purposes of this section do not have the same taxable 
                year, the taxable years taken into account shall be 
                determined under principles similar to the principles 
                of section 1561.
            ``(4) Waiver by secretary.--In the case of a failure which 
        is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the 
        Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed by 
        subsection (a) to the extent that the payment of such tax would 
        be excessive or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure 
        involved.
    ``(d) Liability for Tax.--The employer shall be liable for the tax 
imposed by subsection (a).
    ``(e) Employer Requirements Relating to MyRA Accounts.--
            ``(1) In general.--An employer who pays wages to any

        the MyRA program under section 3106(d) of title 31, United 
        States Code.
            ``(2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any 
        employer with respect to an employee if the employer offers an 
        employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan to the employee.
