                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 14, 2016

                                 AN ACT


 
     To combat trafficking in human organs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Strategy To Oppose Predatory Organ 
Trafficking Act'' or the ``STOP Organ Trafficking Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 
        approximately 10 percent of all transplanted kidneys worldwide 
        are illegally obtained, often bought from vulnerable 
        impoverished persons or forcibly harvested from prisoners.
            (2) In 2004, the World Health Assembly passed a resolution 
        urging its member-states to take measures to protect the 
        poorest as well as vulnerable groups from exploitation by organ 
        traffickers.
            (3) On February 13, 2008, the United Nations Global 
        Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UNGIFT) hosted the 
        ``Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking'', and subsequently 
        reported that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws 
        has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to grow.
            (4) On March 21, 2011, the Council of the European Union 
        adopted rules supplementing the definition of criminal offenses 
        and the level of sanctions in order to strengthen the 
        prevention of organ trafficking and the protection of those 
        victims.
            (5) In 2005, the United States ratified the Protocol to 
        Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially 
        Women and Children, a supplement to the United Nations 
        Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which 
        includes the removal of organs as a form of exploitation under 
        the definition of ``trafficking in persons''.
            (6) According to a 2013 United Nations report from the 
        Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women 
        and children, the economic and social divisions within and 
        among countries is notably reflected in the illicit organ 
        trafficking market, in which the victims are commonly poor, 
        unemployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for the 
        purpose of extracting their organs for profit is in 
        contradiction of the ideals and standards for ethical behavior 
        upon which the United States has based its laws;
            (2) the illegal harvesting of organs from children is a 
        violation of the human rights of the child and is a breach of 
        internationally accepted medical ethical standards described in 
        WHO Assembly Resolution 57.18 (May 22, 2004);
            (3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of organs 
        violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in Article 
        3 which states that ``Everyone has the right to life, liberty 
        and security of person.'', and in Article 4 which states that 
        ``No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.''; and
            (4) establishing efficient voluntary organ donation systems 
        with strong enforcement mechanisms is the most effective way to 
        combat trafficking of persons for the removal of their organs.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to--
            (1) combat the international trafficking of persons for the 
        removal of their organs;
            (2) promote the establishment of voluntary organ donation 
        systems with effective enforcement mechanisms in bilateral 
        diplomatic meetings, as well as in international health forums; 
        and
            (3) promote the dignity and security of human life in 
        accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

SEC. 5. REVOCATION OR DENIAL OF PASSPORTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ORGAN 
              TRAFFICKERS.

    The Act entitled ``An Act to regulate the issue and validity of 
passports, and for other purposes'', approved July 3, 1926 (22 U.S.C. 
211a et seq.), which is commonly known as the ``Passport Act of 1926'', 
is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 4. AUTHORITY TO DENY OR REVOKE PASSPORT.

    ``(a) Issuance.--The Secretary of State may refuse to issue a 
passport to any individual who has been convicted of an offense under 
section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act (42 U.S.C. 274e) if 
such individual used a passport or otherwise crossed an international 
border in the commission of such an offence.
    ``(b) Revocation.--The Secretary of State may revoke a passport 
previously issued to any individual described in paragraph (1).''.
