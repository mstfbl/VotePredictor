        SMEs, attend relevant business conferences and trade shows to 
        advertise the availability of the resources of the USEAC to 
        SMEs, and perform other tasks designed to help non-exporting 
        SMEs become exporters.
            (2) Additional personnel.--The Under Secretary shall, in 
        the case of those USEACs that the report submitted to Congress

        at those USEACs (by an average of not more than 5 for each 
        USEAC) to the extent necessary to enhance the ability of the 
        USEACs, through outreach and provision of services to SMEs, to 
        increase exports by SMEs, in particular non-exporting SMEs.
            (3) Trade specialists.--The Director General shall ensure 
        that specialists in an increased number of areas are on the 
        staff of USEACs in order to serve an increased number of SMEs.
