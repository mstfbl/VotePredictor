              PROCESS.

    (a) Review.--The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention shall conduct a review of the transparency and consistency 
of the process used by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices 
in formulating and issuing recommendations pertaining to vaccines.
    (b) Considerations.--The review under subsection (a) shall include 
assessment of--
            (1) the criteria used to evaluate new and existing 
        vaccines;
            (2) the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
        Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to the review and 
        analysis of scientific and economic data, including the 
        scientific basis for such approach; and
            (3) the extent to which the processes used by the working 
        groups of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are 
        transparent and consistent.
    (c) Stakeholders.--In carrying out the review under subsection (a), 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall 
solicit input from vaccine stakeholders.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of

Prevention shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress 
and make publicly available a report on the results of the review under 
subsection (a), including recommendations on improving the transparency 
and consistency of the process described in such subsection.

final guidance to facilitate the use of accelerated and expedited 
pathways for the development and licensure of vaccines to prevent--
            (1) emerging, re-emerging, or rare infectious diseases with 
        respect to which the low prevalence or nature of the disease 
        may render the existence or collection of clinical outcome data 
        unlikely or impractical; and
            (2) infectious diseases with respect to which currently 
        available vaccines are not addressing the full scope of public 
        health needs.
    (b) Considerations.--In developing the guidance required by this 
section, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider 
issues relating to clinical development strategies for diseases
