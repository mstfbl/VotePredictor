                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 38, United States Code, and the Internal Revenue Code of 
 1986 to establish, in the event of any war, a war tax to be collected 
     and deposited in a trust fund for the payment of benefits and 
                 compensation to veterans of that war.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care Trust Fund 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) war is inherently unpredictable, and the true cost of 
        health care related to conflicts is often not fully understood 
        until several decades later;
            (2) an independent estimate from Harvard University found 
        that over the next 40-50 years, the costs related to health 
        care and disability compensation for the wars in Iraq and 
        Afghanistan will exceed $970 billion;
            (3) this is evidenced by the growing treatment costs for 
        conditions related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam 
        Veterans, Gulf War Syndrome in Gulf War Veterans, and 
        conditions related to burn pit exposure in Iraq and Afghanistan 
        Veterans; and
            (4) taking steps to address these costs now ensures that 
        Congress fully accounts for these costs when considering the 
        use of military force and that our Nation is better postured to 
        address the long-term and unforeseen health care needs of its 
        veterans.
