  To amend the Federal Power Act to provide that any inaction by the

of action by the Commission that allows a change to take effect under 
this section, including the Commission allowing the sixty days' notice 
herein provided to expire without Commission action, shall be treated

of section 313.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 14, 2016.

            Attest:
