carry out a pilot program under which the Secretary shall enter into a 
contract with one or more appropriate non-government entities for the 
purpose of assessing the effectiveness of addressing post-deployment 
mental health and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms through a 
therapeutic medium of training service dogs for veterans with 
disabilities.
    (b) Duration of Pilot Program.--The pilot program required by 
subsection (a) shall be carried out during the five-year period 
beginning on the date of the commencement of the pilot program.

purposes of the pilot program, the Secretary shall seek to enter into 
contracts with appropriate non-government entities located in close 
proximity to at least three but not more than five medical centers of 
the Department.
    (d) Appropriate Non-Government Entities.--For purposes of the pilot 
program, an appropriate non-government entity is an entity that is 
certified in the training and handling of service dogs and that has a 
training area that would be appropriate for use in educating veterans 
with mental health conditions in the art and science of service dog 
training and handling. Such training area shall--
            (1) include a dedicated space that is suitable for grooming

        training the dogs with wheelchairs and conducting other 
        exercises;
            (7) include outdoor exercise and toileting space for dogs; 
        and
            (8) provide transportation for weekly field trips to train 
        dogs in other environments.
    (e) Design of Pilot Program.--Each contract entered into under 
subsection (a) shall provide that the non-government entity shall--
            (1) ensure that veterans participating in the program 
        receive training from certified service dog training 
        instructors;
            (2) ensure that in selecting assistance dogs for use in the 
        program, dogs residing in animal shelters or foster homes are 
        looked at as an option, if appropriate, and ensure that all 
        dogs used in the program have adequate temperament and health 
        clearances;
            (3) ensure that each service dog in training participating 
        in the pilot program is taught all essential commands 
        pertaining to service dog skills;
            (4) ensure that each service dog in training lives at the 
        pilot program site or a volunteer foster home in the vicinity 
        of such site while receiving training;
            (5) ensure that the pilot program involves both lecture of 
        service dog training methodologies and practical hands-on 
        training and grooming of service dogs; and
            (6) ensure that the pilot program is designed to--
                    (A) maximize the therapeutic benefits to veterans 
                participating in the program; and
                    (B) provide well-trained service dogs to veterans 
                with disabilities; and
            (7) in hiring service dog training instructors to carry out 
        training under the pilot program, give a preference to veterans 
        who have successfully graduated from post-traumatic stress 
        disorder or other residential treatment programs and who have 
        received adequate certification in service dog training.
    (f) Administration.--In order to carry out the pilot program under 
section (a), the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall--
            (1) administer the program through the Recreation Therapy 
        Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs under the 
        direction of a certified recreational therapist with sufficient 
        administrative experience to oversee the pilot program; and

veterans in--

the commencement of the pilot program under subsection (a), and each 
year thereafter for the duration of the pilot program, the Secretary
