    To prevent application of sequestration to payment for certain 
 physician-administered drugs under part B of the Medicare program in 
          fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cancer Patient Protection Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. PREVENTING APPLICATION OF SEQUESTRATION TO PAYMENT FOR 
              PHYSICIAN-ADMINISTERED DRUGS UNDER PART B OF THE MEDICARE 
              PROGRAM IN FISCAL YEARS 2016 AND 2017.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any 
Presidential order issued after the date of the enactment of this Act 
under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a) for fiscal year 2016 or for fiscal year 
2017 shall provide that no reduction is made with respect to payments 
for drugs and biologicals under section 1847A of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4) to the extent that such payments are made based 
on the average sales price for such drugs and biologicals.
    (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section (other than subsection 
(d)) shall be construed as affecting any other payments under title 
XVIII of the Social Security Act or any other Act (other than under 
this section) or as requiring or authorizing the reduction of other 
payments, under such title or otherwise, by virtue of the application 
of this section.
    (c) GAO Study of Shift in Location of Cancer Care.--The Comptroller 
General of the United States shall conduct a study that examines the 
shift of cancer care from physician-run community cancer clinics to 
hospitals and the consequences of this shift to costs to the Federal 
Government and to Medicare beneficiaries for cancer care under the 
Medicare program. Not later than February 1, 2017, the Comptroller 
General shall submit a report to Congress on the results of such study.
    (d) Imposition of Budget Neutrality.--If a Presidential order 
described in subsection (a) is issued with respect to fiscal year 2016 
and is also issued with respect to fiscal year 2024 (or with respect to 
fiscal year 2017 and also issued with respect to fiscal year 2025), the 
amount of the aggregate payment reduction required under such an order 
with respect to fiscal year 2024 (or fiscal year 2025, respectfully) 
shall be increased by an amount equivalent to the amount of the payment 
increase resulting from the application of subsection (a) in fiscal 
year 2016 (or fiscal year 2017, respectively).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
