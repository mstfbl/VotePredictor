              THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    Section 7423(a) of title 38, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``(a) The hours'' and inserting ``(a)(1) 
        Except as provided in paragraph (2), the hours''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(2)(A) Upon the advance written request of a covered physician, 
the Secretary may modify the hours of employment for a physician 
appointed in the Administration under any provision of this chapter on 
a full-time basis to be more or less than 80 hours in a biweekly pay

    ``(C) The Secretary may prescribe regulations to implement this 
paragraph, including regulations making adjustments to address the 
annual hours requirement for physicians who are covered by this 
paragraph for only a portion of a calendar year.''.
