        DMEPOS competitive acquisition program under section 1847 of 
        the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3).
            (2) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date 
        contracts are first awarded subject to such bid surety bond 
        requirement, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a 
        report on the study conducted under paragraph (1). Such report 
        shall include recommendations for changes in such requirement 
        in order to ensure robust participation by legitimate small 
        suppliers in the Medicare DMEPOS competition acquisition 
        program.
