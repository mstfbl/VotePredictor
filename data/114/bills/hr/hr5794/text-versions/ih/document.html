                                 A BILL


 
To make certain improvements in the laws administered by the Secretary 
 of Homeland Security relating to public transportation security, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America's Facilities, 
Equipment and Rail: Taking Responsibility for American National 
Security in Transit Act'' or the ``SAFER TRANSIT Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nationwide, Americans rely on 6,800 public 
        transportation systems for their daily commute. Every weekday, 
        public transportation riders take 35,000,000 trips. Public 
        transportation significantly improves quality of life, saving 
        Americans who live in areas served by public transportation 
        systems nearly 865,000,000 hours in travel time annually.
            (2) Increasingly, public transportation is becoming a 
        target of terrorist activity.
            (3) In 2004, terrorists simultaneously detonated explosives 
        concealed inside backpacks on Madrid's commuter train system, 
        killing 191 and injuring nearly 2,000.
            (4) In 2005, four suicide bombers attacked London's public 
        transportation system, killing 52.
            (5) In 2011, authorities discovered an improvised 
        explosives device near Amtrak and commuter train tracks. The 
        same year, German police found multiple firebombs alongside 
        high speed rail tracks and in tunnels leading into train 
        stations.
            (6) On March 22, 2016, a coordinated terrorist attack 
        targeted both the Brussels Airport and a metro station in the 
        city killing 32 and injuring nearly 300 travelers.
            (7) According to the Global Terrorism Database, there were 
        57 terror attacks on transportation from 2006 to 2014.
            (8) To ensure the continued effectiveness of public 
        transportation, the Federal Government must balance transit 
        system security and accessibility.
            (9) The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission 
        Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53), conferred to the Department of 
        Homeland Security the responsibility for assuring public 
        transportation security.
            (10) A May 2016 report by the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Homeland Security found that the Transportation 
        Security Administration has limited regulatory oversight of 
        Amtrak's passenger security.
            (11) A May 2016 report by the Government Accountability 
        Office recommended that the Federal Air Marshal Service 
        undertake a number of measures to ensure resources are 
        allocated according to risk assessments.
            (12) Congress must provide the agencies and municipalities 
        with the necessary resources to combat terrorism, and continue 
        to conduct oversight of their effective use.

    The Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such steps as may be

in this section referred to as the ``FAMS'') uses its resources to 
cover the highest-risk flights. In carrying out this section, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) consider risk when determining how to divide the 
        international flight coverage resources of the FAMS among

        the FAMS for initially setting its annual target numbers of 
        average daily international and domestic flights;
            (2) conduct and document a risk assessment to further 
        support the domestic resource allocation decisions of the FAMS, 
        including the identification of high-priority geographic areas;
            (3) in conducting such risk assessment, evaluate the threat 
        environment with regard to each of the different modes of 
        transportation supported by the FAMS to inform resource 
        allocation decisions, including the identification of high-
        priority modes of transportation;
            (4) document the rationale for the selection of 
        international destinations by FAMS for air marshal deployment 
        and the proportion of flights to cover at each destination;
            (5) adopt a consistent name and definition for the 
        performance measure referred to as the TSA coverage score that 
        accurately reflects its calculation method and composite 
        nature; and
            (6) report the performance results for each of the 
        subcategories that comprise the TSA coverage score to FAMS and 
        TSA leadership.
