        accessible manner, including by making the notice of intent to 
        sue and the complaint available online not later than 15 days 
        after receiving service of the notice of intent to sue or

        agreement.--A party may not make a motion for entry of a 
        covered consent decree or to dismiss a civil action pursuant to

        intervene in a covered civil action or a civil action in which 
        a covered consent decree or settlement agreement has been 
        proposed that is filed by a person who alleges that the agency 
        action in dispute would affect the person, the court shall 
        presume, subject to rebuttal, that the interests of the person 
        would not be represented adequately by the existing parties to 
        the action.
            (2) State, local, and tribal governments.--In considering a 
        motion to intervene in a covered civil action or a civil action 
        in which a covered consent decree or settlement agreement has

        government, the court shall take due account of whether the 
        movant--
                    (A) administers jointly with an agency that is a 
                defendant in the action the statutory provisions that 
                give rise to the regulatory action to which the action 
                relates; or
                    (B) administers an authority under State, local, or 
                tribal law that would be preempted by the regulatory 
                action to which the action relates.
    (c) Settlement Negotiations.--Efforts to settle a covered civil 
action or otherwise reach an agreement on a covered consent decree or 
settlement agreement shall--

        master, as determined appropriate by the presiding judge; and
            (2) include any party that intervenes in the action.
    (d) Publication of and Comment on Covered Consent Decrees or 
Settlement Agreements.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days before the date on 
        which a covered consent decree or settlement agreement is filed

        Register and online--
                    (A) the proposed covered consent decree or 
                settlement agreement; and
                    (B) a statement providing--

                        consent decree or settlement agreement; and
                            (ii) a description of the terms of the 
                        covered consent decree or settlement agreement, 
                        including whether it provides for the award of 
                        attorneys' fees or costs and, if so, the basis 
                        for including the award.

                    (A) In general.--An agency seeking to enter a 
                covered consent decree or settlement agreement shall

                agreement.

        date certain, the agency shall, when moving for entry of the

                agreement does not address;
                    (B) how the covered consent decree or settlement 
                agreement, if approved, would affect the discharge of 
                the duties described in subparagraph (A); and
                    (C) why the effects of the covered consent decree 
                or settlement agreement on the manner in which the

    (e) Submission by the Government.--

        head of the agency shall personally sign any certification 
        submitted under this paragraph.
            (2) Terms.--A term described in this paragraph is--
                    (A) in the case of a covered consent decree, a term 
                that--
                            (i) converts into a nondiscretionary duty a 
                        discretionary authority of an agency to 
                        propose, promulgate, revise, or amend 
                        regulations;
                            (ii) commits an agency to expend funds that 
                        have not been appropriated and that have not 
                        been budgeted for the regulatory action in 
                        question;
                            (iii) commits an agency to seek a 
                        particular appropriation or budget 
                        authorization;
                            (iv) divests an agency of discretion 
                        committed to the agency by statute or the 
                        Constitution of the United States, without 
                        regard to whether the discretion was granted to 
                        respond to changing circumstances, to make 
                        policy or managerial choices, or to protect the 
                        rights of third parties; or
                            (v) otherwise affords relief that the court 
                        could not enter under its own authority upon a 
                        final judgment in the civil action; or
                    (B) in the case of a covered settlement agreement, 
                a term--
                            (i) that provides a remedy for a failure by 
                        the agency to comply with the terms of the 
                        covered settlement agreement other than the 
                        revival of the civil action resolved by the 
                        covered settlement agreement; and
                            (ii) that--
                                    (I) interferes with the authority 
                                of an agency to revise, amend, or issue 
                                rules under the procedures set forth in 
                                chapter 5 of title 5, United States 
                                Code, or any other statute or Executive 
                                order prescribing rulemaking procedures 
                                for a rulemaking that is the subject of 
                                the covered settlement agreement;
                                    (II) commits the agency to expend 
                                funds that have not been appropriated 
                                and that have not been budgeted for the 
                                regulatory action in question; or
                                    (III) for such a covered settlement 
                                agreement that commits the agency to 
                                exercise in a particular way discretion 
                                which was committed to the agency by 
                                statute or the Constitution of the 
                                United States to respond to changing 
                                circumstances, to make policy or 
                                managerial choices, or to protect the 
                                rights of third parties.
    (f) Review by Court.--
            (1) Amicus.--A court considering a proposed covered consent 
        decree or settlement agreement shall presume, subject to 
        rebuttal, that it is proper to allow amicus participation 
        relating to the covered consent decree or settlement agreement 
        by any person who filed public comments or participated in a

                approve the covered consent decree unless the proposed 
                covered consent decree allows sufficient time and 
                incorporates adequate procedures for the agency to 
                comply with chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, 
                and other applicable statutes that govern rulemaking 
                and, unless contrary to the public interest, the 
                provisions of any Executive order that governs

                    (B) Proposed covered settlement agreements.--For a 
                proposed covered settlement agreement, a court shall 
                ensure that the covered settlement agreement allows 
                sufficient time and incorporates adequate procedures 
                for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, 
                United States Code, and other applicable statutes that 
                govern rulemaking and, unless contrary to the public 
                interest, the provisions of any Executive order that 
                governs rulemaking.
