                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to 
 establish a program to make loans to certain businesses, homeowners, 
               and renters affected by Superstorm Sandy.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster 
Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused substantial physical 
        and economic damage to the United States, and New York in 
        particular.
            (2) For businesses and homeowners, the primary means of 
        obtaining long-term Federal financial assistance in the wake of 
        disasters such as Superstorm Sandy is through the Small 
        Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program.
            (3) With regard to the Small Business Administration's 
        operation of the Disaster Loan Program after Superstorm Sandy, 
        the Government Accountability Office found that the 
        Administration did not meet its timeliness goals for processing 
        business loan applications.
            (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, the 
        Small Business Administration stated that it was challenged by 
        an unexpectedly high volume of loan applications that it 
        received early in its response to Superstorm Sandy.
            (5) As a result, many businesses and homeowners affected by 
        Superstorm Sandy were unable to apply for financing from the 
        Small Business Administration.

SEC. 3. REVISED DISASTER DEADLINE.

    Section 7(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(d)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) Disaster loans for superstorm sandy.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, and subject to the same requirements 
                and procedures that are used to make loans pursuant to 
                subsection (b), a small business concern, homeowner, or 
                renter that was located within an area and during the

                declared by the President under section 401 of the 
                Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
                Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) by reason of Superstorm 
                Sandy may apply to the Administrator--
                            ``(i) for a loan to repair, rehabilitate, 
                        or replace property damaged or destroyed by 
                        reason of Superstorm Sandy; or
                            ``(ii) if such a small business concern has 
                        suffered substantial economic injury by reason 
                        of Superstorm Sandy, for a loan to assist such 
                        a small business concern.
                    ``(B) Timing.--The Administrator shall select loan 
                recipients and make available loans for a period of not 
                less than 1 year after the date on which the

                    ``(iii) relocating utilities and modifying

        collateral if--
                    ``(A) other collateral exists, including assets 
                related to the operation of a business; and
                    ``(B) such an option does not delay the 
                Administrator's processing of disaster applications for 
                a disaster.''.
