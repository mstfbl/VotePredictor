  To recognize that Christians and Yazidis in Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, 
Iran, Egypt, and Libya are targets of genocide, and to provide for the

    This Act may be cited as the ``Save Christians from Genocide Act''.

SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    Congress--
            (1) recognizes that Christians and Yazidis in Iraq, Syria, 
        Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, and Libya are targets of genocide and 
        encourages other nations to likewise recognize the ongoing 
        genocide and the threat of genocide to these people; and
            (2) further recognizes that such targets of genocide who 
        are seeking admission to the United States as immigrants or

                    (A) membership in the Christian or Yazidi community 
                shall qualify an alien described in paragraph (3) as a 
                member of a persecuted group; and
                    (B) the requirement that an alien be outside any 
                country of such person's nationality or, in the case of 
                a person having no nationality, is outside any country

        applications for immigrant status.
            (2) Aliens described.--An alien is described in this 
        paragraph if the alien--
