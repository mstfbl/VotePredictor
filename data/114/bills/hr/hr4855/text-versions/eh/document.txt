                last business day of the issuer's most recently

                affiliates by the price at which such securities were

                securities) in the principal market for such securities 
                or, in the event the result of such public float 
                calculation is zero, had annual revenues of less than 
                $50,000,000 as of the issuer's most recently completed 
                fiscal year.''.
