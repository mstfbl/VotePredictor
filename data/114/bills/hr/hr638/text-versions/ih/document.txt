                    (A) application of the recipient with respect to 
                such assistance was made in good faith and provided

                    (B) receipt of such assistance could reasonably 
                have been expected by the recipient; or
            (2) the receipt of such assistance occurred on a date that 
        is more than 3 years before the date on which the Federal 
        Emergency Management Agency first provides to the recipient 
        written notification of an intent to recoup.
    (b) Disclosure of Fault.--In carrying out a recoupment of covered 
assistance that is not prohibited under subsection (a), the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency shall provide to the relevant recipient
