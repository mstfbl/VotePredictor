    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Defend Israel by Defunding 
Palestinian Foreign Aid Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On December 31, 2014, Mahmoud Abbas, the President of 
        the Palestinian Authority, signed several international 
        conventions in an attempt to join the International Criminal 
        Court.
            (2) The Palestinian Authority has indicated that it will 
        seek to use the International Criminal Court as a means to 
        pursue charges against Israel.
            (3) The Palestinian Authority remains engaged in a unity 
        government with Hamas, a terrorist organization responsible for 
        countless deaths and whose charter declares that ``there is no 
        solution to the Palestinian question except by Jihad''.
            (4) The United States provides more than $400,000,000 in 
        assistance to the Palestinian Authority each year.
            (5) Section 7041(i)(2) of the Department of State, Foreign 
        Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015 
        (division J of Public Law 133-235) includes limitations on 
        assistance to the Palestinian Authority if it seeks to join the 
        International Criminal Court.
            (6) The United States Government must make immediately 
        clear to the Palestinian Authority that its attempts to join 
        the International Criminal Court will carry serious 
        consequences.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no amounts may be 
obligated or expended to provide any assistance, loan guarantee, or 
debt relief to the Palestinian Authority, or any affiliated governing 
entity, until the Palestinian Authority withdraws its request to join 
the International Criminal Court.
