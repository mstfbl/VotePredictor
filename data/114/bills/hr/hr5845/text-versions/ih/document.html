            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services, in consultation with patient advocacy groups and 
        other relevant stakeholders as determined by such Secretary, 
        shall establish a mechanism by which--
                    (A) any amount paid by an eligible patient in 
                connection with the tax under section 4192 of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by this 
                section) shall be rebated to such patient in as timely 
                a manner as possible, or
                    (B) amounts paid by an eligible patient for taxable 
                active opioids (as defined in section 4192(b) of such 
                Code) are discounted at time of payment or purchase to 
                ensure that such patient does not pay any amount 
                attributable to such tax,
        with as little burden on the patient as possible. The Secretary 
        shall choose whichever of the options described in subparagraph 
        (A) or (B) is, in the Secretary's determination, most effective 
        and efficient in ensuring eligible patients face no economic 
        burden from such tax.
            (2) Eligible patient.--For purposes of this section, the 
        term ``eligible patient'' means--
                    (A) a patient for whom any taxable active opioid 
                (as so defined) is prescribed to treat pain relating to 
                cancer or cancer treatment;
                    (B) a patient participating in hospice care; and
                    (C) in the case of the death or incapacity of a 
                patient described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or any 
                similar situation as determined by the Secretary of 
                Health and Human Services, the appropriate family 
                member, medical proxy, or similar representative or the 
                estate of such patient.
