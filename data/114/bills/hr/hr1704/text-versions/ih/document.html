business entity engaged in or affecting interstate commerce, that uses, 
accesses, transmits, stores, disposes of, or collects sensitive 
personally identifiable information about more than 10,000 individuals 
during any 12-month period shall, following the discovery of a security 
breach of such information, notify, in accordance with sections 103 and 
104, any individual whose sensitive personally identifiable information 
has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed or acquired.
    (b) Obligations of and to Owner or Licensee.--

        engaged in or affecting interstate commerce, that uses, 
        accesses, transmits, stores, disposes of, or collects sensitive 
        personally identifiable information that the business entity 
        does not own or license shall notify the owner or licensee of 
        the information following the discovery of a security breach 
        involving such information, unless there is no reasonable risk 
        of harm or fraud to such owner or licensee.
            (2) Notification by owner, licensee, or other designated 
        third party.--Nothing in this title shall prevent or abrogate 
        an agreement between a business entity required to provide 
        notification under this section and a designated third party, 
        including an owner or licensee of the sensitive personally 
        identifiable information subject to the security breach, to 
        provide the notifications required under subsection (a).
            (3) Business entity relieved from giving notification.--A 
        business entity required to provide notification under 
        subsection (a) shall not be required to provide such 
        notification if an owner or licensee of the sensitive 
        personally identifiable information subject to the security 
        breach, or other designated third party, provides such 
        notification.
    (c) Timeliness of Notification.--
            (1) In general.--All notifications required under this 
        section shall be made without unreasonable delay following the 
        discovery by the business entity of a security breach. A 
        business entity shall, upon the request of the Commission, 
        provide records or other evidence of the notifications required 
        under this section.
            (2) Reasonable delay.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subsection 
                (d), reasonable delay under this subsection shall not 
                exceed 30 days, unless the business entity seeking 
                additional time requests an extension of time and the 
                Commission determines that additional time is 
                reasonably necessary to determine the scope of the 
                security breach, prevent further disclosures, conduct 
                the risk assessment, restore the reasonable integrity 
                of the data system, or provide notice to the breach 
                notification entity.
                    (B) Extension.--If the Commission determines that 
                additional time is reasonably necessary as described in 
                subparagraph (A), the Commission may extend the time 
                period for notification for additional periods of up to 
                30 days each. Any such extension shall be provided in 
                writing by the Commission.
            (3) Burden of production.--If a business entity requires 
        additional time under paragraph (2), the business entity shall 
        provide the Commission with records or other evidence of the 
        reasons necessitating delay of notification.
    (d) Delay of Notification for Law Enforcement or National 
Security.--
            (1) In general.--If the Director of the United States 
        Secret Service or the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation determines that the notification required under 
        this section would impede a criminal investigation or national 
        security activity, the time period for notification shall be 
        extended 30 days upon written notice from such Director to the 
        business entity that experienced the breach.
            (2) Extended delay of notification.--If the time period for 
        notification required under subsection (a) is extended pursuant 
        to paragraph (1), a business entity shall provide the 
        notification within such time period unless the Director of the 
        United States Secret Service or the Director of the Federal 
        Bureau of Investigation provides written notification that 
        further extension of the time period is necessary. The Director 
        of the United States Secret Service or the Director of the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation may extend the time period for 
        additional periods of up to 30 days each.
            (3) Immunity.--No cause of action for which jurisdiction is 
        based under section 1346(b) of title 28, United States Code, 
        shall lie against any Federal law enforcement agency for acts 
        relating to the extension of the deadline for notification for 
        law enforcement or national security purposes under this 
        section.
    (e) Designation of Breach Notification Entity.--Not later than 60 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall designate a Federal Government entity to 
receive notices, reports, and information about information security 
incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities under this title.

            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 101, if the 
        Director of the United States Secret Service or the Director of 
        the Federal Bureau of Investigation determines that 
        notification of the security breach required by such section 
        could be expected to reveal sensitive sources and methods or 
        similarly impede the ability of a Federal, State, or local law 
        enforcement agency to conduct law enforcement investigations, 
        or if the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
        determines that notification of the security breach could be 
        expected to cause damage to national security, such 
        notification is not required.
            (2) Immunity.--No cause of action for which jurisdiction is 
        based under section 1346(b) of title 28, United States Code, 
        shall lie against any Federal law enforcement agency for acts 
        relating to the extension of the deadline for notification for 
        law enforcement or national security purposes under this 
        section.
    (b) Safe Harbor.--
            (1) In general.--A business entity is exempt from the 
        notification requirement under section 101, if the following 
        requirements are met:
                    (A) Risk assessment.--A risk assessment, in 
                accordance with paragraph (3), is conducted by or on 
                behalf of the business entity that concludes that there 
                is no reasonable risk that a security breach has 
                resulted in, or will result in, harm to the individuals 
                whose sensitive personally identifiable information was 
                subject to the security breach.
                    (B) Notice to commission.--Without unreasonable 
                delay and not later than 30 days after the discovery of 
                a security breach, unless extended by the Commission, 
                the Director of the United States Secret Service, or 
                the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
                under section 101 (in which case, before the extended 
                deadline), the business entity notifies the Commission, 
                in writing, of--
                            (i) the results of the risk assessment; and
                            (ii) the decision by the business entity to 
                        invoke the risk assessment exemption described 
                        under subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Determination by commission.--During the period 
                beginning on the date on which the notification 
                described in subparagraph (B) is submitted and ending 
                10 days after such date, the Commission has not issued 
                a determination in writing that a notification should 
                be provided under section 101.
            (2) Rebuttable presumption.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1)--

                generally accepted by experts in the field of 
                information security shall establish a rebuttable 
                presumption that such reasonable risk does not exist; 
                and
                    (B) any such presumption shall be rebuttable by 
                facts demonstrating that the security technologies or 
                methodologies in a specific case have been, or are 
                reasonably likely to have been, compromised.
            (3) Risk assessment requirements.--A risk assessment is in 
        accordance with this paragraph if the following requirements

                            (i) for each communication or attempted 
                        communication with a database or data system 
                        containing sensitive personally identifiable 
                        information, the data system communication

                        communication, including any Internet 
                        addresses, and the date and time associated

            (1) In general.--A business entity is exempt from the 
        notification requirement under section 101 if the business

                personally identifiable information to initiate 
                unauthorized financial transactions before they are 
                charged to the account of the individual; and
                    (B) provides notification to affected individuals

        apply if the information subject to the security breach

        credit card number or credit card security code.

not exceed 30 days following the discovery of a security breach, except 
as provided in subsection (c) or (d) of section 101 (in which case,

notification can demonstrate to the Commission that additional time is 
reasonably necessary to determine the scope of the security breach, 
prevent further disclosures, conduct the risk assessment, restore the 
reasonable integrity of the data system, and provide notice to the 
breach notification entity. If the Commission determines that 
additional time is necessary, the Commission may extend the time period 
for notification for additional periods of up to 30 days each. Any such 
extension shall be provided in writing.

        500,000 individuals nationwide;
            (3) the security breach involves databases owned by the 
        Federal Government; or
            (4) the security breach involves primarily sensitive

        business entity to be employees and contractors of the Federal 
        Government involved in national security or law enforcement.
    (b) Regulations.--Not later than one year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations (in

consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, that describe what information is required to be included in
