        eliminate duplicative environmental reviews and approvals under 
        State and Federal law of projects. Under this program, a State 
        may use State laws and procedures to conduct reviews and make

        regulations, consistent with the provisions of this section.
            (2) Participating states.--All States are eligible to 
        participate in the program.

        and approval procedures may include one or more of the 
        following:
                    (A) Substitution of one or more State environmental 
                laws for one or more Federal environmental laws, if the 
                Secretary determines in accordance with this section 
                that the State environmental laws provide environmental 
                protection and opportunities for public involvement 
                that are substantially equivalent to the applicable 
                Federal environmental laws.
                    (B) Substitution of one or more State regulations 
                for Federal regulations implementing one or more 
                Federal environmental laws, if the Secretary determines 
                in accordance with this section that the State 
                regulations provide environmental protection and 
                opportunities for public involvement that are 
                substantially equivalent to the Federal regulations.
    (b) Application.--To participate in the program, a State shall 
submit to the Secretary an application containing such information as 
the Secretary may require, including--
            (1) a full and complete description of the proposed 
        alternative environmental review and approval procedures of the 
        State;
            (2) for each State law or regulation included in the 
        proposed alternative environmental review and approval 
        procedures of the State, an explanation of the basis for 
        concluding that the law or regulation meets the requirements 
        under subsection (a)(3); and
            (3) evidence of having sought, received, and addressed 
        comments on the proposed application from the public and 
        appropriate Federal environmental resource agencies.
    (c) Review of Application.--The Secretary shall--
            (1) review an application submitted under subsection (b);
            (2) approve or disapprove the application in accordance 
        with subsection (d) not later than 90 days after the date of 
        the receipt of the application; and
            (3) transmit to the State notice of the approval or 
        disapproval, together with a statement of the reasons for the 
        approval or disapproval.
    (d) Approval of State Programs.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall approve each such 
        application if the Secretary finds that the proposed 
        alternative environmental review and approval procedures of the 
        State are substantially equivalent to the applicable Federal

        this section.
    (e) Compliance With Permits.--Compliance with a permit or other 
approval of a project issued pursuant to a program approved by the
