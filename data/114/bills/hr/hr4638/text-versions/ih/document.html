                    ``(D) may choose to carry out periodic auctions for 
                the sale of a venture security instead of providing 
                continuous trading of the venture security; and
                    ``(E) may not extend unlisted trading privileges to

                        the threshold specified in clause (i)(II) until 
                        the end of the period of 12 consecutive months 
                        during which the market capitalization of such 
                        issuer exceeds $1,500,000,000.

Securities and Exchange Commission should--

        the Commission's general exemptive authority under section 36 
        of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78mm) with 
        respect to the provisions added by this section; and
            (2) if the Commission determines appropriate, create an 
        Office of Venture Exchanges within the Commission's Division of 
        Trading and Markets.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or the 
amendments made by this section shall be construed to impair or limit 
the construction of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws (as 
defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78c(a))) or the authority of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission under those provisions.
    (e) Effective Date for Tiers of Existing National Securities 
Exchanges.--In the case of a securities exchange that is registered as 
a national securities exchange under section 6 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, any election for a listing tier of such exchange to be 
treated as a venture exchange under subsection (m) of such section 
shall not take effect before the date that is 180 days after such date 
of enactment.
