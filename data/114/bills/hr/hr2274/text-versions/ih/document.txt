                                 A BILL


 
     To authorize the National Emergency Medical Services Memorial 
    Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District of 
           Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Each year, in every corner of the Nation, the 850,000 
        first responders of Emergency Medical Services answer more than 
        30,000,000 calls to serve 22,000,000 patients in need of life 
        saving care and comfort at a moment's notice and without 
        reservation. With little regard for their own safety and in the 
        face of all hazards the men and women of Emergency Medical 
        Services respond across the spectrum of incidents from a single 
        person's medical emergency to the naturally occurring or man-
        made disasters, including terrorist attacks that threaten the 
        entire Nation. This commitment to others, at a moment's notice 
        and despite risk, exemplifies the finest traditions of American 
        spirit.
            (2) As an element of the Nation's homeland defense 
        strategy, Emergency Medical Services stands on the ``Nation's 
        first line of defense in the prevention and mitigation of risk 
        from terrorist attacks, man-made incidents, and natural 
        disasters.''. The men and women of Emergency Medical Services, 
        alongside those in Law Enforcement and the Fire Service, 
        serving in both the public and private sectors as career and 
        volunteer emergency medical service providers, are a critical 
        element of the Nation's homeland and national security efforts 
        and provide for the domestic tranquility of its citizens.
            (3) All too often the risks associated with the critical 
        role of Emergency Medical Services results in an unacceptable 
        rate of injury and fatality to these responders. Statistics 
        compiled by the United States Department of Labor and the 
        National Highway Safety Administration indicate that emergency 
        medical services providers die in the line of duty at a rate 
        more than twice the national average for all occupational 
        fatalities and during their careers experience an injury rate 
        of virtually 100 percent.
            (4) We as a Nation have historically and continually relied 
        on the selfless and ultimate sacrifices made by the men and 
        women of this great country, their families, and loved ones in 
        order to maintain the domestic tranquility, safety, and 
        security of this Nation. The men and women of Emergency Medical 
        Services continue to serve in this finest tradition, in the 
        face of unacceptable sacrifice, risk and danger in service to 
        the Nation and its citizens.
            (5) The scope of responsibility assumed by the men and 
        women of the Emergency Medical Services is broad and unique and 
        their sacrifice and commitment in service to our Nation are 
        deserving of a commemorative work that recognizes such.
