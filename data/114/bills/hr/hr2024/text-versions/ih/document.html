                                 A BILL


 
  To require mobile service providers and smartphone manufacturers to 
give consumers the ability to remotely delete data from smartphones and 
                     render smartphones inoperable.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smartphone Theft Prevention Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) mobile device theft costs consumers billions of dollars 
        each year, according to the Federal Communications Commission;
            (2) 1 in 3 robberies include the theft of a mobile device;
            (3) carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, the Federal 
        Communications Commission, and State governments have worked to 
        address the growing trend of mobile device theft, but more 
        remains to be done;
            (4) consumers deserve to have the most secure technology 
        available to protect them and their information;
            (5) technological protections continue to develop, evolve, 
        and improve in ways that are good for the economy and the 
        consumers of the United States, and for public safety in the 
        United States;
            (6) the wireless industry should work with law enforcement 
        to educate consumers about the security tools that are 
        available to them and how to keep their data, their devices, 
        and themselves safe;
            (7) because engineering and security needs change rapidly, 
        the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer 
        advocates are best suited to proactively develop solutions to 
        protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft; and
            (8) major cities such as San Francisco, New York, and 
        London have seen recent decreases in smartphone theft since 
        carriers and manufacturers began rolling out sophisticated new 
        technological functions to protect consumers from theft.
