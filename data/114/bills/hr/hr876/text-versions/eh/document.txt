        access hospital, with respect to each individual who receives 
        observation services as an outpatient at such hospital or 
        critical access hospital for more than 24 hours, to provide to 
        such individual not later than 36 hours after the time such 
        individual begins receiving such services (or, if sooner, upon 
        release)--
                    ``(i) such oral explanation of the written 
                notification described in clause (ii), and such

                        and not as an inpatient of the hospital or 
                        critical access hospital and the reasons for 
                        such status of such individual;
