[H.R. 91 Engrossed Amendment Senate (EAS)]

                  In the Senate of the United States,

                                                         June 22, 2015.
    Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives (H.R. 91) 
entitled ``An Act to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue, upon request, veteran 
identification cards to certain veterans.'', do pass with the following

                               AMENDMENT:

            Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
      following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Identification Card Act 
2015''.

SEC. 2. VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, veteran identification cards were issued to 
        veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-
        service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or who 
        have received a medical-related discharge from the Armed 
        Forces.
            (2) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, a veteran who served a minimum obligated time in 
        service, but who did not meet the criteria described in 
        paragraph (1), did not receive a means of identifying the 
        veteran's status as a veteran other than using the Department 
        of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers of the veteran.
            (3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often 
        offered by public and private institutions to veterans who 
        demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is 
        impractical for a veteran to always carry Department of Defense 
        form DD-214 discharge papers to demonstrate such proof.
            (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made 
        available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the status 
        of the veterans without having to carry and use official 
        Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers.
            (5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs had the infrastructure 
        in place across the United States to produce photographic 
        identification cards and accept a small payment to cover the 
        cost of these cards.
    (b) Provision of Veteran Identification Cards.--Chapter 57 of title 
38, United States Code, is amended by adding after section 5705 the 
following new section:
``Sec. 5706. Veterans identification card
    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall issue an 
identification card described in subsection (b) to each veteran who--

        or other official document from the official military personnel 
        file of the veteran that describes the service of the veteran;

            ``(3) explains that such card is not proof of any benefits 
        to which the veteran is entitled to;
            ``(4) contains an identification number that is not a 
        social security number; and
            ``(5) serves as proof that such veteran--
                    ``(A) served in the Armed Forces; and
                    ``(B) has a Department of Defense form DD-214 or 
                other official document in the official military

        appropriation Acts; and
            ``(C) subject to the same conditions and limitations as 
        amounts otherwise in such account.

identification cards otherwise provided by the Secretary to veterans 
enrolled in the health care system established under section 1705(a) of 
this title.''.
