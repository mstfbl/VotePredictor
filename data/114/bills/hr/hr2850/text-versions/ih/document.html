                                 A BILL


 
            To prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Overdose Stat Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, each day in the United States, more than 100 people 
        die from a drug overdose. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug 
        overdose causes more deaths than motor vehicle accidents.
            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 
        that nearly 44,000 people in the United States died from a drug 
        overdose in 2013 alone. More than 80 percent of those deaths 
        were due to unintentional drug overdoses, and many could have 
        been prevented.
            (3) Deaths resulting from unintentional drug overdoses 
        increased more than 300 percent between 1980 and 1998, and more 
        than tripled between 1999 and 2013.
            (4) Nearly 92 percent of all unintentional poisoning deaths 
        are due to drugs. Since 1999, in the United States the 
        population of non-Hispanic Whites and the population of Indians 
        (as defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and 
        Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) have seen the 
        highest rates of unintentional drug poisoning deaths.
            (5) Opioid medications such as oxycodone and hydrocodone 
        were involved in nearly 46 percent of all unintentional drug 
        poisoning deaths in 2013.
            (6) Unintentional drug poisoning deaths involving heroin 
        nearly tripled between 2010 and 2013 and were 23 percent of all 
        unintentional drug poisoning deaths in 2013.
            (7) Between 1999 and 2010, opioid medication overdose 
        fatalities increased by more than 400 percent among women and 
        265 percent among men.
            (8) Military veterans are at elevated risk of experiencing 
        a drug overdose. Veterans who served in Vietnam, Iraq, or 
        Afghanistan and who have combat injuries, posttraumatic stress 
        disorder, and other co-occurring mental health diagnoses are at 
        elevated risk of fatal drug overdose from opioid medications.
            (9) Rural and suburban regions are disproportionately 
        affected by opioid medication and heroin overdoses. From 2000 
        through 2013, the age-adjusted rate for drug poisoning deaths 
        involving heroin has increased nearly 11-fold in the Midwest 
        region and more than 3-fold in the South region.
            (10) Urban centers also continue to struggle with overdose, 
        which is the leading cause of death among homeless adults.
            (11) In 2009 alone, estimated lost productivity and direct 
        medical costs from opioid medication poisonings exceeded 
        $20,000,000,000.
            (12) Opioid medication poisonings cost health insurers an 
        estimated $72,000,000,000 annually in medical costs.
            (13) Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses place a heavy burden 
        on public health and public safety resources, yet there is no 
        coordinated cross-Federal agency response to prevent overdose 
        fatalities.
            (14) Naloxone is a medication that rapidly reverses 
        overdose from heroin and opioid medications.
            (15) Naloxone has no pharmacological effect if administered 
        to a person who has not taken opioids and has no potential for 
        abuse. Naloxone provides additional time to obtain necessary 
        medical assistance during an overdose.
            (16) Lawmakers in Arkansas, California, Colorado, 
        Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, 
        Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
        Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
        Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
        Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, 
        West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia have 
        removed legal impediments to increasing naloxone prescription 
        and its use by bystanders who are in a position to respond to 
        an overdose.
            (17) The American Medical Association and the American 
        Public Health Association support further implementation of 
        community-based programs that offer naloxone and other opioid 
        overdose prevention services.
            (18) Community-based overdose prevention programs have 
        successfully prevented deaths from opioid overdoses by making 
        rescue training and naloxone available to first responders, 
        parents, and other bystanders who may encounter an overdose. A 
        study funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        of community-based overdose prevention programs provided by the 
        Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that 
        communities with access to overdose prevention programs 
        experienced lower mortality rates from opioid overdoses than 
        communities that did not have access to overdose prevention 
        programs during the study period.
            (19) Over 150,000 potential bystanders have been trained by 
        overdose prevention programs in the United States. A Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention report credits overdose 
        prevention programs with reversing more than 26,000 overdoses 
        since 1996.
            (20) At least 188 local overdose prevention programs are 
        operating in the United States, including in major cities such 
        as Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, San 
        Francisco, and Philadelphia, and statewide in New Mexico, 
        Massachusetts, and New York. Between December 2007 and March 
        2014, overdose prevention programs facilitated by the 
        Massachusetts Department of Public Health trained more than 
        22,500 people who reported more than 2,655 rescues. Since 2004, 
        a program administered by the Baltimore City Health Department 
        has trained more than 11,000 people who reported more than 220 
        rescues. Project Lazarus, an overdose prevention program in 
        Wilkes County, North Carolina, reduced overdose deaths 69 
        percent between 2009 and 2011.
            (21) In Illinois, the Department of Human Services, 
        Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse has enrolled over 20 
        drug overdose prevention programs with over 100 designated 
        sites across Illinois targeting multiple service populations. 
        These enrollees include police departments, county health 
        departments, medical facilities, licensed substance abuse 
        treatment programs, and community organizations. Statewide, 
        over 2,000 police officers and more than 600 others have been 
        trained thus far. The DuPage County Illinois Health Department 
        has trained over 1,200 police officers and has reported 34 
        overdose reversals in 2014 alone.
            (22) The Office of National Drug Control Policy supports 
        equipping first responders to help reverse overdoses. Police 
        officers on patrol in Quincy, Massachusetts, have conducted 300 
        overdose rescues with naloxone since 2011. The police 
        department has reported a 95-percent success rate with overdose 
        rescue attempts by police officers. In Suffolk County, New 
        York, police officers have saved more than 563 lives with 
        naloxone in 2013 alone.
            (23) Research shows that the cost per year of life gained 
        by making naloxone available to reverse overdoses is within the 
        range of what people in the United States usually pay for 
        health treatments.
            (24) Prompt administration of naloxone and provision of 
        emergency care by a bystander can reduce health complications 
        and health care costs that arise when a person is deprived of 
        oxygen for an extended period of time.
            (25) Overdose prevention programs are needed in 
        correctional facilities, addiction treatment programs, and 
        other places where people are at higher risk of overdosing 
        after a period of abstinence.
            (26) Timely, drug-specific fatal and nonfatal surveillance 
        data at the local, State, and regional level is critically 
        needed to target prevention efforts.
            (27) People affected by drug overdose gather on August 31 
        of each year in communities nationwide for Overdose Awareness 
        Day, to mourn and pay tribute to loved ones and raise awareness 
        about overdose risk and prevention.

SEC. 4. OVERDOSE PREVENTION RESEARCH.

    Subpart 15 of part C of title IV of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 285o et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 464Q. OVERDOSE PREVENTION RESEARCH.

    ``(a) Overdose Research.--The Director of the Institute shall 
prioritize and conduct or support research on drug overdose and 
overdose prevention. The primary aims of this research shall include--
            ``(1) an examination of circumstances that contribute to
