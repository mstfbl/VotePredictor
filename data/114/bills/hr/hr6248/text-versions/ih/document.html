        paragraphs (2) (A) and (B), the cost of the program shall be

        Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (2 U.S.C. 933).
    (b) Spending Safeguard Limitation Scorecards.--

        that is subject to a spending safeguard limitation pursuant to 
        this Act.
            (2) Monthly costs.--Not later than 7 days after the end of

        the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate 
        containing the total level of spending for any such direct 
        spending program and the relation between such level and the
