                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to convene a panel of citizens 
   to make a recommendation to the Secretary regarding featuring the 
 likeness of a woman on the twenty dollar bill, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Woman on the Twenty Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1875, Congress adopted the dollar as the monetary 
        unit of the United States.
            (2) In 1877, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the 
        Department of the Treasury began printing all United States 
        paper money.
            (3) The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created the Federal 
        Reserve as the Nation's central bank and provided for a 
        national banking system. The Board of Governors of the Federal 
        Reserve System issued new paper money called Federal Reserve 
        notes.
            (4) The Secretary of the Treasury usually selects the 
        designs shown on Federal Reserve notes with the advice of the 
        Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
            (5) United States Federal Reserve notes now in production 
        bear the following portraits:
                    (A) President George Washington on the $1 bill.
                    (B) President Thomas Jefferson on the $2 bill.
                    (C) President Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill.
                    (D) Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill.
                    (E) President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.
                    (F) President Ulysses S. Grant on the $50 bill.
                    (G) Benjamin Franklin on the $100 bill.
            (6) There are also several denominations of Federal Reserve 
        notes that are no longer produced. These include the $500 bill 
        with the portrait of President William McKinley, the $1,000 
        bill with a portrait of President Grover Cleveland, the $5,000 
        bill with a portrait of President James Madison, the $10,000 
        bill with a portrait of Salmon P. Chase, and the $100,000 bill 
        with a portrait of President Woodrow Wilson.
            (7) However, since the first general circulation of paper 
        money, no woman has ever held the honor of being featured on 
        paper money.

SEC. 3. CITIZENS PANEL RELATING TO THE LIKENESS OF A WOMAN TO BE 
              INCLUDED ON THE $20 FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall convene a 
panel of private citizens of the United States--
            (1) to consider and analyze public input regarding 
        suggestions for the likeness of a woman to appear on the $20 
        Federal Reserve note; and
            (2) to make recommendations to the Secretary based on such 
        input.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after receiving the 
recommendations described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit 
to Congress a report that includes such recommendations and a 
determination as to whether the likeness of a woman shall appear on the 
$20 Federal Reserve note.
                                 <all>
