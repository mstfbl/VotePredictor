                                 A BILL


 
To exclude vehicles used solely for competition from certain provisions 
             of the Clean Air Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Recognizing the Protection of 
Motorsports Act of 2016'' or the ``RPM Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) at the time the Clean Air Act was written, and each 
        time the Clean Air Act has been amended, the intent of Congress 
        has been, and continues to be, that vehicles manufactured for, 
        modified for, or utilized in organized motorized racing events 
        would not be encompassed by the Clean Air Act's definition of 
        ``motor vehicle'';
            (2) when Congress sought to regulate nonroad vehicles in 
        1990, it explicitly excluded from the definition of ``nonroad 
        vehicle'' any vehicle used solely for competition;
            (3) despite the clear intent of Congress, the Environmental 
        Protection Agency has cited the Clean Air Act as authority for 
        regulating vehicles used solely for competition; and
            (4) the Environmental Protection Agency has exceeded its 
        statutory authority in its recent actions to regulate vehicles 
        used solely for competition.

SEC. 3. EXCLUSION OF VEHICLES USED SOLELY FOR COMPETITION FROM THE 
              ANTI-TAMPERING PROVISIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

    Section 203 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7522) is amended by 
adding at the end of subsection (a) the following: ``No action with 
respect to any device or element of design referred to in paragraph (3) 
shall be treated as a prohibited act under that paragraph if the action 
is for the purpose of modifying a motor vehicle into a vehicle to be 
used solely for competition.''.

SEC. 4. EXCLUSION OF VEHICLES USED SOLELY FOR COMPETITION FROM THE 
              DEFINITION OF MOTOR VEHICLE IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

    Section 216 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7550) is amended by 
striking ``.'' at the end of paragraph (2) and inserting ``and that is 
not a vehicle used solely for competition, including any vehicle so 
used that was converted from a motor vehicle.''.

SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION.

    Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall finalize 
any regulations necessary to implement the amendments made by this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
