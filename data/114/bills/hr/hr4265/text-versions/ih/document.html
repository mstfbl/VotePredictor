    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Air Implementation Act of

    The table of contents of this Act is as follows:

Sec. 1. Short title.
Sec. 2. Table of contents.
Sec. 3. Timeline for review of national ambient air quality standards.
Sec. 4. Consideration of technological feasibility.

SEC. 3. TIMELINE FOR REVIEW OF NATIONAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS.

    Section 109(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409(d)) is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraphs (1) and (2)(B), by striking ``at five-
        year intervals'' each place it appears and inserting ``at 8-
        year intervals'';
            (2) in paragraph (1), by striking the last sentence; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(3) Whenever the national ambient air quality standard for an air 
pollutant is revised pursuant to this subsection, the next 8-year 
interval for such air pollutant under paragraphs (1) and (2)(B) shall 
be calculated beginning on the date of finalization of such revised 
standard.
    ``(4) The Administrator, in consultation with relevant State air 
quality officials, may review and revise criteria or promulgate new 
standards earlier or more frequently than required under paragraph 
(1).''.

Administrator, in consultation with the independent scientific review 
committee under subsection (d), finds that a range of levels of air 
quality for an air pollutant are requisite to protect human health with 
an adequate margin of safety, as described in the preceding sentence, 
the Administrator may consider, as a secondary consideration, likely 
technological feasibility in establishing and revising the national 
primary ambient air quality standard for such pollutant.''.

SEC. 5. EMISSIONS EMANATING FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Consideration of State Petitions.--Section 179B of the Clean

demonstrate that the standard described in (a)(2) or (c) is met, the 
Administrator shall consider such petition to be approvable if the 
preponderance of the evidence indicates that such standard is 
satisfied.''.
    (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than 24 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, in coordination with the National Academy of 
Science, shall submit a report to the Congress on--
            (1) the extent to which foreign sources of air pollution 
        impact achievement and maintenance of national ambient air 
        quality standards under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et 
        seq.); and
            (2) the extent to which such Act successfully takes such

                    (A) suspend the application and implementation of

                report required by subsection (b) is submitted to the 
                Congress; and
                    (B) extend each deadline in the rule cited in
