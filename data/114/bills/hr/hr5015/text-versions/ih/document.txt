                                 A BILL


 
To restore amounts improperly withheld for tax purposes from severance 
 payments to individuals who retired or separated from service in the 
   Armed Forces for combat-related injuries, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combat-Injured Veterans Tax Fairness 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Approximately 10,000 to 11,000 individuals are retired 
        from service in the Armed Forces for medical reasons each year.
            (2) Some of such individuals are separated from service in 
        the Armed Forces for combat-related injuries (as defined in 
        section 104(b)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986).
            (3) Congress has recognized the tremendous personal 
        sacrifice of veterans with combat-related injuries by, among 
        other things, specifically excluding from taxable income 
        severance pay received for combat-related injuries.
            (4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly 
        withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus 
        denying them their due compensation and a significant benefit 
        intended by Congress.
            (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory 
        period to file an amended tax return because they were not or 
        are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld.

SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF AMOUNTS IMPROPERLY WITHHELD FOR TAX PURPOSES 
              FROM SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO VETERANS WITH COMBAT-RELATED 
              INJURIES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall--
            (1) identify--

                            (i) that the Secretary paid after January 
                        17, 1991;

                        section 1212 of title 10, United States Code;
                            (iii) that were not considered gross income 
                        pursuant to section 104(a)(4) of the Internal

                        paragraph (1)(A) which were improperly withheld 
                        for tax purposes; and
                            (ii) such other information determined to

        (a)(1).
