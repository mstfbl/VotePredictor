_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for the restoration of legal rights for claimants under 
                   holocaust-era insurance policies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Holocaust Insurance Accountability 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) allow for the enforcement of State laws requiring the 
        disclosure of information about Holocaust-era insurance 
        policies, notwithstanding the holding of the Supreme Court of 
        the United States in American Insurance Association v. 
        Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396 (2003) that such laws are preempted by 
        the foreign policy espoused by the executive branch of the 
        Federal Government addressed in that case;
            (2) facilitate the disclosure of information about 
        Holocaust-era insurance policies under applicable State laws so 
        that citizens of the United States (and other persons on whose 
        behalf such laws were enacted) may know whether they hold any 
        rights under the policies;
            (3) allow the beneficiaries of Holocaust-era insurance 
        policies, many of whom are citizens of the United States, to 
        bring suits in the courts of the United States to recover any 
        proceeds under the policies to which they may be entitled, 
        notwithstanding the defense that such suits are preempted by 
        the executive branch foreign policy addressed in Garamendi;
            (4) foreclose defenses to claims brought under section 4 of 
        this Act arising from any prior judgments or settlement 
        agreements (including the class action judgment and settlement 
        agreement (M21-89, United States District Court for the 
        Southern District of New York) in In re: Assicurazioni General 
        S.p.A. Holocaust Insurance Litigation) that were entered and 
        approved based on the erroneous conclusion that State-law 
        claims to recover under Holocaust-era insurance claims are 
        preempted by the executive branch foreign policy addressed in 
        Garamendi;
            (5) provide for a uniform statute of limitations of 10 
        years after the date of enactment of this Act in any action to 
        recover under Holocaust-era insurance policies under this Act 
        or State law; and
            (6) in carrying out the purposes described in paragraphs 
        (1) through (5), preserve the lawmaking powers of Congress 
        under article I of the Constitution of the United States, with 
        which the judicial decisions cited in this section are 
        inconsistent.
