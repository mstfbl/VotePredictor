                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Incentive Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs 
 under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to 
    add gender-responsive services to the list of authorized grant 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Improving the 
Juvenile Justice System for Girls Act of 2016''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The proportion of girls entering the justice system has 
        increased steadily over the past several decades, and girls are 
        among the fastest growing segment of the juvenile justice 
        population. In 1991, around 20 percent of the juvenile arrests 
        were girls. By 2012, girls represented nearly 30 percent.
            (2) Girls' pathways into juvenile justice involvement are 
        distinct from boys' pathways. Girls account for a much larger 
        proportion of nonviolent status offenders than delinquency 
        offenders (40 percent compared to 14 percent, respectively).
            (3) Girls are, on average, younger than boys when they 
        enter the juvenile justice system and frequently experience 
        multiple traumatic events.
            (4) The trauma of untreated physical and sexual abuse 
        results in lifetime consequences for girls. These consequences 
        include a higher risk for a number of negative social and 
        health outcomes such as higher mortality rates, a variety of 
        psychiatric problems, dysfunctional and violent relationships, 
        poor educational achievement, less stable work histories, 
        increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases and early 
        pregnancy, substance abuse or addiction, and increased reliance 
        on social services as compared to non-delinquent girls.
            (5) A growing body of evidence suggests that girls who 
        enter the juvenile justice system have equal if not higher 
        rates of mental health issues than boys who enter the system.
            (6) Current research and data have shown that gender-
        responsive, strength-based programming providing trauma-
        informed care and trauma-specific services is the most 
        effective means of preventing juvenile offenses and reducing 
        recidivism.

SEC. 2. INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR LOCAL DELINQUENCY PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

    The second title V of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1974 (relating to Incentive Grants for Local 
Delinquency Prevention Programs, as added by Public Law 102-586 and 
amended by Public Law 107-273) is amended--
