                                 A BILL


 
                   To support Promise Neighborhoods.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promise Neighborhoods Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Between 2007 and 2009, the number of children in the 
        United States living in poverty increased by 2,200,000, to 
        15,500,000 children.
            (2) According to the National Center for Children in 
        Poverty, the number of poor children under age 6 increased by 
        24 percent between 2000 and 2007. The Center also found that, 
        in Iowa, 20 percent of children under age 6 live in poor 
        families.
            (3) According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
        and Development (OECD), in 2008, the United States had a child 
        poverty rate of 20.6 percent, making the United States the OECD 
        nation with the fourth worst level of child poverty. Of the 4 
        most developed countries in the world, the United States has 
        the highest rate of child poverty.
            (4) According to the National Center for Children in 
        Poverty, at age 4, children who live below the poverty line are 
        18 months below normal learning and achievement for their age 
        group, and by age 10 that gap is still present. For children 
        living in the poorest families, the gap is even larger.
            (5) Children from low-income families are more likely to 
        have low levels of school engagement, to be chronically absent 
        from school, to have emotional and behavioral problems, and to 
        live in stressful home environments.
            (6) By age 3, children in low-income homes will have heard 
        one-third as many words as children in middle-income and high-
        income homes.
            (7) Studies show that children who attend high-quality 
        early childhood education programs are less likely to repeat 
        grades, less likely to be assigned to special education, and 
        more likely to perform better on standardized tests, experience 
        reduced rates of teenage pregnancy, and graduate from high 
        school. Additionally, such children are less likely to engage 
        in criminal behavior and more likely to obtain employment at 
        higher wages. Economically disadvantaged children gain even 
        larger benefits from such high-quality programs.
            (8) Compared with children in kindergarten from low-income 
        families, children in kindergarten from high-income families 
        live in homes with 3 times the number of books and such 
        children are 4 times as likely to have a computer at home. 
        Children from high-income families also watch far less 
        television and are more likely to visit museums or libraries.
            (9) By the time children from low-income families enter 
        kindergarten, they are already 3 months behind the national 
        average in reading and mathematics skills, a gap that persists 
        through high school.
            (10) A child from a middle-income family typically enters 
        first grade with about 1,000 hours of one-on-one picture book 
        reading time with parents, other relatives, or teachers, but a 
        child from a low-income family averages less than 100 hours of 
        such reading time.
            (11) The percentage of households with children reporting 
        food insecurity (limited or uncertain access to nutritious, 
        safe foods) increased by 25 percent between 2007 and 2008. Poor 
        nutrition is linked to behavioral problems, lower educational 
        performance, and delayed socio-emotional development.
            (12) Twenty-nine percent of high-achieving 8th graders from 
        low-income families complete college. This is the same rate of 
        college completion as low-achieving 8th graders from high-
        income families.
            (13) About one-fourth of all students who start 9th grade 
        will not graduate 4 years later. For African-American and 
        Latino students, that figure increases to 40 percent. A 16- to 
        24-year-old coming from a high-income family is about 7 times 
        as likely to have completed high school as a 16- to 24-year-old 
        coming from a low-income family.
            (14) The average annual cost to incarcerate a youth in the 
        United States is approximately $88,000, while per pupil annual 
        spending for a student in kindergarten through grade 12 is 
        $10,000.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to significantly improve academic 
outcomes, including school readiness, high school graduation, and 
college entry and success of children living in our Nation's most 
distressed neighborhoods, by using data-driven decisionmaking and 
existing external resources to provide children in such neighborhoods 
with access to a community-based continuum of high-quality pipeline 
services that include access to early learning opportunities, high-
quality schools, and best available evidence that address the needs of 
such children from birth through college and career.
