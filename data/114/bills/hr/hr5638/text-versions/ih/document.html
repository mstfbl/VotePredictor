SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Solar Fuels Innovation Act''.

SEC. 2. SOLAR FUELS BASIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 973 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 
U.S.C. 16313) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 973. SOLAR FUELS BASIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE.

    ``(a) Initiative.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall carry out a research 
        initiative, to be known as the Solar Fuels Basic Research 
        Initiative, to expand theoretical and fundamental knowledge of 
        photochemistry, electrochemistry, biochemistry, and materials 
        science useful for the practical development of experimental 
        systems to convert solar energy to chemical energy.
            ``(2) Leveraging.--The Secretary shall leverage expertise 
        and resources from the Basic Energy Sciences Program and 
        Biological and Environmental Research Program within the Office 
        of Science, and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
        Energy, as provided under subsections (b) and (c).
            ``(3) Teams.--The Secretary shall organize activities under 
        the Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative to include 
        multidisciplinary teams leveraging expertise from the National 
        Laboratories, universities, and the private sector to the 
        extent practicable. These multidisciplinary teams shall pursue 
        aggressive, milestone-driven basic research goals. The 
        Secretary shall provide sufficient resources for those teams to 
        achieve those goals over a period of time to be determined by 
        the Secretary.
            ``(4) Additional activities.--The Secretary is authorized 
        to organize additional activities under this subsection through 
        Energy Frontier Research Centers or other organizational 
        structures.
    ``(b) Artificial Photosynthesis.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, as part of the 
        Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative, carry out a program to 
        support research needed to bridge scientific barriers and 
        discover knowledge relevant to artificial photosynthetic 
        systems. In carrying out activities under this subsection, the 
        Director of the Office of Basic Energy Sciences shall support 
        basic research to pursue distinct lines of scientific inquiry, 
        including photoinduced production of hydrogen and oxygen from 
        water, and the sustainable photoinduced reduction of carbon 
        dioxide to fuel products including hydrocarbons, alcohols, 
        carbon monoxide, and natural gas. The Assistant Secretary for 
        Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy shall support 
        translational research, development, and validation of physical 
        concepts developed under this subsection.
            ``(2) Standard of review.--The Secretary shall review the 
        program activities under this subsection to determine the 
        achievement of technical milestones.
            ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--
                    ``(A) Authorization.--Subject to subsection (d), 
                there are authorized for carrying out activities under 
                this subsection for each of fiscal years 2017 through
