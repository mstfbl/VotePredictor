SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On April 2, 2015, in announcing a framework agreement 
        for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, President Obama 
        stated that ``other American sanctions on Iran for its support 
        of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile 
        program, will continue to be fully enforced''.
            (2) On July 14, 2015, President Obama stated that ``we will 
        maintain our own sanctions related to Iran's support for 
        terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights 
        violations''.
            (3) On January 16, 2016, President Obama stated that ``We 
        still have sanctions on Iran for its violations of human 
        rights, for its support of terrorism, and for its ballistic 
        missile program. And we will continue to enforce these 
        sanctions, vigorously.''.
            (4) On January 21, 2016, Secretary of State John Kerry 
        admitted that sanctions relief under the Joint Comprehensive 
        Plan of Action would go to terrorist organizations, stating: 
        ``I think that some of it will end up in the hands of the IRGC 
        or other entities, some of which are labeled terrorists . . . 
        You know, to some degree, I'm not going to sit here and tell 
        you that every component of that can be prevented.''.
            (5) Secretary of State John Kerry stated on July 23, 2015, 
        ``We will not violate the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
        (JCPOA)] if we use our authorities to impose sanctions on Iran 
        for terrorism, human rights, missiles, or other nonnuclear 
        reasons. And the JCPOA does not provide Iran any relief from 
        United States sanctions under any of those authorities or other 
        authorities.''.
            (6) Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wrote 
        on February 9, 2016, ``[T]he Islamic Republic of Iran presents 
        an enduring threat to U.S national interests because of its 
        support to regional terrorist and militant groups and the Assad 
        regime, as well as its development of advanced military 
        capabilities. Tehran views itself as leading the `axis of 
        resistance' which includes the Asad regime and sub-national 
        groups aligned with Iran, especially Lebanese Hezbollah and 
        Iraqi Shia militants . . . Tehran might even use American 
        citizens detained when entering Iranian territories as 
        bargaining pieces to achieve financial or political concessions 
        in line with heir strategic intentions.''.
            (7) Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew stated on July 14, 
        2015, ``We harbor no illusions about the Iranian government's 
        nefarious activities beyond its nuclear program. Make no 
        mistake: we will continue to impose and aggressively enforce 
        sanctions to combat Iran's support for terrorist groups, its 
        fomenting of violence in the region, and its perpetration of 
        human rights abuses.''.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Iran's ballistic missile program and support for 
        terrorism represents a serious threat to allies of the United 
        States in the Middle East and Europe, members of the Armed 
        Forces deployed in those regions, and ultimately the United 
        States; and
            (2) the United States should impose tough primary and 
        secondary sanctions against any person that directly or 
        indirectly supports the ballistic missile program of Iran, its 
        state sponsorship of terrorism and human rights abuses, as well 
        as against any foreign person or financial institution that 
        engages in transactions or trade that support those efforts.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to continue to impose pressure on the Government of 
        Iran for its role as the foremost state sponsor of terrorism, 
        its ongoing human rights abuses against the citizens of Iran 
        and other peoples, and its unjust detention of United States 
        citizens; and
            (2) to continue to use sanctions as an element of that 
        pressure and to discourage financial institutions and entities 
        from engaging in business and commerce with Iranian entities 
        tied to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and to Iranian 
        officials involved in human rights abuses.
