Defense during the preceding year covered by the report.

SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PLIGHT OF MALE VICTIMS OF MILITARY 
              SEXUAL TRAUMA.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the plight of male victims of 
military sexual trauma remains in the shadows due a lack of social 
awareness on the issue of male victimization.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should--
            (1) enhance victims' access to intensive medical and mental 
        health treatment for military sexual trauma treatment;
            (2) look for opportunities to utilize male survivors of 
        sexual assault as presenters during annual Sexual Assault 
        Preventions and Response training; and
            (3) ensure Department of Defense medical and mental health 
        providers are adequately trained to meet the needs of male 
        survivors of military sexual trauma.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
