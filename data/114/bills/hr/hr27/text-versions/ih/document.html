Act may not be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined

being present.
    (b) Rules of the Senate and House.--The provisions of subsection 
(a) are enacted by the Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as 
such they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, 
respectively, or of that House to which they specifically apply, and 
such rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are 
inconsistent therewith.
