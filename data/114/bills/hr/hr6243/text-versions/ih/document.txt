SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive 
Fentanyl Control Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Fentanyl is a dangerous, synthetic opioid that's 50 to 
        100 times more potent than heroin and morphine and lethal in 
        doses as small as approximately 2 milligrams. Current 
        sentencing enhancements do not reflect the danger fentanyl 
        poses at lower quantities compared to other illicit substances.
            (2) Because a lethal dose of fentanyl can be accidentally 
        inhaled or absorbed through the skin, it's not just deadly to 
        its users, but it also threatens the lives of law enforcement 
        and customs officials, public health workers, first responders 
        and postal workers who risk unknowingly coming into contact 
        with fentanyl in its different forms.
            (3) From 2013 to 2014, the number of drug seizures by law 
        enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl increased by 426 
        percent and synthetic opioid-related deaths increased by 79 
        percent, with over 700 overdose deaths related to fentanyl. 
        However, due to variations in States' medical examiner and 
        coroner testing and reporting techniques, and deaths attributed 
        to heroin, this figure is believed to be significantly higher.
            (4) Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, pill press machines, 
        and other supplies needed to manufacture counterfeit pills 
        containing fentanyl are primarily sourced from China and widely 
        available for purchase on the Internet. Traffickers can 
        typically purchase a kilogram of fentanyl powder for as little 
        as $2,000 from a Chinese supplier, transform it into hundreds 
        of thousands of pills, and sell the counterfeit pills for 
        millions of dollars in profit.
            (5) In 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued 
        nationwide alerts identifying fentanyl as a threat to public 
        health and safety and stating that the rise of counterfeit 
        pills that contain fentanyl in the illicit drug market will 
        likely result in more opioid-dependent individuals, overdoses, 
        and deaths.
            (6) The DEA has identified two key challenges for using the 
        Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (21 
        U.S.C. 801 note) to prosecute individuals for violations 
        relating to fentanyl:
                    (A) The law requires that the substance have a 
                substantially similar chemical structure to a 
                controlled substance in order to be considered an 
                analogue, yet the threshold for ``substantially 
                similar'' has been cited by numerous courts as 
                difficult to apply.
                    (B) Each case requires additional investigation to 
                determine whether the substance in question was 
                ``intended for human consumption'' and can therefore be 
                considered an analogue.
            (7) Illicit fentanyl manufacturers are continuously 
        manipulating the chemical structures of the analogues in order 
        to stay ahead of researchers and law enforcement, thus making 
        prosecuting these crimes overly onerous. Furthermore, the speed 
        at which these alterations can be made outpace the current 
        authorities of the Department of Justice to schedule new 
        compounds and analogues under the Controlled Substances Act (21 
        U.S.C. 801 et seq.).
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the trafficking in fentanyl and other synthetic opioids 
        represents a public health emergency in the United States and 
        requires a comprehensive legislative response;
            (2) the United States Government should use all available 
        measures to reduce the availability of illicit fentanyl, its 
        chemical precursors, and the equipment by which fentanyl may be 
        milled into counterfeit prescription pills;
            (3) the United States Government should make grants 
        available for State and local medical examiners and coroners to 
        screen for fentanyl in suspected opioid overdose cases in 
        regions reporting increases in fentanyl seizures, fentanyl-
        related overdose fatalities, or unusually high spikes in heroin 
        or unspecified drug overdose fatalities;
            (4) State and local law enforcement should, if safe and 
        possible, prioritize and expedite testing of drug samples taken 
        from drug overdose scenes and share the data on fentanyl drug 
        seizures with local health departments, coroners, and medical 
        examiners;
            (5) grants made available to address the opioid epidemic 
        should be used to improve States' surveillance of fentanyl-
        related deaths and to expand access to naloxone for first 
        responders, law enforcement, and health care personnel given 
        that multiple doses of naloxone must be administered per 
        overdose event; and
            (6) the United States Government, including the Secretary 
        of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, and the Director of the Office of National Drug 
        Control Policy, should use the broad diplomatic and law 
        enforcement resources of the United States, in partnership with 
        the Governments of Mexico and China, to stop the trafficking of 
        illicit fentanyl into the United States.

striking ``substantially'' each place it appears.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Section 102(32)(A) of the Controlled 
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 82(32)(A)) shall not be construed to require 
that a substance satisfy more than one of the clauses listed in such 
section 102(32)(A) to meet the definition of a controlled substance 
analogue.

SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ANALOGUES.

    Section 203 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 813) is 
amended by striking ``shall, to the extent intended for human 
consumption, be treated, for the purposes of any Federal law as a

extent to which it should be reasonably known to the manufacturer,
