                                 A BILL


 
        To increase the number of operational aircraft carriers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In light of the increased array of complex threats 
        across the globe, the Navy is operating at maximum capacity, 
        increasing deployment lengths, and decreasing maintenance 
        periods in order to meet operational requirements.
            (2) Deployment lengths now frequently extend to 10 months, 
        which places considerable strain on personnel, equipment, and 
        platforms.
            (3) Upon return from deployment, units are often placed in 
        ``surge status'', requiring them to maintain high levels of 
        readiness and to quickly re-deploy if necessary.
            (4) An additional carrier strike group would give the 
        Secretary of Defense greater flexibility in deploying naval 
        forces as well as increase forward naval presence. It would 
        also improve the health and long-term service life of the 
        existing fleet by providing for longer maintenance and repair 
        time.
    (b) Increase in Number of Carriers.--Section 5062(b) of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended by striking ``11 operational aircraft 
carriers'' and inserting ``12 operational aircraft carriers''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (b) shall 
take effect on September 30, 2023.
                                 <all>
