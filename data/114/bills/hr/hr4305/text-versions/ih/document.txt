                                 A BILL


 
To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 to 
further enhance the assistance provided by the United States to Ukraine 
   to defend against further aggression by Russia and Russian-backed 
          separatists against Ukraine, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukrainian Warfighter Assistance 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Ukraine's border is 6,995 kilometers long, including 
        1,974 kilometers of controlled border with Russia, 195 
        kilometers of an administrative line with Crimea, and 409 
        kilometers of border in the east that is currently 
        uncontrolled.
            (2) Since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict 
        in 2014, 64 Ukrainian border guards have been killed and 
        another 391 have been wounded.
            (3) Implementation of the Minsk Agreement will require the 
        State Border Guard Service of Ukraine to reestablish border 
        checkpoints in currently uncontrolled territory and to monitor 
        the border to verify full implementation of the Agreement.
            (4) Ukraine has already ordered the development of 
        engineering and technical systems to strengthen the controlled 
        border between Ukraine and Russia, Ukranian maritime borders, 
        and areas adjacent to the uncontrolled territory and occupied 
        Crimea.
            (5) Russian unmanned aerial vehicles are being used for 
        correction of Russian-backed separatist artillery fire, and 
        Russian-backed separatists continue to compromise Ukrainian 
        tactical communication networks.
            (6) A Ukrainian early warning network is needed to warn of 
        any new aggression on the border.
            (7) Ukrainian anti-tank guided missiles require 
        modernization to increase soldier survivability.
            (8) Because future military operations in eastern Ukraine 
        will rely heavily on special operations forces, special 
        operations training is a high priority for the armed forces of 
        Ukraine.
            (9) Section 1250 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) rightfully called for 
        the United States to provide to Ukraine critical training and 
        equipment to enhance the capabilities of the military and other 
        security forces of Ukraine to defend against further aggression 
        from Russia and Russian-backed separatists.
            (10) The assistance provided to Ukraine under such section 
        must be enhanced even further to adapt to the current threats 
        facing Ukraine.

    Section 1250(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92) is amended--

        paragraph:
            ``(7) Electro-optical/infrared sensor and multi-mode radar 
        equipped early warning systems.'';
            (4) in paragraph (9), as so redesignated, by striking 
        ``(7)'' and inserting ``(8)''; and
            (5) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:

        the military and other security forces of the Government of 
        Ukraine.
            ``(12) Assistance to Ukraine to develop the ability to

            ``(13) Equipment and technical assistance provided directly

        developing a comprehensive and routine surveillance network.
            ``(14) Construction of a special forces training center and 
        assistance in developing a special forces training program.''.

that the Secretary of Defense, in cooperation with the Secretary of

new paragraph:

        Defense has prioritized, or is prioritizing, the security 
        assistance provided, or to be provided, to the Government of 
        Ukraine for the purposes of protecting and monitoring the 
        borders of Ukraine.''.
