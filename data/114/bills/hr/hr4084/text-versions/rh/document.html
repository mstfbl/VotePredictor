Capabilities Act''.

SEC. 2. NUCLEAR ENERGY.

    Section 951 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16271) is 
amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 951. NUCLEAR ENERGY.

    ``(a) Mission.--The Secretary shall conduct programs of civilian 
nuclear research, development, demonstration, and commercial 
application, including activities in this subtitle. Such programs shall 
take into consideration the following objectives:
            ``(1) Providing research infrastructure to promote 
        scientific progress and enable users from academia, the 
        National Laboratories, and the private sector to make 
        scientific discoveries relevant for nuclear, chemical, and 
        materials science engineering.
            ``(2) Maintaining National Laboratory and university 
        nuclear energy research and development programs, including 
        their infrastructure.
            ``(3) Providing the technical means to reduce the 
        likelihood of nuclear weapons proliferation and increasing 
        confidence margins for public safety of nuclear energy systems.
            ``(4) Reducing the environmental impact of nuclear energy 
        related activities.
            ``(5) Supporting technology transfer from the National 
        Laboratories to the private sector.
            ``(6) Enabling the private sector to partner with the 
        National Laboratories to demonstrate novel reactor concepts for 
        the purpose of resolving technical uncertainty associated with 
        the aforementioned objectives in this subsection.
    ``(b) Definitions.--In this subtitle:
            ``(1) Advanced fission reactor.--The term `advanced fission 
        reactor' means a nuclear fission reactor with significant 
        improvements over the most recent generation of nuclear 
        reactors, which may include inherent safety features, lower 
        waste yields, greater fuel utilization, superior reliability, 
        resistance to proliferation, and increased thermal efficiency.
            ``(2) Fast neutron.--The term `fast neutron' means a 
        neutron with kinetic energy above 100 kiloelectron volts.
            ``(3) National laboratory.--The term `National Laboratory' 
        has the meaning given that term in paragraph (3) of section 2, 
        except that with respect to subparagraphs (G), (H), and (N) of 
        such paragraph, for purposes of this subtitle the term includes 
        only the civilian activities thereof.
            ``(4) Neutron flux.--The term `neutron flux' means the 
        intensity of neutron radiation measured as a rate of flow of 
        neutrons applied over an area.
            ``(5) Neutron source.--The term `neutron source' means a 
        research machine that provides neutron irradiation services for 
        research on materials sciences and nuclear physics as well as 
        testing of advanced materials, nuclear fuels, and other related 
        components for reactor systems.
    ``(c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
nuclear energy, through fission or fusion, represents the highest 
energy density of any known attainable source and yields zero air 
emissions. This energy source is of national importance to scientific 
progress, national security, electricity generation, heat generation 
for industrial applications, and space exploration. Considering the 
inherent complexity and regulatory burden associated with this area of 
science, the Department should focus its civilian nuclear research and 
development activities towards programs that enable the private sector, 
National Laboratories, and universities to carry out such experiments 
as are necessary to promote scientific progress and enhance practical 
knowledge of nuclear engineering.''.
