take into consideration the following objectives:
            ``(1) Providing research infrastructure to promote 
        scientific progress and enable users from academia, the 
        National Laboratories, and the private sector to make 
        scientific discoveries relevant for nuclear, chemical, and 
        materials science engineering.
            ``(2) Maintaining National Laboratory and university 
        nuclear energy research and development programs, including 
        their infrastructure.
            ``(3) Providing the technical means to reduce the

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that nuclear energy, through 
fission or fusion, represents the highest energy density of any known 
attainable source and yields zero air emissions. This energy source is 
of national importance to scientific progress, national security, 
electricity generation, heat generation for industrial applications, 
and space exploration. Considering the inherent complexity and 
regulatory burden associated with this area of science, the Department 
should focus its civilian nuclear research and development activities 
towards programs that enable the private sector, National Laboratories, 
and universities to carry out such experiments as are necessary to 
promote scientific progress and enhance practical knowledge of nuclear 
engineering.

SEC. 5. HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION AND SUPPORTIVE RESEARCH.

    (a) Modeling and Simulation.--The Secretary shall carry out a 
program to enhance the Nation's capabilities to develop new reactor 
technologies through high-performance computation modeling and 
simulation techniques. This program shall coordinate with relevant 
Federal agencies through the National Strategic Computing Initiative 
created under Executive Order 13702 (July 29, 2015) while taking into 
account the following objectives:
            (1) Utilizing expertise from the private sector, 
        universities, and National Laboratories to develop 
        computational software and capabilities that prospective users 
        may access to accelerate research and development of advanced 
        fission reactor systems, nuclear fusion systems, and reactor 
        systems for space exploration.
            (2) Developing computational tools to simulate and predict 
        nuclear phenomena that may be validated through physical 
        experimentation.
            (3) Increasing the utility of the Department's research 
        infrastructure by coordinating with the Advanced Scientific 
        Computing Research program within the Office of Science.
            (4) Leveraging experience from the Energy Innovation Hub 
        for Modeling and Simulation.
            (5) Ensuring that new experimental and computational tools 
        are accessible to relevant research communities.
    (b) Supportive Research Activities.--The Secretary shall consider 
support for additional research activities to maximize the utility of 
its research facilities, including physical processes to simulate 
degradation of materials and behavior of fuel forms and for validation 
of computational tools.
