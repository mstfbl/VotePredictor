                                 A BILL


 
To provide a Federal charter to the Fab Foundation for the National Fab 
Lab Network, a national network of local digital fabrication facilities 
providing community access to advanced manufacturing tools for learning 
   skills, developing inventions, creating businesses, and producing 
                         personalized products.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Fab Lab Network Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are 
        critical to the economic and national security of the United 
        States.
            (2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require 
        a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to 
        tools required to advance these fields.
            (3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications 
        and computation provided individuals with the Internet and 
        personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will 
        allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.
            (4) These creations include communications devices, solar 
        powered housing, consumer products, and new kinds of machines 
        and tools for advanced manufacturing.
            (5) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology (CBA) has contributed significantly to 
        the advancement of these goals through its work in creating and 
        advancing digital fabrication facilities, or ``fab labs'' in 
        the United States and abroad.
            (6) MakerSpaces, TechShops, and other creative platforms 
        also facilitate access to digital fabrication capabilities.
            (7) CBA's fab labs provide a model for a new kind of 
        national laboratory that links local facilities for advanced 
        manufacturing to expand access and empower communities.
            (8) A coordinated national public-private partnership will 
        be the most effective way to accelerate the provision of this 
        infrastructure for learning skills, developing inventions, 
        creating businesses, and producing personalized products.
