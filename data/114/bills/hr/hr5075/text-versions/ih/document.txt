SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Airplane Impacts Mitigation Act of 
2016'' or ``AIM Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. STUDY OF HEALTH IMPACTS OF OVERFLIGHTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall enter into an agreement with an eligible 
institution of higher education to conduct a study of the health 
impacts of airplane flights on residents exposed to a range of noise 
and air pollution levels from such flights.
    (b) Scope of Study.--The study conducted under subsection (a) 
shall--
            (1) examine the health impacts of airplane flights on 
        residents, including asthma exacerbation, sleep disturbance, 
        stress, and elevated blood pressure;
            (2) focus on residents in not more than eight metropolitan 
        areas, including--
                    (A) Boston;

            (3) consider in particular the health impacts on residents 
        living partly or wholly within the land area underneath the 
        flight paths most frequently used by aircraft flying, including 
        during takeoff or landing, at an altitude lower than 10,000 
        feet; and
            (4) consider only those health impacts that manifest during 
        the physical implementation of the NextGen RNAV program on 
        flights departing from or arriving at an international airport 
        located in one of the metropolitan areas described in paragraph 
        (2).
    (c) Eligibility.--An institution of higher education is eligible to 
conduct the study if the institution--
            (1) has a school of public health that has participated in 
        the Federal Aviation Administration Center of Excellence for 
        Aircraft Noise and Aviation Emissions Mitigation (PARTNER);
            (2) has a Center for Environmental Health that receives 
        funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health 
        Sciences;
            (3) is located in one of the areas within the scope of the

        years after entering into an agreement under subsection (a), 
        the findings and conclusions of the study as well as any source 
        materials used; and
            (7) meets such other requirements as the Administrator may 
        determine to be necessary.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the Administrator
