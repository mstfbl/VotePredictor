                    (C) include standards to address the composition of

                            (i) adequately inform consumers of the

                (1).
    (c) Adoption of Voluntary Standard.--
            (1) In general.--Subsection (b)(1) shall not apply if the 
        Commission determines that--
                    (A) a voluntary standard pertaining to liquid 
                detergent packets manufactured or imported for use in 
                the United States protects children as described in 
                subsection (b)(1);
                    (B) such voluntary standard is or will be in effect 
                not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
                of this Act; and
                    (C) such voluntary standard is developed by ASTM 
                International Subcommittee F15.71 on Liquid Laundry 
                Packets, or such other entity as the Commission 
                considers a successor to ASTM International 
                Subcommittee F15.71.
            (2) Publication of determination.--If the Commission makes 
        a determination under paragraph (1), the Commission shall 
        publish such determination in the Federal Register.
            (3) Treatment of voluntary standard.--If the Commission 
        determines that a voluntary standard meets the conditions in 
        paragraph (1), such standard shall be treated as a consumer 
        product safety standard described in section 7(a) of the 
        Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)) beginning on 
        the date that is the later of--

                publication under paragraph (2) of such determination; 
                or
                    (B) the effective date specified in the voluntary

                    (A) Notice of revision.--If a voluntary standard is 
                treated as a consumer product safety standard under 
                paragraph (3) and such standard is revised by ASTM 
                International after the Commission makes a 
                determination under paragraph (1), ASTM International 
                shall notify the Commission of such revision not later 
                than 60 days after making such revision.
                    (B) Treatment of revisions.--A voluntary standard 
                with respect to which the Commission receives notice 
                under subparagraph (A) shall be treated as a consumer 
                product safety standard described in section 7(a) of 
                the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)), 
                promulgated in lieu of the prior version, effective 180 
                days after the date the Commission is notified of the 
                revision under subparagraph (A), unless not later than 
                90 days after receiving that notice the Commission 
                determines that the revised voluntary standard does not 
                meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(A), in which 
                case the Commission shall continue to enforce the prior 
                version.
    (d) Future Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission may, at any time after 
        promulgating a final rule under subsection (b)(1) or making a 
        determination under subsection (c)(1), promulgate such rules in 
        accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, as 
        the Commission considers appropriate to protect, to the maximum 
        degree practicable, children as described in subsection (a)(1).
            (2) Treatment as consumer product safety standard.--A rule 
        promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be treated as a consumer 
        product safety standard described in section 7(a) of the 
        Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)).
            (3) Inapplicability of certain requirements.--Section 9 of 
        the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) shall not 
        apply to a rulemaking under paragraph (1).
    (e) Report to Congress.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 4 years after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the

        Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives a report on risks posed by detergent packets to 
        young children and how the Commission is working to protect 
        such children from such risks.

                pediatric exposure to detergent packets, including the 
                number of exposure incidents, the means of exposure 
                (whether by ingestion, aspiration, or ocular contact), 
                the clinical effects of the exposures, and medical 
                outcomes.
                    (B) An assessment as to whether the rule 
                promulgated under subsection (b)(1) or the voluntary 
                standard adopted under subsection (c), as the case may 
                be, has been effective in protecting young children 
                from injury or illness caused by exposure to detergent 
                packets.
                    (C) Such recommendations for legislative or 
                administrative action as the Commission may have to 
                protect young children as described in subparagraph 
                (B).
            (3) Publication.--The Commission shall make the report
