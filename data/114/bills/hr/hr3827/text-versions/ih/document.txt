    Paragraph (11) of section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(11)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``(11) Leasing of units owned by pha.--If'' 
        and inserting the following:
            ``(11) Leasing of units owned by pha.--
                    ``(A) Inspections and rent determinations.--If''; 
                and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(B) Units owned by pha.--For purposes of this 
                subsection, the term `owned by a public housing agency' 
                means, with respect to a dwelling unit, that the 
                dwelling unit is in a project that is owned by such 
                agency, by an entity wholly controlled by such agency, 
                or by a limited liability company or limited 
                partnership in which such agency (or an entity wholly 
                controlled by such agency) holds a controlling interest 
                in the managing member or general partner. A dwelling 
                unit shall not be deemed to be owned by a public 
                housing agency for purposes of this subsection because 
                the agency holds a fee interest as ground lessor in the 
                property on which the unit is situated, holds a 
                security interest under a mortgage or deed of trust on 
                the unit, or holds a non-controlling interest in an 
                entity which owns the unit or in the managing member or 
                general partner of an entity which owns the unit.''.
