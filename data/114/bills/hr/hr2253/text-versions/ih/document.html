                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to extend the application 
 of the Medicare payment rate floor to primary care services furnished 
 under Medicaid and to apply the rate floor to additional providers of 
                         primary care services.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Primary Care for 
Women & Children Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Medicaid plays a key role in providing coverage for 
        millions of working families.
            (2) Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, 
        children, individuals with disabilities, and other low-income 
        individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be 
        uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.
            (3) In 2014, the Medicaid program covered 69,000,000 
        individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will 
        continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act 
        significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured 
        adults.
            (4) If all States expand their Medicaid programs, an 
        estimated 7,000,000 women ages 18 to 64 would gain coverage 
        under Medicaid.
            (5) In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid 
        pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary 
        care services.
            (6) Congress has recognized that low provider participation 
        in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this 
        problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for 
        certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare 
        payment rates for 2013 and 2014.
            (7) As more Americans become insured and empowered 
        participants in their own health care, demand for primary care 
        services is expected to increase over the next few years.
            (8) According to a study published earlier this year in the 
        New England Journal of Medicine, higher Medicaid payment rates 
        have significantly increased appointment availability for 
        Medicaid enrollees.
            (9) Six in 10 women ages 18 to 44 (58 percent) report they 
        see an obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physician on a 
        regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN 
        physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. 
        Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, 
        it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN 
        physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in 
        Medicaid.
            (10) Nurse practitioners and other health professionals 
        deliver many primary care services. Applying Medicare's rates 
        for nurse practitioners and other health professionals 
        encourages greater participation in Medicaid, thereby 
        increasing access to primary care, particularly in underserved 
        areas.
            (11) The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures 
        providers have the financial capability to serve their 
        patients' primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse 
        practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, 
        and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings 
        increases access to critical health care services for women and 
        children nationwide.

SEC. 3. RENEWAL OF APPLICATION OF MEDICARE PAYMENT RATE FLOOR TO 
              PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FURNISHED UNDER MEDICAID AND 
              INCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS.

    (a) Renewal of Payment Floor; Additional Providers.--
            (1) In general.--Section 1902(a)(13) of the Social Security 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)) is amended by striking 
        subparagraph (C) and inserting the following:
                    ``(C) payment for primary care services (as defined 
                in subsection (jj)) at a rate that is not less than 100 
                percent of the payment rate that applies to such 
                services and physician under part B of title XVIII (or, 
                if greater, the payment rate that would be applicable 
                under such part if the conversion factor under section 
                1848(d) for the year involved were the conversion 
                factor under such section for 2009), and that is not 
                less than the rate that would otherwise apply to such 
                services under this title if the rate were determined 
                without regard to this subparagraph, and that are--
                            ``(i) furnished in 2013 and 2014, by a
