                under the demonstration program may apply to the 
                Secretary for a waiver under subsection (h) in order to 
                modify cost-sharing for items and services furnished 
                through such PCN under the demonstration program.
    ``(c) Beneficiary Assignment.--

                Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to such PCN for 
                such year. Such assignment shall be based on 
                utilization of primary care services furnished under 
                this title by a provider of services or supplier 
                participating in the PCN involved.

                establish a pilot program under which such PCNs have a 
                process through which Medicare fee-for-service 
                beneficiaries may select a PCN. Such selection by the 
                beneficiary shall be treated for purposes of this 
                section as the assignment of the beneficiary to the PCN 
                and shall supercede any other assignment by the 
                Secretary under subparagraph (A) with respect to such 
                beneficiary.

        to a PCN, the Secretary shall allow the PCN to contact the 
        beneficiary to designate a primary care physician participating 
        in the PCN who shall be accountable for the coordination of the 
        medical care of the beneficiary. The Secretary shall also allow 
        the PCN to communicate with other individuals entitled to 
        benefits under part A or enrolled under part B in the region 
        served by the PCN regarding the opportunity to participate in

        the assignment of an individual to a primary care physician 
        participating in the PCN in the absence of such designation by 
        the individual in a manner that promotes patient engagement and 
        stability in assignment and that takes into account primary 
        care visits by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician 
        assistants.
            ``(3) Payments with respect to population.--Except in 
        circumstances specified by the Secretary, during the period for 
        which a Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary is a participating

                demonstration project from a provider of services or 
                supplier not participating in or otherwise entering

                        such a provider may establish a contractual 
                        relationship with a PCN for reimbursement,

                            ``(ii) Subsequent years.--The Secretary may 
                        establish a generally applicable savings 
                        benchmark for all PCNs in the demonstration 
                        project for any year subsequent to the third 
                        year of the demonstration project, provided 
                        that in establishing such benchmark the 
                        Secretary shall not recapture the savings 
                        retained by PCNs in prior years in any manner.
            ``(2) Payments to pcns.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For each month of each year a 
                PCN participates in the demonstration project, the 
                Secretary shall pay each PCN a prospective, monthly 
                payment equal to one-twelfth of the PCN specific 
                population health budget under paragraph (1)(B) 
                calculated for such PCN for such year. In carrying out 
                the previous sentence, any payment so made shall be 
                made to the PCN and not to a provider of services or 
                supplier participating in such PCN.
                    ``(B) Special circumstances.--The Secretary shall 
                identify special circumstances in which payment may be 
                made under parts A and B with respect to a 
                participating beneficiary other than under this 
                section. The Secretary shall ensure that each PCN 
                establishes a mechanism for reimbursement and budget 
                adjustment in the case of such special circumstances 
                attributable to participating beneficiaries and a 
                method for adjusting the PCN specific prospective 
                population health budgets to the PCNs involved in such 
                cases to account for payments made under parts A and B 
                in such circumstances for such participating 
                beneficiaries to providers of services and suppliers 
                that are not participating in (or contracting with) the 
                PCN involved.
    ``(e) Data Sharing.--The Secretary shall promptly provide necessary 
data on a regular basis to a PCN, including each claim for items and 
services for which payment may be made under parts A, B, and D 
associated with participating beneficiaries of such PCN, to enable the 
coordination of care for participating beneficiaries with respect to 
such PCN.
    ``(f) Quality Reports.--The Secretary shall establish performance 
standards (and a method to assess the performance of PCNs with respect 
to such quality standards) to assess the quality of care furnished by 
PCNs. Such assessment shall initially be based on the quality measures 
used for organizations that have entered into shared savings agreements 
pursuant to sections 1115A and 1899. The Secretary shall seek to 
improve the quality of care furnished by PCNs over time by specifying 
higher standards, new measures, or both for purposes of assessing such 
quality of care.
    ``(g) Coordination.--The Secretary may, in such manner and 
according to such methods as specified by the Secretary, coordinate the 
activities of PCNs with respect to covered part D drugs in order to 
increase the quality and availability of health care items or services 
to participating beneficiaries and may elect to contract with PCNs to 
provide prescription drug coverage.
    ``(h) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary shall waive such 
requirements of sections 1128A and 1128B of this title as may be 
necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Such waivers 
shall include, without limitation, a waiver of prohibition on 
beneficiary inducements in the form of co-pay waivers, medical 
transportation, provision of tele-health and medical monitoring 
equipment for home use, contracts with providers of services and 
suppliers participating in the PCN, and waivers allowing the provision 
of other supplies and services that permit the efficient delivery of 
care in home, post-acute, and alternative settings. Any waivers 
established pursuant to section 1899(f) shall also apply to the 
demonstration project.
    ``(i) Administration.--Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, 
shall not apply to the demonstration project.
    ``(j) State Insurance Laws; Preemption.--A PCN shall not be 
required to be licensed as a health insurance company or health 
maintenance organization under the laws of any State. Any State law 
that would undermine the purpose of this section is preempted.
    ``(k) Reports to Congress.--The Secretary shall for each year of 
the demonstration project submit to Congress a report on the status and 
results of the demonstration project.
    ``(l) Expansion of Project.--The Secretary may, through rulemaking, 
expand (including implementation on a nationwide basis) the duration 
and the scope of the demonstration project, to the extent determined 
appropriate by the Secretary, if--
            ``(1) the Secretary determines that such expansion is 
        expected to--
                    ``(A) reduce spending under this title without 
                reducing the quality of care; or
                    ``(B) improve the quality of patient care without 
                increasing spending;
            ``(2) the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & 
        Medicaid Services certifies that such expansion would reduce 
        (or would not result in any increase in) net program spending 
        under this title; and
            ``(3) the Secretary determines that such expansion would 
        not deny or limit the coverage or provision of benefits under 
        the applicable title for applicable individuals.
    ``(m) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) The term `hospital' means a subsection (d) hospital 
        (as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B)).
            ``(2) The term `Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary' has 
        the meaning given such term in section 1899(h)(3).
            ``(3) The term `participating beneficiary' means, with 
        respect to a PCN, a Medicare fee-for-service beneficiary who 
        has been assigned under subsection (c) to such PCN.''.
