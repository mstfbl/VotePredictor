                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require certain 
 companies to disclose information describing any measures the company 
has taken to identify and address conditions of forced labor, slavery, 
   human trafficking, and the worst forms of child labor within the 
                        company's supply chains.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Business Supply Chain Transparency 
on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods 
        from 74 countries around the world made by forced labor and 
        child labor.
            (2) The United States is the world's largest importer, and 
        in the 21st century, investors, consumers, and broader civil 
        society increasingly demand information about the human rights 
        impact of products in the United States market.
            (3) Courts have ruled that consumers do not have standing 
        to bring a civil action in United States courts for enforcement 
        of a provision in the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 
        prohibiting importation of goods made with forced labor or 
        convict labor, and furthermore, the provision has a broad 
        exception for goods that cannot be produced in the United 
        States in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of American 
        consumers from tainted goods, consequently, there are fewer 
        than 40 enforcement actions on record in the past 80 years.
            (4) Mechanisms under Federal law to prevent and punish 
        perpetrators of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and 
        the worst forms of child labor in the stream of commerce suffer 
        from problems of limited scope, broad expectations, and lack of 
        available information about goods that are produced along 
        supply chains tainted by these crimes and imported by the 
        United States.
            (5) The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act 
        of 2003 (Public Law 108-193) together with the Trafficking 
        Victims Protection Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-164) provide for 
        the termination of Federal contracts where a Federal contractor 
        or subcontractor engages in severe forms of trafficking in 
        persons or has procured a commercial sex act during the period 
        of time that the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement is 
        in effect, or uses forced labor in the performance of the 
        grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. The Trafficking 
        Victims Protection Act of 2005 also provides United States 
        courts with criminal jurisdiction abroad over Federal 
        employees, contractors, or subcontractors who participate in 
        severe forms of trafficking in persons or forced labor.
            (6) Executive Order 13126, Prohibition of Acquisition of 
        Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor, 
        Executive Order 13627, Strengthening Protections Against 
        Trafficking In Persons In Federal Contracts, and title XVII of 
        the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 
        (Public Law 112-239) have prohibited Federal contractors, 
        subcontractors, and their employees from engaging in the 
        following trafficking-related activities: charging labor 
        recruitment fees; confiscating passports and other identity 
        documents of workers; and using fraudulent recruitment 
        practices, including failing to disclose basic information or 
        making material misrepresentations about the terms and 
        conditions of employment. Such Executive order and Acts also 
        require Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their 
        employees to maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan that 
        includes, among other elements, a complaint mechanism and 
        procedures to prevent subcontractors at any tier in the supply 
        chain from engaging in trafficking in persons.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst 
        forms of child labor are among the most egregious forms of 
        abuse that humans commit against each other, for the sake of 
        commercial profit;
            (2) the legislative and regulatory framework to prevent 
        goods produced by forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and 
        the worst forms of child labor from passing into the stream of 
        commerce in the United States is gravely inadequate;
            (3) legislation is necessary to provide consumers 
        information on products that are free of child labor, forced 
        labor, slavery, and human trafficking; and
            (4) through publicly available disclosures, businesses and 
        consumers can avoid inadvertently promoting or sanctioning 
        these crimes through production and purchase of raw materials, 
        goods and finished products that have been tainted in the 
        supply chains.

SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATING TO EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE USE 
              OF FORCED LABOR, SLAVERY, TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, OR THE 
              WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR.

    Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) 
is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(s) Disclosures Relating to Efforts To Combat the Use of Forced 
Labor, Slavery, Trafficking in Persons, or the Worst Forms of Child 
Labor.--
            ``(1) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of the Business Supply Chain Transparency on 
        Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015, the Commission, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State, shall promulgate 
        regulations to require that any covered issuer required to file 
        reports with the Commission under this section to include 
        annually in such reports, a disclosure whether the covered 
        issuer has taken any measures during the year for which such 
        reporting is required to identify and address conditions of 
        forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms 
        of child labor within the covered issuer's supply chain, and a 
        description of such measures taken. Such disclosure shall 
        include, under the heading `Policies to Address Forced Labor, 
        Slavery, Human Trafficking, and the Worst Forms of Child 
        Labor', information describing to what extent, if any, the 
        covered issuer conducts any of the following activities:
                    ``(A) Whether the covered issuer maintains a policy 
                to identify and eliminate the risks of forced labor, 
                slavery, human trafficking, and the worst forms of 
                child labor within the covered issuer's supply chain 
                (such disclosure to include the text of the policy or 
                substantive description of the elements of the policy), 
                and actions the covered issuer has taken pursuant to or 
                in the absence of such policy.

                product supply chain. If such efforts have been made,

                        associations, or workers and if so, the 
                        disclosure shall describe the entities 
                        consulted and specify the method of such
