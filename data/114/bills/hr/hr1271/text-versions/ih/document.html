To provide for systemic research, treatment, prevention, awareness, and 
 dissemination of information with respect to sports-related and other 
                              concussions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Concussion Awareness and Education 
Act of 2015''.

    The table of contents of this Act is as follows:

Sec. 1. Short title.
Sec. 2. Table of contents.

Sec. 4. Surveillance of sports-related concussions.
Sec. 5. Research.
Sec. 6. Dissemination of information.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) There is currently no comprehensive system for 
        acquiring accurate data on the incidence of sports- and 
        recreation-related concussions across youth age groups and 
        sports.
            (2) Overall, according to a report entitled ``Sports-
        Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing 
        the Culture'', issued by the National Academies in 2013, each 
        year in the United States, there are approximately 1.6 to 3.8 
        million sports- and recreation-related traumatic brain 
        injuries, including concussions and other head injuries. These 
        figures are based on conservative estimates.
            (3) Between 2001 and 2009, the reported number of our youth 
        ages 21 and under treated in an emergency department for 
        concussion and other non-fatal sports and recreation-related 
        traumatic brain injuries increased from 150,000 to 250,000.
            (4) Over the same time period between 2001 and 2009, the 
        rate of emergency room visits for concussive injuries increased 
        by 57 percent.
            (5) Yet, according to the National Academies there 
        currently is--
                    (A) a lack of data to accurately estimate the 
                incidence of sports-related concussions across a 
                variety of sports and for youth across the pediatric 
                age spectrum; and
                    (B) no comprehensive system for acquiring accurate 
                data on the incidence of sports- and recreation-related 
                concussions across all youth age groups and sports.
            (6) Currently, there are significant information gaps in 
        the proper protocol for diagnosis and treatment of sports-
        related concussions and more research desperately is needed.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to increase awareness and knowledge about concussions 
        through development of, implementation of, and evaluation of 
        the effectiveness of, large-scale collaborative efforts and 
        research by entities including, but not limited to, national 
        sports associations, State high school associations, trainers' 
        associations, appropriate Federal entities, and other 
        stakeholders such as parents, coaches, and students; and
            (2) to change the culture (including social norms, 
        attitudes, and behaviors) surrounding concussions among 
        elementary school youth and their parents, coaches, sports 
        officials, educators, trainers, and health care professionals, 
        taking into account demographic variations across population 
        groups, where appropriate.

SEC. 4. SURVEILLANCE OF SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS.

    Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting 
after section 317T of such Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-22) the following:
