    (b) GAO Report.--
            (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
        shall conduct a study on the effectiveness of priority review 
        vouchers under section 565A of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
        Cosmetic Act, as added by subsection (a), in providing 
        incentives for the development of material threat medical 
        countermeasure applications under such section 565A. In 
        conducting such study, the Comptroller General shall examine 
        the following:
                    (A) The impact of such priority review on the 
                development of material threat medical countermeasures 
                and the impact of such investment, as applicable, on 
                the development of such countermeasures.
                    (B) How the drugs for which such priority review 
                vouchers were awarded--
                            (i) addressed identified medical 
                        countermeasure needs; and
                            (ii) impacted United States preparedness 
                        against chemical, biological, radiological, and 
                        nuclear threats, including both identified 
                        threats and naturally occurring threats.
                    (C) How many material threat medical 
                countermeasures were licensed or approved, or otherwise 
                significantly advanced in clinical development, in the 
                15 years following the enactment of such section 565A 
                compared to the 15 years prior to the enactment of such 
                section, including a comparative analysis of Federal 
                advanced development and procurement dollars available 
                in the 15 years following such enactment compared to 
                the prior 15 years.
                    (D) How material threat medical countermeasures 
                developed after the date of enactment of this Act 
                impact--
                            (i) the supply of products in the strategic 
                        national stockpile under section 319F-2 of the 
                        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6b); 
                        and
                            (ii) national preparedness.
                    (E) How the Federal Government supported sponsors 
                of material threat medical countermeasures during the 
                research, development, application review, and 
                production of such drugs, including the use of 
                government research, provision of resources through 
                contracts or grants, and use of federally funded 
                research facilities.
                    (F) An analysis of the drugs for which such 
                priority review vouchers were used, which shall

                                    (I) if there was a currently 
                                marketed therapy approved to prevent or 
                                treat the same indication in the same 
                                patient population at the time the 
                                application was submitted to the Food 
                                and Drug Administration; and
                                    (II) if the drug provided a

                        voucher if transferred or sold prior to 
                        redemption; and
                            (iv) the length of time between the date on 
                        which a priority review voucher was awarded and 
                        the date on which it was used.
                    (G) With respect to the priority review voucher 
                program under such section 565A--
                            (i) how many priority review vouchers were 
                        awarded under such section 565A and how many of 
                        such awarded vouchers were redeemed for 
                        priority review of a drug application in the 15 
                        years following the date of enactment of such 
                        section;
                            (ii) the resources associated with the Food 
                        and Drug Administration implementation of such 
                        section 565A and review of applications for 
                        which a voucher awarded under such section 565A 
                        is redeemed for priority review and if 
                        implementation of such section 565A prohibited 
                        the Food and Drug Administration from meeting 
                        drug application review goals;

                        appropriate Federal funding for advanced 
                        development and research would necessitate the 
                        priority review voucher program for medical 
                        countermeasures;
                            (iv) the degree to which this incentive 
                        program impacts other priority review voucher 
                        programs; and
                            (v) the degree to which guaranteed Federal 
                        funding for advanced development and research 
                        is a greater incentive for new investment in 
                        research and the development of medical 
                        countermeasures than the uncertain values of 
                        vouchers.
