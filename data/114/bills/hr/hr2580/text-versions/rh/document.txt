                Secretary shall set the fixed loss amount for high cost 
                outlier payments such that the estimated aggregate 
                amount of high cost outlier payments made for standard 
                Federal payment rate discharges for fiscal years

                system.
                    ``(D) No effect on site neutral high cost outlier

                payment rates determined under subparagraph 
                (B)(iii)(II) of such paragraph.''.
