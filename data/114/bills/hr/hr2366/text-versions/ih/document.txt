SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Patients with emergency medical conditions depend upon 
        field emergency medical services (referred to in this section 
        as ``EMS'') for essential life-saving or unscheduled medical 
        care. All people in the United States should have access to and 
        receive high-quality emergency medical care as part of a 
        coordinated EMS system.
            (2) The Institute of Medicine, in its 2006 report 
        ``Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads'', outlined its 
        vision of a 21st century emergency care system that is 
        integrated, regionalized, accountable, and prepared for both 
        routine emergency medical care and public health emergencies. 
        Such a modernized system would be characterized by a highly 
        trained and capable field EMS practitioner workforce that 
        delivers high-quality, evidence-based, innovative, value-based, 
        and patient-centered emergency care in the field and across the 
        emergency care continuum.
            (3) In such 2006 report, the Institute of Medicine also 
        outlined systemic problems plaguing field EMS that impede 
        achievement of a 21st century emergency care system, including 
        insufficient coordination, disparate response times, uncertain 
        quality of care, lack of readiness for disasters, divided 
        professional identity of field EMS practitioners, and a limited 
        evidence base for the emergency medical care provided in the 
        field.
            (4) To modernize the field EMS system, the Institute of 
        Medicine recommended that advancements be made in several 
        priority areas, including readiness, innovation, preparedness, 
        education and workforce development, safety, financing, 
        quality, standards, and research. The Institutes of Medicine 
        also recommended recognition of a lead programmatic Federal 
        agency for emergency medical services within the Department of 
        Health and Human Services to provide a more streamlined, cost-
        efficient, and comprehensive approach for field EMS, and a 
        focal point for practitioners and agencies to interface with 
        the Federal Government.
            (5) Under an amendment made by the Pandemic and All-Hazards 
        Preparedness Act (Public Law 109-417), the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services is already established as the lead of all 
        Federal public health and medical response for public health 
        emergencies and incidents. Preparedness and capability to 
        deliver routine emergency medical care is a prerequisite for 
        preparedness and capability to respond to public health 
        emergencies and incidents.
            (6) In 2007, the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 
        HSPD-21 called for the establishment within the Department of 
        Health and Human Services of an Office for Emergency Medical 
        Care to lead an enterprise to promote and fund research in 
        emergency medicine and trauma care; promote regional 
        partnerships and more effective emergency medical systems in 
        order to enhance appropriate triage, distribution, and care of 
        routine community patients; and promote local, regional, and 
        State emergency medical systems' preparedness for and response 
        to public health events. Under the Directive, the Office would 
        address the full spectrum of issues that have an impact on care 
        in hospital emergency departments, including the entire 
        continuum of patient care from prehospital to disposition from 
        emergency or trauma care.
            (7) Properly functioning EMS systems encompass fully mobile 
        resources that are able to address patient needs 24 hours per 
        day, 7 days per week, 365 days a year. Field EMS serves as an 
        essential health care safety net by providing emergency, 
        urgent, and mobile medical care throughout the health care 
        continuum, including medical and trauma care provided in the 
        field, hospital, rehabilitation, and other settings. Ensuring 
        high-quality and cost-effective emergency medical services 
        systems requires readiness, preparedness, medical oversight, 
        and innovation throughout the continuum of emergency medical 
        care through Federal, State, and local multi-jurisdictional 
        collaboration and sufficient resources for EMS agencies and 
        practitioners.
            (8) Field EMS is the delivery of health care, not simply a 
        transportation benefit having evolved from a patient transport 
        model to a health care service delivery model that provides a 
        variety of targeted medical services to meet the specific needs 
        of their communities. This includes the development of 
        community paramedicine as a health care service provided by 
        field EMS agencies and mobile integrated health care as a 
        health care service provided collaboratively by a group of 
        health care providers in a community, including local field EMS 
        agencies. These new delivery models are filling gaps in patient 
        care identified by a community's health care providers, 
        including preventing recurrent medical episodes through 
        reliable post-discharge follow up and chronic disease 
        management. Facilitating reimbursement for such services, 
        including under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), is necessary to 
        the continued development and sustainability of such services.
            (9) Field EMS is uniquely positioned to support the 
        transformation of health care to a value and outcomes based 
        model to improve the patient experience and the health of 
        populations, and to reduce the per capita cost of health care. 
        Field EMS provides highly reliable patient assessment and 
        intervention at any hour of any day in response to urgent or 
        unscheduled episodes of illness or injury and effectively 
        navigates patients to ensure they receive the right care, in 
        the right place, and at the right time. Field EMS helps contain 
        health care costs by navigating the patient down a cost-
        effective pathway that is evidence-based.
            (10) Coordinated and high-quality field EMS is essential to 
        the Nation's security. Field EMS is an essential public service 
        provided by governmental and nongovernmental agencies and 
        practitioners every day and during catastrophic incidents. To 
        ensure disaster and all-hazards preparedness for field EMS 
        operations as part of the Nation's comprehensive disaster 
        preparedness, Federal funding for preparedness activities, 
        including catastrophic training and exercises, must be provided 
        to governmental and nongovernmental field EMS agencies to 
        ensure a greater capability within each of these areas.
            (11) The essential role of field EMS in disaster 
        preparedness and response must be incorporated into the 
        national preparedness and response strategy and implementation 
        as provided and overseen by the Department of Homeland Security 
        and the Department of Health and Human Services, pursuant to 
        their respective jurisdictions. Field EMS agencies must be 
        capable of meeting the routine emergency care needs of patients 
        to be capable of meeting the extraordinary medical needs during 
        a catastrophic event.

    (b) Field EMS Alternative Delivery Program.--Section 1834(l) of the

end the following new paragraph:
            ``(16) Field ems alternative delivery program.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the 
                date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary

                the demonstration projects conducted under section

                ascertains that an innovative payment model has been 
                sufficiently demonstrated through the private sector or 
                through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
                under section 1115A and does not need to be evaluated 
                under subparagraph (G), the Secretary may establish

                authorizing the Secretary to require participation in 
                any innovative payment model under the Program.
