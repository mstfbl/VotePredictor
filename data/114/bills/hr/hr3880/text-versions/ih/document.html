                                 A BILL


 
   To prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from exceeding its 
statutory authority in ways that were not contemplated by the Congress.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Environmental Protection Agency has exceeded its 
        statutory authority by promulgating regulations that were not 
        contemplated by Congress in the authorizing language of the 
        statutes enacted by Congress;
            (2) the Environmental Protection Agency was correct not to 
        classify greenhouse gases as pollutants prior to 2009;
            (3) no Federal agency has the authority to regulate 
        greenhouse gases under current law; and
            (4) no attempt to regulate greenhouse gases should be 
        undertaken without further Congressional action.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF FEDERAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY TO EXCLUDE 
              GREENHOUSE GASES FROM REGULATION UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

    (a) Repeal of Federal Climate Change Regulation.--
            (1) Greenhouse gas regulation under clean air act.--Section 
        302(g) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7602(g)) is amended--
                    (A) by striking ``(g) The term'' and inserting the 
                following:
    ``(g) Air Pollutant.--
            ``(1) In general.--The term''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Exclusion.--The term `air pollutant' does not include 
        carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, 
        hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfur 
        hexafluoride.''.
            (2) No regulation of climate change.--Notwithstanding any 
        other provision of law, nothing in any of the following Acts or 
        any other law authorizes or requires the regulation of climate 
        change or global warming:
                    (A) The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).
                    (B) The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
                U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).
                    (C) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
                (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
                    (D) The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
                1531 et seq.).
                    (E) The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et 
                seq.).
    (b) Effect on Proposed Rules of the EPA.--In accordance with this 
section, the following proposed or contemplated rules (or any similar 
or successor rules) of the Environmental Protection Agency shall be 
void and have no force or effect:
            (1) The proposed rule entitled ``Standards of Performance 
        for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New Stationary Sources: 
        Electric Utility Generating Units'' (published at 79 Fed. Reg. 
        1430 (January 8, 2014)).
            (2) The proposed rule entitled ``Carbon Pollution Emission 
        Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility 
        Generating Units'' (published at 79 Fed. Reg. 34829 (June 18, 
        2014)).
            (3) Any other contemplated or proposed rules proposed to be 
        issued pursuant to the purported authority described in 
        subsection (a)(2).

SEC. 4. JOBS ANALYSIS FOR ALL EPA REGULATIONS.

    (a) In General.--Before proposing or finalizing any regulation, 
rule, or policy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency shall provide an analysis of the regulation, rule, or policy and 
describe the direct and indirect net and gross impact of the 
regulation, rule, or policy on employment in the United States.
    (b) Limitation.--No regulation, rule, or policy described in 
subsection (a) shall take effect if the regulation, rule, or policy has 
a negative impact on employment in the United States unless the 
regulation, rule, or policy is approved by Congress and signed by the 
President.
