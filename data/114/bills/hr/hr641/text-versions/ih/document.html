                        income over the amount of charitable 
                        contributions allowable under subparagraph (A).
                            ``(ii) Carryover.--If the aggregate amount 
                        of contributions described in clause (i) 
                        exceeds the limitation of clause (i), such

                        of this subparagraph, the term `Native 
                        Corporation' has the meaning given such term by

                        Settlement Act.''.

            (3) Valid existing rights preserved.--Nothing in this 
        subsection (or any amendment made by this subsection) shall be 
        construed to modify the existing property rights validly 
        conveyed to Native Corporations (within the meaning of section 
        3(m) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act) under such 
        Act.
