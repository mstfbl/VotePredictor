Development Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Interstate Route 11 would significantly enhance for the 
        Western United States--
                    (A) commerce;
                    (B) tourism;
                    (C) international trade;
                    (D) economic vitality; and
                    (E) competitiveness on the global stage;
            (2) Interstate Route 11 would connect communities and 
        economic systems in the States of Arizona and Nevada, 
        including--
                    (A) the 2 largest cities in the United States 
                without an Interstate connection;
                    (B) major trade hubs;
                    (C) existing and future domestic and international 
                deep-water ports; and
                    (D) transcontinental roadways and railroad 
                corridors;
            (3) Interstate Route 11 would improve safety and travel 
        time in north-south corridors of the Western United States; and
            (4) the establishment of Interstate Route 11 from the State 
        of Arizona-Mexico border through the State of Nevada and, 
        ultimately integrating into existing high priority corridors of 
        the National Highway System leading to the Canadian border, 
        would enhance the economic vitality of the Western United 
        States.
