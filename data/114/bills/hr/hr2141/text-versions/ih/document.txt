                                 A BILL


 
  To require consultation with Congress, insurers, and consumers with 
 respect to domestic insurance and international insurance standards, 
          regulations, or frameworks, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``International Insurance Standards 
Transparency and Policyholder Protection Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. CONSULTATION CONCERNING NEGOTIATIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
              INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The State-based system for insurance regulation in the 
        United States has served American consumers well for more than 
        150 years.
            (2) Protecting policyholders by guaranteeing an insurer's 
        ability to pay claims has been the hallmark of the successful 
        U.S. system and should be the paramount objective of domestic 
        prudential regulation and emerging international standards.
            (3) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
        Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) reaffirmed the State-based 
        insurance regulatory system, while giving the Board of 
        Governors of the Federal Reserve System authority to regulate 
        certain non-bank entities on a consolidated basis, including 
        insurers that have been designated systemically important 
        financial institutions or that include an insured depository 
        institution and are regulated by the States at the insurance 
        entity level.
            (4) United States regulators participating in discussions 
        or negotiations regarding international insurance regulatory 
        frameworks should support standards designed solely for the 
        protection of policyholders.
            (5) The Federal Insurance Office should seek advice and 
        recommendations from a diverse group of outside experts in 
        performing the duties and authorities of the Office to ensure 
        policy holders are protected.
    (b) Negotiating Objectives for International Insurance Regulatory 
Frameworks.--The negotiating objectives of the United States regarding 
international insurance regulatory frameworks are as follows:
            (1) To seek standards, requirements, and rules focused 
        solely on protection of policy holders, as reflected in the 
        United States solvency regime.
            (2) To promote a principles-based approach to insurance 
        supervision, in which capital adequacy is assessed using risk-
        based capital requirements combined with qualitative risk 
        assessment and management tools on a legal entity basis, rather 
        than a quantitative global capital standard for insurance 
        groups.
            (3) To seek the most efficient and least disruptive 
        approaches to enhancing regulatory assessment of the capital 
        adequacy of insurance groups, including tools that are already 
        in place, such as supervisory colleges, as well as the 
        evaluation of the capitalization of an insurance group using 
        the existing internal model of the group, where appropriate, 
        which captures the risks associated with each unique line of 
        business and geographic mix of the group.
            (4) To negotiate an international insurance regulatory 
        framework that recognizes United States prudential measures as 
        equivalent to foreign measures.
    (c) Prohibitions and Focus on Policy Holder Protection.--With 
respect to negotiations related to any international insurance 
regulatory framework:
            (1) Inappropriate bank capital standards.--United States 
        representatives shall not agree to, accept, or establish, and 
        shall use their voice and vote to oppose, any international 
        standard that applies to--
                    (A) insurers, capital standards, and rules designed 
                for banks; or
                    (B) any insurer that has not been designated a 
                systemically important financial institution under 
                United States law or a global systemically important 
                insurer by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 
                capital standards and rules designed for systemically 
                important bank or non-bank financial institutions.
            (2) Focus on policyholder protection.--
                    (A) In general.--United States representatives 
                shall not agree to, accept, or establish, and shall use 
                their voice and vote to oppose, any capital standard or 
                rule applicable to United States insurance entities or 
                groups unless that standard is designed solely to help 
                ensure that sufficient funds are available to pay 
                claims to an insurer's policyholders in the event of 
                the liquidation of that entity.
                    (B) Enhanced capital standards.--The limitation 
                under subparagraph (A) does not apply to enhanced 
                capital standards applicable to insurance entities or 
                groups designated under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank 
                Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 
                U.S.C. 5323).
    (d) Notice and Consultation.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to any international 
        insurance regulatory framework, the President shall--
                    (A) not less than 90 days before the United States

                the covered congressional committees written notice of

                objectives of such negotiations, including whether and 
                how such objectives achieve the objectives set forth in 
                subsection (b) and are consistent with the prohibitions 
                under subsection (c) and with existing Federal and 
                State laws or regulations or policy related to 
                prudential regulation of insurance;
                    (B) during the negotiations of such a regulatory 
                framework, including prior to significant decisions 
                points in the negotiations and prior to development of 
                interim drafts, and before agreeing to, accepting, or 
                establishing such framework, consult with the covered 
                congressional committees and the Federal Advisory

                consistent with the prohibitions under subsection (c) 
                and with existing Federal and State laws or regulations

            (2) be construed to alter, amend, or limit any provision of
