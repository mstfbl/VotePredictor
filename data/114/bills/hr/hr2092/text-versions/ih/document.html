                operator ceases to provide the service to the 
                educational agency or institution, unless the 
                information is required to be maintained at the

        disclose information specified in the request;
            (2) provides to the requesting party, in a manner that is

        covered information that will be disclosed to a third party, 
        any fees collected by the operator to cover administrative 
        costs, and the purposes for which the covered information will

            (3) ensures that the third party agrees, in writing or an 
        electronic equivalent--

                pursuant to the request for any purpose other than 
                fulfilling the purpose for which the request was made;
                    (B) not to disclose to subsequent third parties any 
                covered information received pursuant to the request;

operator by another entity (including any subsequent merger or 
acquisition), provided that the operator or successor entity continues 
to be subject to the provisions of this section with respect to covered 
information acquired before the merger or acquisition.
    (e) Continued Application.--This section shall continue to apply, 
after a student is no longer enrolled in an elementary school or

        families;

        information for maintaining, developing, supporting, improving, 
        or diagnosing the operator's school service;
            (6) be construed to prohibit an operator of a school 
        service from marketing educational products directly to 
        parents, provided that the marketing does not result from the 
        use of covered information;
            (7) impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store, 
        gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or 
        downloading software or applications to review or enforce 
        compliance with this Act by operators of school services;
            (8) impede the ability of a student or the student's parent 
        to download, export, create, or otherwise save or maintain data 
        or documents created by or about the student or noncommercial 
        applications created by the student, except to the extent any 
        such activity would result in disclosure prohibited by this Act 
        of covered information of other students or users of a school 
        service; or
            (9) be construed to prohibit an operator from collecting a 
        reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of making a 
        disclosure under section 3(a)(5)(C).
    (b) De-Identified and Aggregated Covered Information.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act prohibits an operator 
        from--
                    (A) using de-identified and aggregated covered 
                information--
                            (i) within the operator's school service or 
                        other sites, services, or applications owned by 
                        the operator to improve educational products; 
                        or
                            (ii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
                        the operator's products or services, including 
                        in the marketing of such products or services; 
                        or
                    (B) disclosing de-identified and aggregated covered 
                information for research and development, including--
                            (i) research, development, and improvement 
                        of educational sites, services, and 
                        applications; and
                            (ii) advancements in the science of 
                        learning.
            (2) Steps to prevent re-identification or disaggregation.--
        If an operator uses or discloses covered information as 
        described in paragraph (1), the operator shall take reasonable 
        steps to ensure that the information cannot be manipulated in a 
        manner that would enable--
                    (A) identification of an individual to whom the 
                information relates; or
                    (B) disaggregation of aggregated information into 
                its component parts.
    (c) Power To Consent and Rights Regarding Information About 
Eligible Student.--Any provision of this Act that refers to the consent 
of the student's parent for the use or disclosure of covered 
information or the right of the student's parent to access or otherwise 
obtain, use, correct, request disclosure of, or request deletion of 
covered information, shall, in the case of covered information about an 
eligible student, be considered to refer to the consent or right of the 
student and not the student's parent.
    (d) No Effect on Consent Under Other Law.--Except as provided in 
section 5(g), this Act does not modify the requirements or standards 
for consent, including consent from minors and employees on behalf of 
educational institutions, under any other provision of Federal law or 
under State law.

SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        this Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be 
        treated as a violation of a regulation under section 
        18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
        57a(a)(1)(B)) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices.
            (2) Powers of the commission.--The Commission shall enforce 
        this Act and the regulations promulgated under this Act in the 
        same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
        powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and 
        provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et 
        seq.) were incorporated into and made a part of this Act, and 
        any person who violates this Act or a regulation promulgated 
        under this Act shall be subject to the penalties entitled to 
        the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act, except as provided in paragraph (3).
            (3) Enforcement with respect to non-profit organizations.--
        Notwithstanding sections 4 and 5(a)(2) of the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 44; 45(a)(2)), any jurisdictional 
        limitation of the Commission with respect to nonprofit 
        organizations shall not apply for purposes of this Act.
    (b) Preservation of Commission Authority.--Nothing in this Act may 
be construed in any way to limit or affect the Commission's authority 
under any other provision of law.
    (c) Regulations.--The Commission may promulgate regulations under 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to carry out this Act.
    (d) Consultation and Cooperation With Secretary of Education.--The 
Commission shall consult and cooperate with the Secretary of Education 
in implementing and enforcing this Act, including in promulgating any 
regulations to carry out this Act, in matters involving educational 
agencies or institutions.
    (e) Report by Commission.--Not later than 1 year after the 
effective date described in section 6, and annually thereafter, the

Web site of the Commission a report on the number, scope, and nature of 
the data breaches about which the Commission receives notice under 
section 3(b)(6).
    (f) Guidance and Technical Assistance From Secretary of 
Education.--The Secretary of Education shall provide educational

assistance with respect to preventing and responding to data breaches 
involving unauthorized acquisition of or access to personally 
identifiable information that occur on a school service, in compliance 
with any obligations imposed by Federal or State law.
    (g) Relationship to State Law.--
            (1) In general.--This Act does not annul, alter, or affect, 
        or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this Act from 
        complying with, the laws of any State with respect to the 
        treatment of covered information by operators of school 
        services, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent 
        with any provision of this Act, and then only to the extent of 
        the inconsistency. For purposes of this paragraph, a law of a 
        State is not inconsistent with this Act if the protection such 
        law affords any user of a school service is greater than the 
        protection provided by this Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Any reference in this Act to 
        State law shall be considered also to refer to the law of a 
        political subdivision of a State.
