                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title 10, United States Code, to require the Secretary of 
  Defense to use only human-based methods for training members of the 
        Armed Forces in the treatment of severe combat injuries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Battlefield Excellence through 
Superior Training Practices Act'' or ``BEST Practices Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has made impressive strides 
        in the development and use of methods of medical training and 
        troop protection, such as the use of tourniquets and 
        improvements in body armor, that have led to decreased 
        battlefield fatalities.
            (2) The Department of Defense uses more than 8,500 live 
        animals each year to train physicians, medics, corpsmen, and 
        other personnel methods of responding to severe battlefield 
        injuries.
            (3) The civilian sector has almost exclusively phased in 
        the use of superior human-based training methods for numerous 
        medical procedures currently taught in military courses using 
        animals.
            (4) Human-based medical training methods such as simulators 
        replicate human anatomy and can allow for repetitive practice 
        and data collection.
            (5) According to scientific, peer-reviewed literature, 
        medical simulation increases patient safety and decreases 
        errors by healthcare providers.
            (6) The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command 
        and other entities of the Department of Defense have taken 
        significant steps to develop methods to replace live animal-
        based training.
            (7) According to the report by the Department of Defense 
        titled ``Final Report on the use of Live Animals in Medical 
        Education and Training Joint Analysis Team'', published on July 
        12, 2009--
                    (A) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to 
                have been available for nearly every high-volume or 
                high-value battlefield medical procedure by the end of 
                2011, and many were available as of 2009; and
                    (B) validated, high-fidelity simulators were to 
                have been available to teach all other procedures to 
                respond to common battlefield injuries by 2014.
            (8) The Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness 
        Skills of the Air Force exclusively uses human-based training 
        methods in its courses and does not use animals.
            (9) In 2013, the Army instituted a policy forbidding non-
        medical personnel from participating in training courses 
        involving the use of animals.
            (10) In 2013, the medical school of the Department of 
        Defense, part of the Uniformed Services University of the 
        Health Sciences, replaced animal use within its medical student 
        curriculum.
            (11) The Coast Guard announced in 2014 that it would reduce 
        by half the number of animals it uses for combat trauma 
        training courses but stated that animals would continue to be 
        used in courses designed for Department of Defense personnel.
            (12) Effective January 1, 2015, the Department of Defense 
        replaced animal use in six areas of medical training, including 
        Advanced Trauma Life Support courses and the development and 
        maintenance of surgical and critical care skills for field 
        operational surgery and field assessment and skills tests for 
        international students offered at the Defense Institute of 
        Medical Operations.
