    Section 623(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s-
2(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(10) Rehabilitation of qualified education loans.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of this section, a consumer may request to 
                remove a previously reported default regarding a 
                qualified education loan from the consumer report 
                relating to the consumer, and such request shall not be 
                considered inaccurate, if the consumer to whom such 
                loan relates successfully and voluntarily meets the 
                requirements of a private loan rehabilitation program 
                in which the number of consecutive on-time monthly 
                payments (in accordance with the terms and conditions 
                of the loan or any valid and legally binding 
                modification thereto) is equal to the number of 
                payments specified under section 428F(a)(1)(A) of the 
                Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1078-
                6(a)(1)(A)).
                    ``(B) Limitation.--A consumer may obtain the 
                benefits available under this subsection with respect 
                to rehabilitating a loan only one time per loan.
                    ``(C) Qualified education loan defined.--For 
                purposes of this subparagraph, the term `qualified 
                education loan' has the meaning given such term under 
                section 221(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.''.

SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.
