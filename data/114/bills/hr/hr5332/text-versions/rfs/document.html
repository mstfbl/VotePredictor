Received; read twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

                                 AN ACT


 
To ensure that the United States promotes the meaningful participation 
  of women in mediation and negotiation processes seeking to prevent, 
                 mitigate, or resolve violent conflict.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Women, Peace, and Security Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Around the world, women remain under-represented in 
        conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict 
        peace building efforts.
            (2) Despite the historic under-representation of women in 
        conflict resolution processes, women in conflict-affected 
        regions have nevertheless achieved significant success in--
                    (A) moderating violent extremism;
                    (B) countering terrorism;
                    (C) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation 
                and negotiation; and
                    (D) stabilizing societies by enhancing the 
                effectiveness of security services, peacekeeping 
                efforts, institutions, and decision-making processes.
            (3) Research shows that--
                    (A) peace negotiations are more likely to end in a 
                peace agreement when women's groups play an influential 
                role in the negotiation process;
                    (B) once reached, a peace agreement is 35 percent 
                more likely to last at least 15 years if women have 
                participated in the negotiation process; and
                    (C) when women meaningfully participate, peace 
                negotiations are more likely to address the underlying 
                causes of the conflict, leading to more sustainable 
                outcomes.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the meaningful participation of women in conflict 
        prevention and conflict resolution processes helps to promote 
        more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to the 
        long-term stability of countries and regions;
            (2) the political participation and leadership of women in 
        fragile environments, particularly during democratic 
        transitions, is critical to sustaining lasting democratic 
        institutions; and
            (3) the United States should be a global leader in 
        promoting the meaningful participation of women in conflict 
        prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict 
        relief and recovery efforts.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to promote the 
meaningful participation of women in all aspects of conflict 
prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict relief and 
recovery efforts, reinforced through diplomatic efforts and programs 
that--
            (1) integrate the perspectives and interests of affected 
        women into conflict-prevention activities and strategies;
            (2) encourage partner governments to adopt plans to improve 
        the meaningful participation of women in peace and security 
        processes and decision-making institutions;
            (3) promote the physical safety, economic security, and 
        dignity of women and girls;
            (4) support the equal access of women to aid distribution 
        mechanisms and services;
            (5) collect and analyze gender data for the purpose of 
        developing and enhancing early warning systems of conflict and 
        violence;
            (6) adjust policies and programs to improve outcomes in 
        gender equality and the empowerment of women; and
            (7) monitor, analyze, and evaluate the efforts related to 
        each strategy submitted under section 5 and the impact of such 
        efforts.

single government-wide strategy, to be known as the Women, Peace, and 
Security Strategy, that provides a detailed description of how the 
United States intends to fulfill the policy objectives in section 4. 
The strategy shall--
            (1) support and be aligned with plans developed by other 
        countries to improve the meaningful participation of women in 
        peace and security processes, conflict prevention, peace 
        building, transitional processes, and decision-making 
        institutions; and
            (2) include specific and measurable goals, benchmarks, 
        performance metrics, timetables, and monitoring and evaluation 
        plans, to ensure the accountability and effectiveness of all 
        policies and initiatives carried out under the strategy.

(a) shall include a specific implementation plan from each of the

        contributions, to implement the strategy; and

implementation of the strategy and the plan and to contribute to the 
report under section 8(b).
    (d) Coordination.--The President should promote the meaningful 
participation of women in conflict prevention, in coordination and

organizations, stakeholders, and other relevant international 
organizations, particularly in situations in which the direct 
engagement of the United States is not appropriate or advisable.
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President, in implementing each strategy submitted under subsection

        stakeholders;
            (2) address security-related barriers to the meaningful 
        participation of women;

        rule of law, or professional military education;
            (4) support appropriate local organizations, especially 
        women's peace building organizations;
            (5) support the training, education, and mobilization of 
        men and boys as partners in support of the meaningful 
        participation of women;
            (6) encourage the development of transitional justice and 
        accountability mechanisms that are inclusive of the experiences 
        and perspectives of women and girls;
            (7) expand and apply gender analysis to improve program 
        design and targeting; and
            (8) conduct assessments that include the perspectives of 
        women before implementing any new initiatives in support of 
        peace negotiations, transitional justice and accountability, 
        efforts to counter violent extremism, or security sector 
        reform.
