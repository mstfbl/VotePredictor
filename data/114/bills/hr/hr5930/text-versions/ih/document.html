                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Commission on the Social Status of Black Men and Boys, 
to study and make recommendations to address social problems affecting 
                          Black men and boys.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on the Social Status of 
Black Men and Boys Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Black men and boys face disproportionate hardships that 
        result in disparities in areas including: education, criminal 
        justice, health, employment, fatherhood, mentorship, and 
        violence. These hardships have negative consequences for 
        national productivity, especially for Black families and 
        communities.
            (2) A Commission to study and examine issues which 
        disproportionately have a negative impact on Black men and boys 
        in America will signal that the issues facing the Black male 
        population are a national priority, will develop solutions to 
        these hardships, and will help eliminate the obstacles facing 
        Black men and boys.
            (3) A Commission will also be able to investigate potential 
        civil rights violations affecting this population that attract 
        national attention.
            (4) Black babies are three times more likely to be born in 
        poverty and rapidly fall behind their White counterparts in 
        cognitive development.
            (5) By fourth grade, Black students are expected to be 
        three years behind White male students. According to the 
        Educational Testing Service Policy Informational Center, only 
        12 percent of Black eighth-grade male students are proficient 
        in math, compared to 44 percent of White eighth-grade male 
        students.
            (6) The Educational Testing Service Policy Informational 
        Center also found that nationally, more than 50 percent of 
        Black male students attending urban schools will drop out.
            (7) The low rate of high school retention among Black male 
        students directly relates to high rates of joblessness and 
        incarceration among this population. This barrier to employment 
        exacerbates cycles of poverty, which in turn results in health 
        inequalities, including higher levels of diabetes, obesity, and 
        HIV/AIDS. According to a study by the American Academy of Arts 
        and Sciences, more than 66 percent of Black male dropouts are 
        expected to serve time in State or Federal prison.
            (8) Black men are subjected to unequal profiling by the 
        police and disproportionately harsh sentences in the judicial 
        system. The Black male population is six times more likely to 
        become incarcerated than their White counterparts. Although the 
        Black male population comprises approximately six percent of 
        the United States population, of the 2,300,000 people 
        incarcerated nationwide, 1 million are Black males. Black males 
        receive ten percent longer Federal sentences than White males 
        who commit the same crime.
            (9) According to the Bureau of Statistics and the Pew 
        Research Center, Black male unemployment is consistently almost 
        double that of White male unemployment.
            (10) Black fathers are more than twice as likely to live 
        apart from their children as White fathers.
            (11) Young boys with male mentors are more likely to 
        progress further in school and have greater financial success 
        in life.
