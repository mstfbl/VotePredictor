Transportation of the Senate a report that contains the recommendations 
of the Commission (and data supporting such recommendations) 
regarding--
            (1) whether the exception provided by subsection (a) should 
        be made permanent; and
            (2) whether the definition of the term ``small business'' 
        for purposes of such exception should be modified from the 
        definition in subsection (d)(2).
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Broadband internet access service.--The term 
        ``broadband Internet access service'' has the meaning given

        Regulations.
            (2) Small business.--The term ``small business'' means any

        than 250,000 subscribers.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 16, 2016.
