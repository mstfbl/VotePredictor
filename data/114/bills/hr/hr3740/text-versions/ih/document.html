SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Integrated Transportation and 
Economic Development Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) National goals.--The national goals of the Federal-aid 
        highway program are prescribed in section 150 of title 23, 
        United States Code, as follows:
                    (A) Safety.--To achieve a significant reduction in 
                traffic fatalities and serious injuries on all public 
                roads.
                    (B) Infrastructure condition.--To maintain the 
                highway infrastructure asset system in a state of good 
                repair.
                    (C) Congestion reduction.--To achieve a significant 
                reduction in congestion on the National Highway System.
                    (D) System reliability.--To improve the efficiency 
                of the surface transportation system.
                    (E) Freight movement and economic vitality.--To 
                improve the national freight network, strengthen the 
                ability of rural communities to access national and 
                international trade markets, and support regional 
                economic development.
                    (F) Environmental sustainability.--To enhance the 
                performance of the transportation system while 
                protecting and enhancing the natural environment.
                    (G) Reduced project delivery delays.--To reduce 
                project costs, promote jobs and the economy, and 
                expedite the movement of people and goods by 
                accelerating project completion through eliminating 
                delays in the project development and delivery process, 
                including reducing regulatory burdens and improving 
                agencies' work practices.
            (2) Performance measures.--Section 150 of title 23, United 
        States Code, requires the Secretary of Transportation to 
        establish performance measures for States to use to assess 
        progress towards the achievement of the national goals of the 
        Federal-aid highway program.
            (3) Performance targets.--Section 150 of such title also 
        requires each State to set performance targets that reflect the 
        performance measures established by the Secretary of 
        Transportation and to submit periodic reports to the Secretary 
        that describe progress in achieving the performance targets.
            (4) Equitable distribution.--It is important that both 
        urban and rural communities in the United States benefit from 
        the Federal-aid highway program and receive an equitable 
        distribution of Federal transportation funds.
            (5) Importance of public roads and highways for 
        economically distressed urban communities.--Public roads and 
        highways that are safe, reliable, and in a state of good repair 
        are especially important for economically distressed urban 
        communities.
            (6) Needs of economically distressed urban communities.--
        Not one of the national goals of the Federal-aid highway 
        program mention the needs of economically distressed urban 
        communities.
            (7) New goal.--The national goals of the Federal-aid 
        highway program need to be amended to include a goal to improve 
        road conditions in economically distressed urban communities 
        and increase access to jobs, markets, and economic 
        opportunities for people who live in these communities.

SEC. 3. NEW NATIONAL GOAL, PERFORMANCE MEASURE, PERFORMANCE TARGET.

    (a) National Goal.--Section 150(b) of title 23, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) Integrated economic development.--To improve road

        for people who live in such communities.''.
