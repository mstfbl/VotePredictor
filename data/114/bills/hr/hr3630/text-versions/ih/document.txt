                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide assistance 
   for programs and activities to protect the water quality of Puget 
                     Sound, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting United Government Efforts 
to Save Our Sound Act'' or the ``PUGET SOS Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Puget Sound and its tributary waters are one of the 
        most ecologically diverse ecosystems in North America with 
        natural resources that have ecological, economic, and cultural 
        importance to the United States. The health and productivity of 
        Puget Sound is not only the cornerstone of the region's quality 
        of life and vibrant economy, but its commercial aquaculture, 
        agriculture, and port activities ripple throughout the Nation.
            (2) Threats to Puget Sound, such as water pollution, 
        sediment contamination, environmental degradation, and habitat 
        loss, jeopardize the economic productivity and natural 
        resources that support the increasing population of the region.
            (3) For nearly a decade, State, local, and tribal 
        governments, cooperative partnerships, and concerned citizens 
        have worked together in a deliberate and coordinated way to 
        manage resource allocation toward habitat restoration, 
        improving water quality and shellfish farms, and developing a 
        body of scientific knowledge, all of which have advanced the 
        Puget Sound recovery efforts.
            (4) Despite significant and nationally recognized 
        accomplishments, the rate of damage to Puget Sound still 
        exceeds the rate of recovery. To outpace mounting pollutants 
        and other cascading negative impacts, the next step in 
        fortifying the recovery system is to align Federal recovery and 
        protection efforts seamlessly with State, local, and tribal 
        investments.
            (5) At this time, water and air pollution, sediment 
        contamination, habitat loss and decline, and water flow 
        disruption continue to devastate the fish, marine mammal, bird, 
        and shellfish populations of Puget Sound, threatening local 
        economies and tribal treaty rights and contributing to--
                    (A) significant declines in the populations of wild 
                Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, Summer Chum Salmon, 
                Steelhead, and Pacific Herring, which are essential 
                food sources for humans, fish, seabirds, mammals, and 
                other wildlife;
                    (B) risks to the sustainability of fish and 
                shellfish populations, and their food chains, 
                reproductive cycles, and habitats, which also threaten 
                Federal obligations to protect tribal culture, 
                traditions, and economies;
                    (C) 113 marine species being listed at risk or 
                vulnerable to extinction, according to State, Federal, 
                and provincial lists that identify the species of Puget 
                Sound and surrounding areas, including the iconic 
                population of southern resident Orca whales;
                    (D) sediment contaminated with toxic substances 
                (such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals 
                (mercury), and oil (grease)), all of which are 
                polluting Puget Sound, threatening public health, and 
                posing significant dangers to humans, fish, and 
                wildlife;
                    (E) rivers and beaches that fail to meet water 
                quality standards and become unsafe for business and 
                recreational activities, such as fishing and swimming;
                    (F) the closing of shellfish beds from contaminated 
                pollution caused by sources such as stormwater and 
                agricultural runoff; and
                    (G) mortalities and morbidity in shellfish due to 
                the acidification of Puget Sound.

SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY; PURPOSE.

    (a) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that the Federal Government should support, partner, and collaborate 
with the regional efforts that are addressing environmental and natural 
resource issues involving Puget Sound because--
            (1) Puget Sound is a national treasure, the recovery and 
        protection of which will significantly contribute to the 
        environmental, cultural, and economic well-being of the United 
        States;
            (2) a more deliberate coordination of Federal investments 
        with regional, local, and tribal recovery and preservation 
        efforts will be the most effective and efficient use of public 
        resources; and
            (3) it is the role of the Federal Government to align its 
        efforts and resources to--
                    (A) fully implement and enforce the goals of the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Endangered 
                Species Act of 1973, and all other Federal laws that 
                contribute to the recovery and protection of Puget 
                Sound;
                    (B) uphold Federal trust responsibilities to 
                restore and protect resources crucial to tribal treaty 
                rights;
                    (C) support regional, local, and tribal efforts to 
                address environmental challenges and
                    (D) encourage local citizen and community 
                stewardship.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that the 
recovery and protection programs, projects, and initiatives that the 
Federal Government undertakes in, or that otherwise impact, Puget Sound 
are actively coordinated and aligned with the protection of tribal 
treaty rights as well as State, regional, local, and tribal Puget Sound 
recovery efforts, as reflected in the Action Agenda, a regionally 
developed, federally approved plan, in order to make the most efficient 
and effective use of Federal and other public resources.
