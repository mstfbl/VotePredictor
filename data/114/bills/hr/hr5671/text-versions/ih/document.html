    (a) Primary Goal.--
            (1) Development of national plan.--The primary goal of the 
        Working Group is to develop a national plan--
                    (A) to reduce, within 10 years after the date on 
                which funding is made available to carry out this Act--
                            (i) the number of children living in 
                        poverty in the United States to half of the 
                        number of such children as reported in the 
                        report of the United States Census Bureau on 
                        Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage 
                        in the United States: 2013 (issued in September 
                        2014); and
                            (ii) the number of children living in 
                        extreme poverty in the United States to zero; 
                        and
                    (B) to reduce, within 20 years after the date on 
                which funds are made available to carry out this Act, 
                the number of children living in poverty in the United 
                States to zero.
            (2) Consultation with national academy of sciences.--In 
        developing the national plan under paragraph (1), the Working 
        Group shall consider all recommendations, research papers, and 
        reports published by the National Academy of Sciences as a 
        result of the workshops conducted pursuant to title II.
            (3) Deadline.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Working Group shall make 
        substantial progress toward the development of the national 
        plan.
    (b) Additional Goals.--The national plan under subsection (a) shall 
include recommendations for achieving the following goals:
            (1) Understanding the root causes of child poverty, 
        including persistent intergenerational poverty, taking into 
        account social, economic, and cultural factors.
            (2) Improving the accessibility of anti-poverty programs 
        and increasing the rate of enrollment in such programs among 
        eligible children and families by reducing the complexity and 
        difficulty of enrolling in such programs.
            (3) Eliminating disparate rates of child poverty based on 
        race, ethnicity, gender, and age.
            (4) Improving the ability of individuals living in poverty, 
        low-income individuals, and unemployed individuals to access 
        quality jobs that help children and their families rise above 
        poverty.
            (5) Connecting low-income children, disconnected youth, and 
        their families to education, job training, work, and their 
        communities.
            (6) Shifting the measures and policies of Federal anti-
        poverty programs from the goal of helping individuals and 
        families living in poverty to achieve freedom from deprivation 
        toward the goal of helping such individuals and families rise 
        above poverty and achieve long-term economic stability.
    (c) Methods.--In developing the national plan under subsection (a), 
the Working Group shall employ methods for achieving the goals 
described in subsections (a) and (b) that include--
            (1) entering into an agreement with the National Academy of 
        Sciences for a workshop series on the economic and social costs 
        of child poverty, as described in title II;
            (2) studying the effect of child poverty on the health and 
        welfare of children, including the access of children living in

SEC. 213. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Youth gang crime has taken a toll on a number of 
        communities, and senseless acts of gang-related violence have 
        imposed economic, social, and human costs.
            (2) Drug- and alcohol-dependent youth, and youth dually 
        diagnosed with addiction and mental health disorders, are more 
        likely to become involved with the juvenile justice system than 
        youth without such risk factors, absent appropriate prevention 
        and intervention services.
            (3) Children of color are over-represented relative to the 
        general population at every stage of the juvenile justice 
        system. Black youth are 17 percent of the United States 
        population, but represent 38 percent of youth in secure 
        placement juvenile facilities, and 58 percent of youth 
        incarcerated in adult prisons.
            (4) Research funded by the Department of Justice indicates 
        that gang membership is short-lived among adolescents. With 
        very few youth remaining gang-involved throughout their 
        adolescent years, ongoing opportunities for intervention exist.
            (5) Criminal justice costs have become burdensome in many 
        States and cities, requiring reductions in vital educational, 
        social, welfare, mental health, and related services.
            (6) Direct expenditures for each of the major criminal 
        justice functions, police, corrections, and judicial services, 
        have increased steadily over the last 30 years. In fiscal year 
        2012, Federal, State, and local governments spent an estimated 
        $265,000,000,000 for police protection, corrections, and 
        judicial and legal services, nearly a 213-percent increase 
        since 1982.
            (7) Estimates suggest that each year the United States 
        incurs over $8,000,000,000 in long-term costs for the 
        confinement of young people. The average annual cost to 
        incarcerate one youth is $146,302.
            (8) Coordinated efforts of stakeholders in the juvenile 
        justice system in a local community, together with other 
        organizations and community members concerned with the safety 
        and welfare of children, have a strong record of demonstrated 
        success in reducing the impact of youth and gang-related crime 
        and violence, as demonstrated in Boston, Massachusetts; 
        Chicago, Illinois; Richmond, Virginia; Los Angeles, California; 
        and other communities.
            (9) Investment in prevention and intervention programs for 
        children and youth, including quality early childhood programs, 
        comprehensive evidence-based school, after school, and summer 
        school programs, mentoring programs, mental health and 
        treatment programs, evidence-based job training programs, and 
        alternative intervention programs, has been shown to lead to 
        decreased youth arrests, decreased delinquency, lower 
        recidivism, and greater financial savings from an educational, 
        economic, social, and criminal justice perspective.
            (10) Quality early childhood education programs have been 
        demonstrated to help children start school ready to learn and 
        to reduce delinquency and criminal street gang activity risks.
            (11) Evidence-based mentoring programs have been shown to 
        prevent youth drug abuse and violence.
            (12) Evidence-based school-based comprehensive 
        instructional programs that pair youth with responsible adult 
        mentors have been shown to have a strong impact upon 
        delinquency prevention.
            (13) After-school programs that connect children to caring 
        adults and that provide constructive activities during the peak 
        hours of juvenile delinquency and criminal street gang 
        activity, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., have been shown to reduce 
        delinquency and the attendant costs imposed on the juvenile and 
        criminal justice systems.
            (14) States with higher levels of educational attainment 
        have been shown to have crime rates lower than the national 
        average. Researchers have found that a 5-percent increase in 
        male high school graduation rates would produce an annual 
        estimated savings of $18,500,000,000 in crime-related expenses.
            (15) Therapeutic programs that engage and motivate high-
        risk youth and their families to change behaviors that often 
        result in criminal activity have been shown to significantly 
        reduce recidivism among juvenile offenders, and significantly 
        reduce the attendant costs of crime and delinquency imposed 
        upon the juvenile and criminal justice systems.
            (16) Comprehensive programs that target kids who are 
        already serious juvenile offenders by addressing the multiple 
        factors in peer, school, neighborhood, and family environments 
        known to be related to delinquency can reduce recidivism among 
        juvenile offenders and save the public significant economic 
        costs.
            (17) There are many alternatives to incarceration of youth 
        that have been proven to be more effective in reducing crime 
        and violence at the National, State, local, and tribal levels, 
        and the failure to provide for such effective alternatives is a 
        pervasive problem that leads to increased youth, and later 
        adult, crime and violence.
            (18) Savings achieved through early intervention and 
        prevention are significant, especially when noncriminal justice 
        social, educational, mental health, and economic outcomes are 
        considered.
            (19) The prevention of child abuse and neglect can help 
        stop a cycle of violence and save up to $5.00 for every $1.00 
        invested in preventing such abuse and neglect.
            (20) Targeting interventions at special youth risk groups 
        and focusing upon relatively low-cost interventions increases 
        the probability of fiscal benefit.
            (21) Evidence-based intervention treatment facilities have 
        been shown to reduce youth delinquency and to be cost-
        effective.
            (22) States, including Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Texas, 
        and Pennsylvania, have seen a reduction in juvenile
