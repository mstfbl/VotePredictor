                                 AN ACT


 
  To require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to the 
  appropriate congressional committees on the estimated total assets 
under direct or indirect control by certain senior Iranian leaders and 
                 other figures, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iranian Leadership Asset 
Transparency Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Iran is characterized by high levels of official and 
        institutional corruption, and substantial involvement by Iran's 
        security forces, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
        Corps (IRGC), in the economy.
            (2) Many members of Iran's senior political and military 
        leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional 
        wealth by using their positions to secure control of 
        significant portions of Iran's national economy.
            (3) Sanctions relief provided through the Joint 
        Comprehensive Plan of Action has resulted in the removal of 
        many Iranian entities that are tied to governmental corruption 
        from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States.
            (4) The Department of Treasury in 2011 designated the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran's financial sector as a jurisdiction 
        of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the 
        USA PATRIOT Act, stating ``Treasury has for the first time 
        identified the entire Iranian financial sector; including 
        Iran's Central Bank, private Iranian banks, and branches, and 
        subsidiaries of Iranian banks operating outside of Iran as 
        posing illicit finance risks for the global financial 
        system.''.
            (5) Iran continues to be listed by the Financial Action 
        Task Force (FATF) among the ``Non-Cooperative Countries or 
        Territories''--countries which it perceived to be non-
        cooperative in the global fight against terror finance and 
        money laundering.
            (6) Iran and North Korea are the only countries listed by 
        the FATF as ``Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories'' 
        against which FATF countries should take measures.
            (7) The Transparency International index of perceived 
        public corruption ranks Iran 130th out of 168 countries 
        surveyed.
            (8) The State Department identified Iran as a country/
        jurisdiction of ``primary concern'' for money laundering in its 
        2014 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR).
            (9) The State Department currently identifies Iran, along 
        with Sudan and Syria, as a state sponsor of terrorism, ``having 
        repeatedly provided support for acts of international 
        terrorism''.
            (10) The State Department's ``Country Reports on 
        Terrorism'', published last in June 2015 noted that ``Iran 
        continued to sponsor terrorist groups around the world, 
        principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods 
        Force (IRGC-QF). These groups included Lebanese Hizballah, 
        several Iraqi Shia militant groups, Hamas, and Palestine 
        Islamic Jihad. Iran, Hizballah, and other Shia militia 
        continued to provide support to the Asad regime, dramatically 
        bolstering its capabilities, prolonging the civil war in Syria, 
        and worsening the human rights and refugee crisis there.''.
            (11) The Iranian Government's tolerance of corruption and 
        nepotism in business limits opportunities for foreign and 
        domestic investment, particularly given the significant 
        involvement of the IRGC in many sectors of Iran's economy.
            (12) The IRGC and the leadership-controlled bonyads 
        (foundations) control an estimated one-third of Iran's total 
        economy, including large portions of Iran's telecommunications, 
        construction, and airport and port operations. These operations 
        give the IRGC and bonyads vast funds to support terrorist 
        organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas.
            (13) By gaining control of major economic sectors, the IRGC 
        and bonyads have also served to further disadvantage the 
        average Iranian.

              CERTAIN SENIOR POLITICAL FIGURES.

            (1) the estimated total funds or assets held in accounts at
