                                 A BILL


 
To develop a database of projects that are proven or promising in terms 
                of moving welfare recipients into work.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Using Evidence to Move Welfare 
Recipients into Work Act''.

SEC. 2. WHAT WORKS CLEARINGHOUSE.

    Section 413 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 613) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:
    ``(k) Development of What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and 
Promising Approaches Into Move Welfare Recipients to Work.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
        Secretary of Labor, shall develop a database (which shall be 
        referred to as the `What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and 
        Promising Projects to Move Welfare Recipients into Work') of 
        the projects that used a proven approach or a promising 
        approach in moving welfare recipients into work, based on 
        independent, rigorous evaluations of the projects. The database 
        shall include a separate listing of projects that used a 
        developmental approach in delivering services and a further 
        separate listing of the projects that used an approach in 
        delivering services that was proven to be ineffective in 
        achieving positive outcomes. The Secretary shall add to the 
        What Works Clearinghouse of Proven and Promising Projects to 
        Move Welfare Recipients into Work data about the projects that, 
        based on an independent, well-conducted experimental evaluation 
        of a program or project, using random assignment or other 
        research methodologies that allow for the strongest possible 
        causal inferences, have shown they are proven, promising, 
        developmental, or ineffective approaches.
            ``(2) Criteria for evidence of effectiveness of approach.--
        The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and 
        organizations with experience in evaluating research on the 
        effectiveness of various approaches in delivering services to 
        move welfare recipients into work, shall--
                    ``(A) establish criteria for evidence of the 
                effectiveness of the approaches used in the 
                demonstration projects; and
                    ``(B) ensure that the process for establishing the 
                criteria--
                            ``(i) is transparent;
                            ``(ii) is consistent across agencies;
                            ``(iii) provides opportunity for public 
                        comment; and
                            ``(iv) takes into account efforts of 
                        Federal agencies to identify and publicize 
                        effective interventions, including efforts at 
                        the Department of Health and Human Services, 
                        the Department of Education, and the Department 
                        of Justice.
