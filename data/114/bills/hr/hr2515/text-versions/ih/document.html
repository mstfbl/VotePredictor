SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Risk of death among individuals with anorexia nervosa 
        is 18 times greater than their same age peers without anorexia. 
        It is estimated that at least one person dies every 62 minutes 
        from an eating disorder; at least 23 persons each day.
            (2) Health consequences such as osteoporosis (brittle 
        bones), gastrointestinal complications, cardiac, and dental 
        problems are significant health and financial burdens 
        throughout life.
            (3) At lowest estimate, 14.5 million Americans suffer from 
        eating disorders. One percent of adolescent boys and two 
        percent of adolescent girls suffer from eating disorders; 
        eating disorders account for at least four percent of all 
        childhood hospitalizations.
            (4) Eating disorders are treatable biopsychosocial 
        illnesses. There is a high rate of co-morbidity with other 
        illnesses such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety 
        disorders.
            (5) Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by 
        self-starvation, weight loss, fear of gaining weight and 
        disturbances in the way in which one's body weight or shape is 
        experienced (body image disturbance).
            (6) Anorexia nervosa is associated with serious health 
        consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, 
        osteoporosis, and death. People who suffer anorexia nervosa are 
        57 times more likely to die of suicide than their peers.
            (7) Current estimates of the lifetime prevalence of bulimia 
        nervosa are between 0.9 and 1.5 percent among women and between 
        0.1 and 0.5 percent among men.
            (8) Bulimia nervosa is associated with serious health 
        consequences, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental 
        problems including irregular heartbeats, gastric rupture, 
        peptic ulcer, tooth decay, and death.
            (9) Binge eating disorder is characterized by frequent 
        episodes of uncontrolled overeating. Binge eating disorder is 
        common: at lowest estimate, 3.5 percent of American women and 
        2.0 percent of American men will suffer from this disorder in 
        their lifetime.
            (10) Binge eating is often associated with obesity, high 
        blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, elevated 
        triglyceride levels, increased risk of bowel, breast and 
        reproductive cancers, increased risk of diabetes, and increased 
        risk of arthritic damage to the joints.
            (11) Many suffer from some, but not all, of the symptoms of 
        anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder, 
        which is referred to as other specified feeding or eating 
        disorder (OSFED). Between 4 percent and 20 percent of young 
        women practice unhealthy patterns of dieting, purging, and 
        binge eating.
            (12) Eating disorders are more common in women, but they do 
        occur in men. Rates of binge eating disorder are similar in 
        females and males.
            (13) Academic evidence has demonstrated a connection 
        between the use of very thin models in advertising and consumer 
        attitudes toward a brand based on such advertising, as well as 
        a material influence of the use of such models on consumer 
        purchase intent, conduct, and reliance.
            (14) Eating disorders appear across all age groups, races, 
        ethnicities and socioeconomic groups in the United States and 
        are associated with substantial psychological problems, 
        including depression, substance abuse, and suicide. For 
        children 12 years of age and younger, hospitalizations for 
        eating disorders increased by 119 percent between 1999 and 
        2006.
