                                 A BILL


 
   To encourage the warring parties of South Sudan to resolve their 
              conflict peacefully, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``South Sudan Peace Promotion and 
Accountability Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In December 2013, tensions between political leaders 
        sparked a new civil conflict in South Sudan that has killed 
        tens of thousands, displaced an estimated two million people, 
        including over 500,000 refugees, and left 4.6 million people--
        40 percent of the population--facing the threat of extreme 
        hunger and in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.
            (2) Since the United States helped broker the 2005 
        Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ultimately set the 
        framework for the 2011 South Sudan referendum in which the 
        people of South Sudan chose independence, the United States has 
        remained the leading donor to South Sudan.
            (3) The warring parties have repeatedly impeded and 
        interfered with the delivery of humanitarian assistance and 
        threatened aid workers, showing little regard for the dire 
        conditions facing the people of South Sudan.
            (4) The warring parties have often defied international 
        humanitarian and human rights law, committing acts of sexual 
        violence, recruiting and using children as soldiers, and 
        targeting and killing civilians based on their ethnicity or 
        perceived allegiances, among other atrocities.
            (5) While representatives of the warring parties agreed in 
        the January 21, 2015, Arusha Communique that they bear full 
        responsibility for South Sudan's crisis and that those 
        individuals responsible for atrocities should be held 
        accountable, no party to the conflict has taken credible steps 
        to hold any senior civilian or military leader to account, and 
        instead continue to commit atrocities with impunity.
            (6) Eight commitments and recommitments to cease 
        hostilities have been broken, and the most recent round of 
        peace talks held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, under the auspices 
        of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) from 
        January 2014 through March 5, 2015, failed to bring meaningful 
        progress to end the war.
            (7) The African Union (AU) has joined the Intergovernmental 
        Authority on Development (IGAD) in pursuing other options to 
        bring peace in South Sudan, including discussion of targeted 
        sanctions on individuals in South Sudan who continue to 
        undermine the peace process.
            (8) Regional actors and other external entities continue to 
        undermine the peace process through various means, including 
        through the transfer of arms and other support to the warring 
        parties, and through the presence of foreign forces 
        participating in the conflict.
            (9) The proliferation of small arms in South Sudan 
        continues to fuel the killing of innocent civilians and is 
        instrumental in undermining the peace process.
            (10) Attempts to establish peace and stability in South 
        Sudan have not resulted in a comprehensive peace agreement, 
        including mediation supported by IGAD and initiatives to 
        address divisions within the Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
        (SPLM) by Tanzania and South Africa.
            (11) On March 3, 2015, the United Nations Security Council 
        (UNSC) adopted Security Council Resolution 2206 which condemned 
        the flagrant violations of the various cessation of hostilities 
        agreements, underscored its willingness to impose targeted 
        sanctions against those responsible for actions or policies 
        that threatened South Sudan's peace, security, or stability, 
        requested that the United Nations Secretary General form a 
        panel of experts to identify responsible individuals or 
        entities, and indicated a willingness to consider an arms 
        embargo in the future.
            (12) On April 3, 2014, President Obama signed Executive 
        Order 13664, which allows for additional targeted sanctions and 
        a visa ban against those individuals whose actions threaten the 
        peace, security or stability of South Sudan, obstruct the peace 
        talks and processes, undermine democratic institutions, or 
        commit human rights abuses. The Administration has already 
        designated four individuals under this order, two from the 
        Government of South Sudan and two from the opposition. Canada 
        and the European Union have implemented similar regimes.
            (13) On May 29, 2015, the Government of South Sudan 
        expelled the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator, Toby 
        Lanzer, who was tasked with overseeing the vast humanitarian 
        operation in South Sudan.
            (14) The date July 9, 2015, should signify and celebrate 
        South Sudan's independence and peaceful recovery from decades 
        of war, yet the violence against children in South Sudan has 
        reached a new level of brutality. Children are being 
        aggressively recruited into armed groups on both sides of the 
        conflict and forced to participate in a conflict not of their 
        making. The psychological and physical effects on these 
        children must be recognized and addressed and this violence 
        against the innocent must stop immediately.
    (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes that there has been a dramatic failure of 
        leadership in South Sudan that has left South Sudanese 
        civilians in a protracted and unacceptable state of suffering, 
        and that the United States stands in solidarity with the people 
        of South Sudan as they call for peace;
            (2) urges all parties involved in the conflict to 
        immediately cease all violence and work towards a negotiated, 
        publicly transparent settlement developed through diplomacy and 
        reconciliation, and urges that this process be inclusive to 
        South Sudanese civil society, including women and traditional 
        leaders, to bring about peace and stability in South Sudan;
            (3) stresses the need to adequately communicate to the 
        South Sudanese people the proposed process for the 
        establishment of a transitional government to carry South Sudan 
        through the development of a fully inclusive national dialogue, 
        constitutional and internal government reform, national peace 
        and reconciliation efforts, and eventually an inclusive, 
        credible process towards national elections;
            (4) stresses the need for the Administration to continue to 
        promote freedoms of association and expression in South Sudan, 
        and to support the growth of effective, resilient, and 
        empowered civil society organizations, particularly those 
        organizations that are transparent, representative, and promote 
        the active inclusion and participation of women and girls;
            (5) expresses concern over the March 23, 2015, decision of 
        the Parliament of South Sudan to extend by three years the 
        terms of President Kiir and other elected officials, and urges 
        the Government of South Sudan to ensure that this does not 
        curtail the urgent need for a negotiated peace agreement with 
        the opposition and a transitional government of national unity 
        as had been committed to by both parties in IGAD negotiations 
        on May 9, 2014;
            (6) welcomes the efforts by the Administration to push for 
        the public release of the full report by the AU Commission of 
        Inquiry (CoI) in South Sudan, and emphasizes the positive 
        impact the release of this report, and resulting prosecutions 
        of those individuals determined responsible for conflict or 
        human rights crimes, would have for accountability, justice, 
        and closure for the people of South Sudan;
            (7) calls on the United States Permanent Representative to 
        the United Nations to promote human rights monitoring carried 
        out by United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and 
        advocate for publicly releasing reports on the human rights 
        situation in South Sudan on a regular basis;
            (8) approves of the ongoing efforts by the Administration 
        to use the necessary tools, as outlined in Security Council 
        Resolution 2206, to increase pressure on the warring parties to 
        come to the negotiating table following the failure of the 
        parties to meet the March 5, 2015, IGAD deadline in Addis 
        Ababa, Ethiopia;
            (9) supports the ongoing efforts by the United States 
        Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the 
        voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United 
        Nations to work with regional countries and like-minded 
        countries to fully implement Security Council Resolution 2206;
            (10) applauds the United Nations Security Council and the 
        Department of the Treasury for imposing sanctions on 
        individuals on both sides of the conflict in South Sudan and 
        supports the efforts of the Department of the Treasury and the 
        Department of State to identify candidates for designation 
        under Executive Order 13664;
            (11) urges the Department of the Treasury to prioritize 
        investigative actions that uncover the illicit financial flows 
        fueling the ongoing violence and contributing to the extended 
        humanitarian suffering of the people caught in the conflict;
            (12) supports the establishment of a credible, independent 
        hybrid judicial court or investigation by the International 
        Criminal Court or other credible judicial court and for all 
        parties in South Sudan to deliberate in a peaceful manner for 
        transitional justice and a truth and reconciliation commission;
            (13) urges the Administration to continue to offer and 
        further expand support for resilience and development 
        programming in parts of South Sudan less affected by conflict 
        or otherwise suited for such programming in order to preserve 
        and expand where possible the fragile gains in health, 
        education, agricultural productivity, and economic development;
            (14) applauds the work of the United Nations peacekeeping 
        mission, which by sheltering over 100,000 people within its 
        compounds has saved thousands of live, as well as the 
        continuous humanitarian and human rights work in the region 
        from many national and international nongovernmental 
        organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations, faith-based 
        groups, and international organizations, and calls on all 
        parties to the conflict to respect and support the unfettered 
        access of humanitarian organizations to provide aid to all 
        civilian populations during humanitarian crises;
            (15) condemns the expulsion of Toby Lanzer, the United 
        Nations Humanitarian Coordinator by the Government of South 
        Sudan at a time when the humanitarian crisis continues to grow;
            (16) urges all parties to respect the neutrality of UNMISS 
        sites and expresses the need for the Administration to work 
        with the Government of South Sudan on its compliance with its 
        Status of Forces Agreement with UNMISS to ensure it is 
        respecting, supporting and protecting the work of UNMISS 
        personnel as they endeavor to protect internally displaced 
        people sheltering at UNMISS bases and those individuals outside 
        these bases who are displaced by the ongoing fighting; and
            (17) expresses the need for the Administration to 
        capitalize on opportunities to engage in dialogue at the 
        highest levels with like-minded members of the international 
        community to further promote positive engagement in South Sudan 
        to bring about a reform process that addresses the root causes 
        of this conflict.
