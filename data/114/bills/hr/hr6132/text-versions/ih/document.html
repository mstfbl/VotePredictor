                                 A BILL


 
To establish a task force to develop a national trauma care system, to 
 improve the trauma care system of the Department of Defense, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National Trauma 
Care System Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Trauma is the leading killer of Americans under the age 
        of 46 in the United States, killing more than 192,000 Americans 
        each year.
            (2) The National Research Council has indicated since 1966 
        that Federal funding for trauma research was inadequate--
        leading the Institute of Medicine in 1999 to conclude that, 
        ``The nation's current investment in injury [trauma] research 
        is not commensurate with the magnitude of the problem.''.
            (3) The National Academies of Sciences found that between 
        200,000 and 300,000 Americans may have died from survivable 
        traumatic injuries between 2001 and 2011.
            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, the economic burden of trauma was more than 
        $671,000,000,000 in 2013 and it is one of the most expensive 
        health care problems in the country.
            (5) According to the National Trauma Center, the National 
        Institutes of Health spends less than $200 each year on trauma 
        research for each year of potential life lost.
            (6) The Institute of Medicine has recommended greater 
        consideration of a disease's societal and economic burden when 
        allocating research funding.
            (7) Nearly all combat deaths in the Armed Forces are due to 
        trauma-related incidents, and between 2001 and 2011, nearly 25 
        percent of battlefield deaths were caused by survivable 
        injuries.
            (8) The 75th Ranger Regiment of the Army nearly eliminated 
        its preventable fatalities by implementing data-driven 
        performance improvement policies and taking command-ownership 
        of treatment outcomes.
            (9) Military and civilian trauma practitioners must be able 
        to share data, techniques, and procedures easily so they can 
        institutionalize advances in care within their respective 
        organizations.
            (10) The National Academy of Sciences concluded ``that a 
        national strategy and joint military-civilian approach for 
        improving trauma care is lacking, placing lives unnecessarily 
        at risk . . . that a unified effort is needed to address this 
        gap and ensure the delivery of optimal trauma care to save the 
        lives of Americans injured within the United States and on the 
        battlefield.''.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should establish and articulate a goal of 
        achieving zero preventable deaths after injury and minimizing 
        trauma-related disability and direct efforts towards that end;
            (2) the Federal Government should promote the development 
        of a learning health system that enables a continuous 
        improvement of military and civilian trauma systems through 
        evidence-based initiatives; and
            (3) the Federal Government should promote greater 
        collaboration between, and integration of, military and 
        civilian trauma systems, including with respect to the 
        permanent assignment of military trauma teams in civilian 
        trauma centers, to prepare for mass trauma incidents in the 
        homeland.
