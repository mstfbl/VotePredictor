                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
 program to provide service dogs to certain veterans with severe post-
                       traumatic stress disorder.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Puppies Assisting Wounded 
Servicemembers (PAWS) Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An estimated 14 percent of members of the Armed Forces 
        returning from active duty service in support of Operation 
        Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom suffer from post-
        traumatic stress disorder.
            (2) The resulting hyperstimulation of the fight-flight-
        freeze response associated with post-traumatic stress disorder 
        poses a threat to the successful societal reintegration of such 
        members of the Armed Forces.
            (3) Animals such as dogs can buffer this stress response 
        when humans fail to provide social support.
            (4) Interaction with dogs has been shown to modulate 
        symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as anxiety, 
        including fear response and hyperarousal, interpersonal 
        difficulties, social isolation, physical pain, and sleep 
        disturbances.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM ON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PROVISION OF 
              SERVICE DOGS TO CERTAIN VETERANS WITH SEVERE POST-
              TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting through 
the Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, shall
