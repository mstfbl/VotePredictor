SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Salmon 
Labeling Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    It is the purpose of this Act to--
            (1) ensure that consumers in the United States can make 
        informed decisions when purchasing salmon; and
            (2) authorize an independent scientific review of--
                    (A) the possible effects of genetically engineered 
                salmon on wild salmon stocks; and
                    (B) the Food and Drug Administration's approval of 
                genetically engineered salmon for human consumption.

SEC. 3. MARKET NAME FOR GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SALMON.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for 
purposes of applying the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.), the acceptable market name of any salmon that is 
genetically engineered shall include the words ``Genetically 
Engineered'' or ``GE'' prior to the existing acceptable market name.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, salmon is 
genetically engineered if it has been modified by recombinant DNA 
(rDNA) techniques, including the entire lineage of salmon that contain 
the rDNA modification.

SEC. 4. THIRD-PARTY REVIEW OF CERTAIN SALMON APPROVAL.

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure that an 
independent scientific organization conducts a review of the

application related to AquAdvantage Salmon, dated November 12, 2015.
