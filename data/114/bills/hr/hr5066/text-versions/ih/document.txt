                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the President to provide assistance to Israel to protect 
the coastline of Israel and natural gas fields located in the exclusive 
            economic zone of Israel, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel Maritime 
Security Partnership Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2010, a major natural gas field--named the Leviathan 
        gas field--was discovered off the coast of Israel.
            (2) It has been estimated that the Leviathan gas field and 
        the Tamar gas field, two major natural gas fields located 
        approximately 90 miles west of Haifa, contain 620 billion cubic 
        meters and 280 billion cubic meters of natural gas 
        respectively.
            (3) The two gas fields could have major geostrategic 
        implications for Israel and facilitate cooperation between 
        Israel and its neighbors.
            (4) The gas drilling sites represent strategic 
        infrastructure that are potential targets for terrorist 
        organizations, like Hezbollah and Hamas, seeking to cause harm 
        to Israel and its interests.
            (5) The discovery of large gas reserves in the exclusive 
        economic zone of Israel necessitates the deployment of new 
        naval capabilities of Israel to protect these resources.
            (6) Hezbollah reportedly possesses the Russian cruise 
        missile, Yakhont, which is capable of striking Israel's coast, 
        putting key Israeli infrastructure and economic assets within 
        range.
            (7) Hezbollah has previously deployed anti-ship missiles, 
        including during a 2006 attack on an Israeli naval vessel that 
        killed four Israeli sailors.
            (8) During Operation Protective Edge in 2014, Hamas claimed 
        responsibility for firing rockets at Israeli natural gas 
        installations 19 miles off the coast of Gaza.
            (9) United States-Israeli cooperation to combat Israel's 
        varied security threats has proven beneficial to both 
        countries.
            (10) The provision of United States assistance to Israel to 
        protect the coastline of Israel and natural gas fields located 
        in the exclusive economic zone of Israel will be critical to 
        enabling Israel to develop its energy infrastructure and 
        further integrate Israel into regional and European economies.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL TO PROTECT 
              THE COASTLINE OF ISRAEL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS LOCATED IN 
              THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE OF ISRAEL.

    (a) In General.--The President is authorized to provide assistance 
to Israel to protect the coastline of Israel and natural gas fields 
located in the exclusive economic zone of Israel.
    (b) Activities Supported.--Activities that may be supported by 
assistance under subsection (a) include the following:
            (1) Procurement, maintenance, and sustainment of the 
        David's Sling Weapon System for purposes of intercepting short-
        range missiles launched at the coastline of Israel and natural 
        gas fields described in subsection (a).
            (2) Payment of incremental expenses of Israel that are 
        incurred by Israel as the direct result of participation in a 
        bilateral or multilateral military exercise of the United 
        States Navy or Coast Guard, including pursuant to section 2010 
        of title 10, United States Code.
            (3) Conduct of increased visits of United States naval 
        vessels at ports of Israel.
            (4) Conduct of joint research and development for advanced 
        maritime domain awareness capabilities.
    (c) Sunset.--This section shall terminate on the date that is 5 
years after the date of the enactment of this Act.
