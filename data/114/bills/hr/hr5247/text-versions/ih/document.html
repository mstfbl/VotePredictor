        clean water;
            (2) to provide funding and support for long-term solutions 
        including water storage, desalination and recycling;
            (3) to protect threatened and endangered species; and
            (4) to facilitate the movement of water to communities most 
        in need while adhering to all environmental laws.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) California is experiencing one of the most severe 
        droughts on record, with the snowpack at the lowest levels in 
        500 years;
            (2) Governor Jerry Brown declared a drought state of 
        emergency on January 17, 2014, and subsequently imposed strict 
        water reductions on communities throughout the State;
            (3) the drought constitutes a serious emergency that poses 
        immediate and severe risks to--
                    (A) human health and safety;
                    (B) economic security; and
                    (C) the environment;
            (4) wells that provide households with clean water have 
        dried up due to 4 consecutive years of drought, with 
        approximately 2,591 domestic wells statewide identified as 
        critical or dry, affecting an estimated 12,955 residents, many 
        in the Central Valley;
            (5) rural and disadvantaged communities have been hardest 
        hit, placing great strain on drinking water supplies in the 
        Southern San Joaquin Valley--
                    (A) 69 communities in Southern San Joaquin Valley 
                have reported significant water supply and quality 
                issues; and
                    (B) East Porterville is particularly hard hit, with 
                40 percent, or 3,000, of its residents, without running 
                water;
            (6) the State of California's water supplies are at record-
        low levels, as indicated by the fact that major Central Valley 
        Project reservoir levels were anywhere from 30 percent to 79 
        percent of their historical average as of February 8, 2016;
            (7) while storage levels are below their historical 
        averages, snowpack is the deepest it's been since 2005, the 
        State of California's Department of Water Resources found in 
        its survey conducted on February 2, 2016, that the snow-water 
        equivalent (the amount of water in the snowpack) was 130 
        percent above the February average;
            (8) the drought has resulted in many lost jobs including 
        more than 21,000 seasonal and part-time agricultural jobs--
        resulting in a 10.9 percent unemployment rate in the Central 
        Valley, double the statewide unemployment rate of 5.7 percent, 
        as of December 15, 2015;
            (9) thousands of families have been affected, placing ever 
        greater demands on food banks and other relief organizations, 
        and as of December 21, 2015--
                    (A) the California Department of Social Services 
                Drought Food Assistance Program has provided more than 
                1,000,000 boxes to food banks in affected communities 
                with high levels of unemployment; and
                    (B) nearly 72 percent of the food distributions 
                have occurred in the Tulare Basin counties of Fresno, 
                Kern, Kings, and Tulare;
            (10) 2015 statewide economic costs are estimated at 
        $2,700,000,00, including but not limited to--
                    (A) the loss of $900,000,000 in crop revenue;
                    (B) the loss of $350,000,000 in dairy and other 
                livestock value; and
                    (C) an increase of $590,000,000 in ground water 
                pumping costs;
            (11) 1,032,508 acres in California's Central Valley were 
        fallowed in 2015, a 626,512 acre increase from 2011;
            (12) the drought is imperiling California's forests, which 
        provide important ecological, economic, and cultural benefits 
        to the State, and among the effects of the drought--
                    (A) loss of 50,000,000 large trees due to stress 
                from lack of water;
                    (B) 888,000,000 trees, covering 26,000,000 acres of 
                California forestland, experienced losses of canopy 
                cover since 2011, threatening ecosystem destruction and 
                loss of animal habitat; and
                    (C) 6,337 fires covering 307,598 acres occurred in 
                2015;
            (13) fish continue to be threatened by the extended 
        drought, compounding effects on two endangered species, further 
        reducing river flows and increasing water temperatures--
                    (A) Delta smelt abundance are at a historic low, as 
                evidenced by long-term monitoring surveys; and
                    (B) the abundance of the last remaining population 
                of wild Sacramento River winter run Chinook salmon 
                continue to decline, with mortality rates between 95 
                percent and 97 percent over the past 2 years, according 
                to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
            (14) wildlife has also been affected, with Level 2 water 
        deliveries to wildlife refuges under the Central Valley Project 
        Improvement Act reduced by 25 percent in the north-of-Delta 
        region and 35 percent in the south-of-Delta region, and 
        delivery schedules shortened to only the winter months, and--
                    (A) these reduced water supplies have contributed 
                to a decline of the Pacific Flyway, a migratory route 
                for waterfowl that spans from Alaska to South America;
                    (B) the reduction in water supplies has led to a 
                significant decline in flooded rice fields, a vital 
                habitat for migratory birds. Only one-third of the 
                usual acres of rice fields were flooded in 2015; and
                    (C) the reduction of available habitat for 
                migratory waterfowl contributed to a decreased food 
                availability in wildlife refuges and an increased risk 
                of disease due to overcrowding of birds;
            (15) subsidence in California is occurring at more than 12 
        inches per year, caused in part by an increase in ground water 
        pumping of more than 6,000,000 acre feet, some areas in the 
        Central Valley have sunk as much as 2 inches per month, and the 
        damage from subsidence is wide-ranging--
                    (A) roads, bridges, building foundations, 
                pipelines, canals, dams, and other infrastructure have 
                been damaged;
                    (B) vital aquifers have been depleted;
                    (C) vital levees have sustained cracks and 
                ruptures; and
                    (D) shallow aquifers have become vulnerable to 
                contamination as surface water infiltrates through 
                fissures in the soil;
            (16) the California Department of Water Resources 
        identified 21 ground water basins where excessive ground water 
        pumping has resulted in overdraft, 11 of which are in the San 
        Joaquin Valley;
            (17) California homes, cities, wildlife, businesses, and 
        farming need more water than is available today, particularly 
        in the San Joaquin Valley;
            (18) Congress recognizes that providing more water to those 
        who need it most will require science-based management of water 
        supplies and fish and wildlife resources, including--
                    (A) alternative management strategies, such as 
                removing nonnative species, enhancing habitat, 
                monitoring fish movement and location in real-time, and 
                improving water quality in the Delta, which could 
                contribute significantly to protecting and recovering 
                those endangered fish species, and at potentially lower 
                costs to water supplies than solely focusing on 
                restrictions on water exports; and
                    (B) updated science and improved monitoring tools 
                that provide Federal and State agencies with better 
                information about conditions and operations that may or 
                may not lead to high salvage events that jeopardize 
                fish populations; and
            (19) given the dire effects outlined above and the 
        potential for continued harm, this emergency requires--
                    (A) immediate and credible action that takes into 
                account the complexity and importance of the water 
                system to the State; and
                    (B) policies that do not position stakeholders 
                against one another, which in the past has led to 
                costly litigation that benefits no one and prevents any 
                real solutions.

 TITLE I--LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS FOR WESTERN STATES SUBJECT TO DROUGHT

        Subtitle A--Assistance for Drought-Stricken Communities

SEC. 101. ASSISTANCE FOR DROUGHT-STRICKEN COMMUNITIES AND WATERSMART 
              REAUTHORIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) across the United States, more than 90 percent of the 
        community water systems serve populations of less than 10,000 
        individuals;
            (2) the number of dry wells continues to increase as the 
        State of California entered the fourth consecutive summer of 
        drought, with approximately 2,591 wells statewide identified as 
        critical or dry, which affected an estimated 12,955 residents, 
        with 2,444 of the 2,502 of the dry wells concentrated in the 
        inland regions within the Central Valley;
            (3) many areas of the State of California are 
        disproportionately impacted by drought because the areas are 
        heavily dependent or completely reliant on ground water from 
        basins that are in overdraft and in which the water table

informed reservoir operations plan, the Secretary of the Army shall 
work closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
and may consider--
            (1) the relationship between ocean and atmospheric 
        conditions, including the El Nino and La Nina cycles, and the 
        potential for above-normal, normal, and below-normal rainfall 
        for the coming water year, including consideration of 
        atmospheric river forecasts;
            (2) the precipitation and runoff index specific to the 
        basin and watershed of the relevant dam or reservoir, including 
        incorporating knowledge of hydrological and meteorological 
        conditions that influence the timing and quantity of runoff;
            (3) improved hydrologic forecasting for precipitation, 
        snowpack, and soil moisture conditions;
            (4) an adjustment of operational flood control rule curves 
        to optimize water supply storage and reliability, hydropower 
        production, environmental benefits for flows and temperature, 
        and other authorized project benefits, without a reduction in 
        flood safety; and
            (5) proactive management in response to changes in 
        forecasts.
    (f) Funding.--
            (1) Definition of operational document.--In this

                a document described in any of subparagraphs (A) 
                through (F).
            (2) Acceptance and use.--The Secretary of the Army may 
        accept and expend amounts from non-Federal entities to fund all 
        or a portion of the cost of carrying out a review or revision 
        of operational documents for any reservoir that is either 
        operated or maintained by the Secretary, or for which the 
        Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations or otherwise 
        advise or consult concerning the use of storage allocated for 
        flood risk management or navigation.
    (g) Effect of Manual Revisions and Other Provisions.--
            (1) Manual revisions.--In accordance with all applicable

SEC. 114. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the record drought conditions being experienced in the 
        State of California as of the date of enactment of this Act 
        are--
                    (A) expected to recur in the future; and
                    (B) likely to do so with increasing frequency;
            (2) water storage is an indispensable and integral part of 
        any solution to address the long-term water challenges of the 
        State of California;
            (3) Congress has authorized relevant feasibility studies 
        for 5 water storage projects in the State of California, 
        including projects for--
                    (A) enlargement of Shasta Dam in Shasta County 
                under section 2(a) of Public Law 96-375 (94 Stat. 
                1506), as reaffirmed under section 103(d)(1)(A)(i)(I) 
                of Public Law 108-361 (118 Stat. 1684);
                    (B) enlargement of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in Contra 
                Costa County under section 215 of Public Law 108-7 (117 
                Stat. 147), as reaffirmed under section 
                103(d)(1)(A)(i)(II) of Public Law 108-361 (118 Stat. 
                1684);
                    (C) construction of North-of-Delta Offstream 
                Storage (Sites Reservoir) in Colusa County under 
                section 215 of Public Law 108-7 (117 Stat. 147), as 
                reaffirmed under section 103(d)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of Public 
                Law 108-361 (118 Stat. 1684);
                    (D) construction of the Upper San Joaquin River 
                storage (Temperance Flat) in Fresno and Madera Counties 
                under section 215 of Public Law 108-7 (117 Stat. 147), 
                as reaffirmed under section 103(d)(1)(A)(ii)(II) of 
                Public Law 108-361 (118 Stat. 1684); and
                    (E) expansion of San Luis Reservoir under section 
                103(f)(1)(A) of Public Law 108-361 (118 Stat. 1694);
            (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, more than 10 
        years have elapsed since the authorization of the feasibility 
        studies referred to in paragraph (3), but for a variety of 
        reasons the slow pace of work on completion of the feasibility 
        studies for those 5 water storage projects is unjustified and 
        of deep concern; and
            (5) there is significant public interest in, and urgency 
        with respect to, completing all feasibility studies and 
        environmental reviews for the water storage projects referred 
        to in paragraph (3), given the critical need for that 
        infrastructure to address current and future water challenges 
        of the State of California.

                    (B) are expected to participate in the cost pools 
                that will be created for the projects proposed in the 
                feasibility studies under this section.

SEC. 116. LOSSES CAUSED BY CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF WATER STORAGE 
              PROJECTS.

    The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other 
appropriate agencies, shall establish a process to address direct and 
substantial impacts caused by any storage projects identified under 
section 115.

 Subtitle C--Desalination, Water Reuse and Recycling, and Conservation

SEC. 121. WATER RECYCLING AND DESALINATION PROJECTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Federal funding to support water recycling and 
        desalination projects in recent years has been insufficient to 
        address water supply needs in many regions across the United 
        States;
            (2) climate variability and drought resiliency require 
        additional water supply projects to cope with higher 
        probabilities of longer, more intense droughts;
            (3) the historic drought in the State of California 
        highlights the necessity of long-term projects to address a 
        changing climate;
            (4) the California Water Plan and surveys conducted by the 
        National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the Water Reuse 
        Association, the Association of California Water Agencies, the 
        Western Recycled Water Coalition, and the California 
        Association of Sanitation Agencies led to the identification of 
        137 water recycling and desalination projects capable of 
        producing 1,412,799 acre-feet of new water supplies if 
        sufficient funding or financing tools existed to facilitate 
        development of the projects;
            (5) there exists a Federal interest in the projects 
        referred to in paragraph (4) to the extent that the projects 
        can--
                    (A) diversify water supplies;
                    (B) reduce conflicts hindering existing Federal 
                reclamation efforts on the Colorado River and around 
                the Delta; and
                    (C) advance technologies which reduce the cost and 
                improve the efficiency of water desalination projects; 
                and
            (6) this Act will enable Federal support for desalination 
        projects, including the projects referred to in paragraph (4) 
        and others by providing Federal cost-share grants, through the 
        Water Desalination Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 10301 note; Public 
        Law 104-298), the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study 
        and Facilities Act (43 U.S.C. 390h et seq.), and the WaterSMART 
        program of the Department of the Interior, and by making low-
        cost loans or loan guarantees available under subtitle D.
    (b) Water Recycling Projects.--On submission of a completed 
feasibility report in accordance with Bureau of Reclamation standards, 
the Secretary of the Interior shall review requests for water recycling 
project funding assistance and, subject to the availability of 
appropriations, award funding, on a competitive basis, for projects 
that meet the eligibility requirements of this title, subject to the

SEC. 201. ACTIONS TO BENEFIT ENDANGERED FISH POPULATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) minimizing or eliminating stressors to fish populations 
        and their habitat in an efficient and structured manner is a 
        key aspect of a fish recovery strategy;
            (2) functioning, diverse, and interconnected habitats are 
        necessary for a species to be viable; and
            (3) providing for increased fish habitat may not only allow 
        for a more robust fish recovery, but also reduce impacts to 
        water supplies.
    (b) Actions for Benefit of Endangered Species.--There is authorized 
to be appropriated the following amounts:
            (1) $35,000,000 for the Secretary of Commerce, through the 
        Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration, to carry out the following activities in 
        accordance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1531 et seq.):
                    (A) Gravel and rearing area additions and habitat 
                restoration to the Sacramento River to benefit Chinook 
                salmon and steelhead trout.

    TITLE III--CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY DROUGHT RELIEF AND OPERATIONAL 
                              FLEXIBILITY

SEC. 301. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCREASED REAL-TIME MONITORING AND 
              UPDATED SCIENCE.

    (a) Smelt Biological Opinion.--The Director shall use the best 
scientific and commercial data available to implement, continuously 
evaluate, and refine or amend, as appropriate, the reasonable and 
prudent alternative described in the smelt biological opinion.
    (b) Increased Monitoring To Inform Real-Time Operations.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
        conduct additional surveys, on an annual basis at the 
        appropriate time of year based on environmental conditions, in 
        collaboration with interested stakeholders regarding the 
        science of the Delta in general, and to enhance real-time 
        decisionmaking in particular, working in close coordination 
        with relevant State authorities.
            (2) Requirements.--In carrying out this subsection, the 
        Secretary of the Interior shall use--
                    (A) the most appropriate and accurate survey 
                methods available for the detection of Delta smelt to 
                determine the extent to which adult Delta smelt are 
                distributed in relation to certain levels of turbidity 
                or other environmental factors that may influence 
                salvage rate;
                    (B) results from appropriate surveys for the 
                detection of Delta smelt to determine how the Central 
                Valley Project and State Water Project may be operated 
                more efficiently to maximize fish and water supply 
                benefits; and
                    (C) science-based recommendations developed by any 
                of the persons or entities described in subsection 
                (d)(2) to inform the agencies' real-time decisions.
            (3) Winter monitoring.--During the period between December 
        1 and March 31, if suspended sediment loads enter the Delta 
        from the Sacramento River, and the suspended sediment loads 
        appear likely to raise turbidity levels in the Old River north 
        of the export pumps from values below 12 Nephelometric 
        Turbidity Units (NTUs) to values above 12 NTUs, the Secretary 
        of the Interior shall--
                    (A) conduct daily monitoring using appropriate 
                survey methods at locations including the vicinity of 
                Station 902 to determine the extent to which adult 
                Delta smelt are moving with turbidity toward the export 
                pumps; and
                    (B) use results from the monitoring under 
                subparagraph (A) to determine how increased trawling 
                can inform daily real-time Central Valley Project and 
                State Water Project operations to maximize fish and 
                water supply benefits.
    (c) Periodic Review of Monitoring.--Not later than 1 year after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall--
            (1) evaluate whether the monitoring program under 
        subsection (b), combined with other monitoring programs for the 
        Delta, is providing sufficient data to inform Central Valley 
        Project and State Water Project operations to maximize the 
        water supply for fish and water supply benefits; and
            (2) determine whether the monitoring efforts should be 
        changed in the short or long term to provide more useful data.
    (d) Delta Smelt Distribution Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than March 15, 2021, the 
        Secretary of the Interior shall--
                    (A) complete studies, to be initiated by not later 
                than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
                designed--
                            (i) to understand the location and 
                        determine the abundance and distribution of 
                        Delta smelt throughout the range of the Delta 
                        smelt; and
                            (ii) to determine potential methods to 
                        minimize the effects of Central Valley Project 
                        and State Water Project operations on the Delta 
                        smelt;
                    (B) based on the best available science, if 
                appropriate and practicable, implement new targeted 
                sampling and monitoring of Delta smelt in order to 
                maximize fish and water supply benefits prior to 
                completion of the study under subparagraph (A);
                    (C) to the maximum extent practicable, use new 
                technologies to allow for better tracking of Delta 
                smelt, such as acoustic tagging, optical recognition 
                during trawls, and fish detection using residual 
                deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); and
                    (D) if new sampling and monitoring is not 
                implemented under subparagraph (B), provide a detailed 
                explanation of the determination of the Secretary of 
                the Interior that no change is warranted.
            (2) Consultation.--In determining the scope of the studies 
        under this subsection, the Secretary of the Interior shall 
        consult with--
                    (A) Central Valley Project and State Water Project 
                water contractors and public water agencies;

                    (D) nongovernmental organizations.
    (e) Scientifically Supported Implementation of OMR Flow 
Requirements.--
            (1) Environmental protection mandate.--The Secretaries of 
        the Interior and Commerce shall take no action pursuant to this 
        Act that would cause additional adverse effects on the listed 
        fish species beyond the range of effects anticipated to occur 
        to the listed fish species for the duration of the applicable 
        biological opinion, using the best scientific and commercial 
        data available.
            (2) Real-time management to achieve multiple goals.--
        Building upon previous drought operations in calendar years 
        2014 and 2015, the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce 
        shall monitor in real time to determine the location and 
        densities of listed fish species relative to the pumps, Delta 
        conditions, and other relevant factors, in order to identify--
                    (A) opportunities to increase water pumping without 
                violating the standard in paragraph (1) or other 
                applicable environmental laws and regulations; and
                    (B) circumstances where it is necessary to decrease 
                water pumping to protect listed fish species.
            (3) Management.--In implementing the smelt biological 
        opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, the Secretaries of 
        the Interior and Commerce shall manage the OMR in accordance 
        with those opinions to maximize water supplies for the Central 
        Valley Project and State Water Project, to the extent 
        consistent with paragraph (1).
            (4) Reverse flow.--
                    (A) In general.--With respect to the management of 
                reverse flow in the OMR under the smelt biological 
                opinion, the Secretary of the Interior shall implement 
                the relevant provisions of the smelt biological opinion 
                to maximize Central Valley Project and State Water 
                Project water supplies, to the extent consistent with 
                paragraph (1).
                    (B) Requirements.--If the Secretary determines to 
                manage rates of pumping at the C.W. ``Bill'' Jones and 
                the Harvey O. Banks pumping plants in the southern 
                Delta to achieve a reverse OMR flow rate less negative 
                than -5,000 cubic feet per second, the Secretary 
                shall--
                            (i) document in writing any significant 
                        facts regarding real-time conditions relevant 
                        to the determinations of OMR reverse flow 
                        rates, including--

                                required by applicable Federal or State 
                                laws;
                                    (V) turbidity; and
                                    (VI) whether any alternative 
                                measures could have a substantially 
                                lesser water supply impact.
            (5) Immediate action.--Nothing in this section shall 
        prevent the Secretaries of the Interior or Commerce from taking 
        immediate action to reduce pumping if necessary to do so to 
        comply with the Endangered Species Act, its implementing 
        regulations, or to avoid additional adverse effects on the 
        listed fish species beyond the range of effects anticipated to 
        occur to the listed fish species for the duration of the 
        applicable biological opinion.
    (f) First Sediment Flush.--During the first flush of sediment out 
of the Delta in each water year, based on objective evidence and 
notwithstanding subsection (e), the Secretary of the Interior shall 
manage OMR flow pursuant to the portion of the smelt biological opinion 
that protects adult Delta smelt from the first flush if required to do 
so by the smelt biological opinion.
    (g) Construction.--The Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce 
may--
            (1) implement subsection (e) building on, and taking into

            (1) review, including seeking public comment regarding, 
        whether any revision to the method used to calculate reverse 
        flow in the OMR for implementation of the reasonable and 
        prudent alternatives in the smelt biological opinion and the 
        salmonid biological opinion for the purpose of using the best 
        available science and monitoring to maximize fish and water 
        supply benefits is warranted; and
            (2) implement the revised method to calculate reverse flow 
        in the OMR pursuant to paragraph (1).
    (i) Successor Biological Opinions.--The Secretaries of the Interior 
and Commerce shall apply the provisions of this Act to successor 
biological opinions to the salmonid biological opinion and the smelt 
biological opinion, to the extent that the Secretaries of the Interior 
and Commerce determine to be consistent with--
            (1) section 701(a)(3); and
            (2) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
        seq.) and the regulations implementing that Act.

            (1)(A) in close coordination with the California Department 
        of Water Resources and the California Department of Fish and 
        Wildlife, implement a pilot project to test and evaluate the 
        ability to operate the Delta cross-channel gates daily or as 
        otherwise may be appropriate to keep the gates open to the 
        maximum extent practicable to protect out-migrating salmonids, 
        manage salinities in the interior Delta and any other water 
        quality issues, and maximize Central Valley Project and State 
        Water Project pumping, subject to the condition that the pilot 
        project shall be designed and implemented consistent with 
        operational criteria and monitoring criteria required by the 
        California State Water Resources Control Board, including its

                under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
                1531 et seq.);
                    (B) water quality; and
                    (C) water supply benefits;
            (3) collaborate with the California Department of Water 
        Resources to install a deflection barrier at Georgiana Slough 
        and the Delta cross-channel gate to protect migrating 
        salmonids, consistent with knowledge gained from related 
        activities carried out during 2014 and 2015;
            (4) not later than May 15, 2016, submit to the Committees 
        on Energy and Natural Resources and Environment and Public 
        Works of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of 
        the House of Representatives a notice and explanation regarding 
        the extent to which the gates are able to remain open pursuant 
        to paragraphs (1) through (3);

        Delta smelt due consistent with the smelt biological opinion;
            (6) adopt a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for the increment of 
        increased flow, as measured as a 3-day running average at 
        Vernalis during the period beginning on April 1 and ending on 
        May 31, that results from the voluntary sale, transfer, or 
        exchange, unless the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce 
        determine in writing that the ratio will cause additional 
        adverse effects on any salmonid listed fish species beyond the 
        range of effects anticipated to occur to the listed fish 
        species for the duration of the salmonid biological opinion 
        using the best scientific and commercial data available and 
        subject to the condition that any individual sale, transfer, or 
        exchange using that ratio may only proceed if--
                    (A) the Secretary of the Interior determines that 
                the environmental effects of the proposed sale, 
                transfer, or exchange are consistent with effects 
                permitted under applicable law (including the 
                Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et 
                seq.), and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act 
                (California Water Code 13000 et seq.));
                    (B) Delta conditions are suitable to allow movement 
                of the acquired, transferred, or exchanged water 
                through the Delta, in accordance with existing Central 
                Valley Project and State Water Project permitted water 
                rights and the requirements of section 3405(a)(1)(H) of 
                the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (Public Law 
                102-575; 106 Stat. 4711); and
                    (C) the voluntary sale, transfer, or exchange of 
                water results in flow that is in addition to flow that 
                otherwise would occur in the absence of the voluntary 
                sale, transfer, or exchange;
            (7)(A) issue all necessary permit decisions under the 
        authority of the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce by 
        not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a completed 
        application by the State of California to place and use 
        temporary barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to 
        improve water quantity and quality for State Water Project and 
        Central Valley Project south-of-Delta water contractors and 
        other water users, which barriers or gates shall provide 
        benefits for species protection and in-Delta water user water 
        quality, subject to the condition that the barriers or gates 
        shall be designed so that, if practicable, formal consultations 
        under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
        U.S.C. 1536) are not necessary; or
            (B) take a longer period to issue the permit decisions 
        described in subparagraph (A) only if the Secretaries of the 
        Interior and Commerce determine in writing that an 
        environmental impact statement is needed for the proposal to 
        comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
        U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);
            (8) allow and facilitate, consistent with existing 
        priorities, water transfers through the C.W. ``Bill'' Jones 
        Pumping Plant or the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant during the 
        period beginning on April 1 and ending on November 30, subject 
        to the condition that the transfers--
                    (A) are consistent with applicable Federal and 
                State laws (including regulations), including the 
                California Environmental Quality Act (California Public 
                Resources Code 21000-21177); and
                    (B) are consistent with the smelt biological 
                opinion and the salmonid biological opinion;
            (9) require the Director and the Commissioner--

conditions, in order to identify--
            (1) opportunities to increase water pumping without 
        violating the standard in subsection (a) or other environmental 
        laws and regulations; and
            (2) circumstances where it is necessary to decrease water 
        pumping to protect listed fish species.
    (c) Requirement.--When consistent with the environmental protection 
mandate in subsection (a) and other environmental protections under 
subsection (f), the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce, through 
the drought contingency plans, shall evaluate and may authorize the 
Central Valley Project and the State Water Project, combined, to 
operate at levels that result in daily average OMR flows more negative 
than -5,000 cubic feet per second (based on United States Geological 
Survey gauges on OMR) to capture peak flows during storm-related 
events, in accordance with subsections (d), (e), and (f).
    (d) Factors To Be Considered.--In determining additional adverse 
effects on any listed fish species beyond the range of effects 
anticipated to occur to the listed fish species for the duration of the 
smelt biological opinion or salmonid biological opinion, using the best 
scientific and commercial data available, the Secretaries of the 
Interior and Commerce may consider the following factors:
            (1) The real-time distribution of listed species.
            (2) Relevant physical parameters including projected 
        inflows, turbidity, salinities, and tidal cycles.

    (e) Other Environmental Protections.--
            (1) State law.--The actions of the Secretaries of the 
        Interior and Commerce pursuant to this section shall be 
        consistent with applicable regulatory requirements under State 
        law.
            (2) First sediment flush.--During the first flush of 
        sediment out of the Delta during each water year, based on 
        objective evidence and notwithstanding the other provisions of 
        this subsection, the Secretary of the Interior shall manage OMR 
        flow pursuant to the portion of the smelt biological opinion 
        that protects adult Delta smelt from the first flush if 
        required to do so by the smelt biological opinion.
            (3) Applicability.--
                    (A) In general.--This section on capturing peak 
                flows from winter storms shall not affect the 
                application of the salmonid biological opinion during 
                the period beginning on April 1 and ending on May 31, 
                unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that this 
                section can be applied during part or all of that time 
                period to provide emergency water supply relief without 
                resulting in additional adverse effects beyond those 
                anticipated to occur for the duration the salmonid 
                biological opinion.
                    (B) Through-Delta water transfers.--In addition to 
                any other actions to benefit water supply, the 
                Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce shall consider 
                allowing through-Delta water transfers to occur during 
                the period referred to in subparagraph (A), in 
                accordance with section 302(b)(8).
            (4) Monitoring.--In implementing this section, the 
        Commissioner, in coordination with the Director, the Assistant 
        Administrator, and the California Department of Fish and 
        Wildlife, shall carry out a monitoring program and other data 
        gathering activities--
                    (A) to ensure incidental take levels are not 
                exceeded; and
                    (B) to identify potential negative impacts, if any.
    (f) Effect of High Outflows.--When exercising their authorities 
pursuant to drought contingency plans to capture peak flows pursuant to 
subsection (c), the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce shall not 
count any day during that period toward the 5-day or 14-day running 
averages of tidally filtered daily OMR flow requirements under the 
smelt biological opinion or the salmonid biological opinion unless 
doing so is required to avoid additional adverse effects on listed fish 
species beyond the range of effects anticipated to occur to the listed 
fish species for the duration of the biological opinions, using the 
best scientific and commercial data available.

            (2) Identification of projects.--
                    (A) Sequencing.--
                            (i) In general.--The Secretary shall

                        on the final deauthorization list according to 
                        the order in which the Reclamation projects and 
                        separable elements were authorized, beginning 
                        with the earliest-authorized Reclamation

                        Reclamation program, project, or separable 
                        element is critical for interests of the United 
                        States, based on the possible impact of the 
                        Reclamation program, project, or separable 
                        element on--

                        project, and separable element of a Reclamation 
                        program or project on the interim 
                        deauthorization list developed under subsection 
                        (c) that is not included on the final 
                        deauthorization list; and
                            (ii) describes the reasons why the 
                        Reclamation program, project, or separable 
                        element is not included.

                appendix under paragraph (2)(B) to the Committee on 
                Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the 
                Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
                Representatives; and
                    (B) publish the final deauthorization list and the

    (e) Deauthorization; Congressional Review.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), effective 
        beginning on the date that is 180 days after the date of 
        submission of the final deauthorization list under subsection 
        (d), a Reclamation program, project, or separable element of a 
        Reclamation program or project included on the list is 
        deauthorized, unless Congress passes a joint resolution 
        disapproving the final deauthorization report before that date.
            (2) Non-federal contributions.--A Reclamation program, 
        project, or separable element included on the final 
        deauthorization list under subsection (d) shall not be 
        deauthorized under this subsection if, before the expiration of 
        the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (1), the non-
        Federal interest of the Reclamation program, project, or 
        separable element provides sufficient funds to complete the 
        Reclamation program, project, or separable element.
    (f) Treatment of Project Modifications.--For purposes of this 
section, if an authorized water resources development Reclamation 
program, project, or separable element of the program or project has 
been modified by an Act of Congress, the date of authorization of the 
Reclamation program, project, or separable element shall be deemed to 
be the date of the most recent modification.
    (g) Exemption.--Any Reclamation project that would yield an average 
of more than 200,000 acre-feet of water per year shall be exempt from 
this subsection.
