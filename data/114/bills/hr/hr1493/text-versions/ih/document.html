                                 A BILL


 
To protect and preserve international cultural property at risk due to 
 political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect and Preserve International 
Cultural Property Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITION.

    In this Act:
            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.
            (2) Cultural property.--The term ``cultural property'' 
        includes property covered under--
                    (A) the Hague Convention for the Protection of 
                Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, 
                concluded at The Hague on May 14, 1954 (Treaty Doc. 
                106-1(A));
                    (B) Article 1 of the Convention Concerning the 
                Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural 
                Heritage, adopted by UNESCO on November 23, 1972 
                (commonly referred to as the ``1972 Convention''); or
                    (C) Article 1 of the Convention on the Means of 
                Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, 
                and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, adopted 
                by UNESCO on November 14, 1970 (commonly referred to as 
                the ``1970 UNESCO Convention'').

SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over the years, international cultural property has 
        been looted, trafficked, lost, damaged, or destroyed due to 
        political instability, armed conflict, natural disasters, and 
        other threats.
            (2) During China's Cultural Revolution, many antiques were 
        destroyed, including a large portion of old Beijing, and 
        Chinese authorities are now attempting to rebuild portions of 
        China's lost architectural heritage.
            (3) In 1975, the Khmer Rouge, after seizing power in 
        Cambodia, systematically destroyed mosques and nearly every 
        Catholic church in the country, along with many Buddhist 
        temples, statues, and Buddhist literature.
            (4) In 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, 
        ancient statues carved into a cliffside in central Afghanistan, 
        leading to worldwide condemnation.
            (5) After the fall of Saddam Hussein, thieves looted the 
        Iraq Museum in Baghdad, resulting in the loss of approximately 
        15,000 items, including ancient amulets, sculptures, ivories, 
        and cylinder seals. Many of these items remain unrecovered.
            (6) The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami not only 
        affected 11 countries, causing massive loss of life, but also 
        damaged or destroyed libraries, archives, and World Heritage 
        Sites such as the Mahabalipuram in India, the Sun Temple of 
        Koranak on the Bay of Bengal, and the Old Town of Galle and its 
        fortifications in Sri Lanka.
            (7) In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, artifacts, 
        and archives, and partially destroyed the 17th century Haitian 
        city of Jacmel.
            (8) In Mali, the Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Ansar 
        Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in the ancient city of 
        Timbuktu--a major center for trade, scholarship, and Islam in 
        the 15th and 16th centuries--and threatened collections of 
        ancient manuscripts.
            (9) In Egypt, recent political instability has led to the 
        ransacking of museums, resulting in the destruction of 
        countless ancient artifacts that will forever leave gaps in 
        humanity's record of the ancient Egyptian civilization.
            (10) In Syria, the ongoing civil war has resulted in the 
        shelling of medieval cities, damage to five World Heritage 
        Sites, and the looting of museums containing artifacts that 
        date back more than six millennia and include some of the 
        earliest examples of writing.
            (11) In Iraq and Syria, the militant group ISIL has 
        destroyed numerous cultural sites and artifacts, such as the 
        Tomb of Jonah in July 2014, in an effort to eradicate ethnic 
        and religious minorities from contested territories. 
        Concurrently, cultural antiquities that escape demolition are 
        looted and trafficked to help fund ISIL's militant operations.
            (12) On February 12, 2015, the United Nations Security 
        Council unanimously adopted resolution 2199 (2015), which 
        ``[r]eaffirms its decision in paragraph 7 of resolution 1483 
        (2003) and decides that all Member States shall take 
        appropriate steps to prevent the trade in Iraqi and Syrian 
        cultural property and other items of archaeological, 
        historical, cultural, rare scientific, and religious importance 
        illegally removed from Iraq since 6 August 1990 and from Syria 
        since 15 March 2011, including by prohibiting cross-border 
        trade in such items, thereby allowing for their eventual safe 
        return to the Iraqi and Syrian people.''.
            (13) United Nations Security Council resolution 2199 (2015) 
        also warns that ISIL and other extremist groups are trafficking 
        cultural heritage items from Iraq and Syria to fund their 
        recruitment efforts and carry out terrorist attacks.
            (14) Cultural property represents an irreparable loss of 
        humanity's common cultural heritage and is therefore a loss for 
        all Americans.
            (15) Protecting international cultural property is a vital 
        part of United States cultural diplomacy, showing the respect 
        of the United States for other cultures and the common heritage 
        of humanity.
            (16) The United States Armed Forces have played important 
        roles in preserving and protecting cultural property. In 1943, 
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt established a commission to 
        advise the United States military on the protection of cultural 
        property. The commission formed teams of individuals known as 
        the ``Monuments Men'' who are credited with securing, 
        cataloguing, and returning hundreds of thousands of works of 
        art stolen by the Nazis during World War II.
            (17) The Department of State, in response to the Convention 
        on Cultural Property Implementation Act, noted that ``the 
        legislation is important to our foreign relations, including 
        our international cultural relations. The expanding worldwide 
        trade in objects of archaeological and ethnological interest 
        has led to wholesale depredations in some countries, resulting 
        in the mutilation of ceremonial centers and archaeological 
        complexes of ancient civilizations and the removal of stone 
        sculptures and reliefs.''. The Department further noted that 
        ``[t]he United States considers that on grounds of principle, 
        good foreign relations, and concern for the preservation of the 
        cultural heritage of mankind, it should render assistance in 
        these situations.''.
            (18) The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in 
        2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague Convention 
        for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
        Conflict and to coordinate with the United States military, 
        other branches of the United States Government, and other 
        cultural heritage nongovernmental organizations in preserving 
        international cultural property threatened by political 
        instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) protect and preserve international cultural property at 
        risk of looting, trafficking, and destruction due to political 
        instability, armed conflict, or natural or other disasters;
            (2) protect international cultural property pursuant to its 
        obligations under international treaties to which the United 
        States is a party;
            (3) prevent, in accordance with existing laws, importation 
        of cultural property pillaged, looted, stolen, or trafficked at 
        all times, including during political instability, armed 
        conflict, or natural or other disasters; and
            (4) ensure that existing laws and regulations, including 
        import restrictions imposed through the Office of Foreign Asset 
        Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, are fully 
        implemented to prevent trafficking in stolen or looted cultural 
        property.
