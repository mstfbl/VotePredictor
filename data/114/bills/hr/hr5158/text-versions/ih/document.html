        of 1986, the Additional Social Security Account Fund shall be 
        treated as a trust described in section 401(a) of such Code 
        which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such 
        Code, and any distribution from the Fund under the Additional 
        Social Security Account program shall be treated in the same 
        manner as a distribution from such a trust.
            (2) No distributions during first 10 years of fund.--No 
        distributions may be made from the Fund earlier than 10 years 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act.

        Social Security Account.
    (f) Investment of Fund.--The Secretary shall appoint a Board, which

options.

beneficiaries (under such rules as the Secretary shall prescribe) to
