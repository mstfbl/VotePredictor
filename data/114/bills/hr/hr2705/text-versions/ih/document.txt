                        bodies of water that form geographical features 
                        commonly known as streams, oceans, rivers, and 
                        lakes that are connected to waters that are 
                        navigable-in-fact.
                    ``(B) Exclusions.--The term `navigable waters' does 
                not include--
                            ``(i) waters that do not physically abut 
                        waters described in subparagraph (A) through an

                            ``(ii) man-made or natural structures or 
                        channels through which water flows 
                        intermittently or ephemerally, including for 
                        the periodic drainage of rainfall; or
                            ``(iii) wetlands, including playa lakes, 
                        prairie potholes, wet meadows, wet prairies, 
                        and vernal pools, that lack a continuous 
                        surface water connection to bodies of water 
                        that are waters described in subparagraph (A).
                    ``(C) No aggregation.--The aggregation of wetlands 
                or waters shall not be used to determine whether the 
                wetlands or waters are navigable waters.''.

United States for such purposes.
