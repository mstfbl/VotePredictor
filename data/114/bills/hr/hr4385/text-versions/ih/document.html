    (a) Program Authorized.--
            (1) Grants authorized.--From amounts appropriated under 
        subsection (f), the Secretary of Education (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Secretary'') shall award grants, from 
        allotments under subsection (b), to States having applications 
        approved under subsection (d), to enable the States to 
        eliminate tuition and required fees at public institutions of 
        higher education.
            (2) Matching funds requirement.--Each State that receives a 
        grant under this section shall provide matching funds for a 
        fiscal year in an amount that is equal to one half the amount 
        received under this section for the fiscal year toward the cost 
        of reducing the cost of attendance at public institutions of 
        higher education in the State.
    (b) Determination of Allotment.--
            (1) Initial allotment.--For fiscal year 2017, the Secretary 
        shall allot to each eligible State that submits an application 
        under this section an amount that is equal to 67 percent of the 
        total revenue received by the State's public system of higher 
        education in the form of tuition and related fees for fiscal 
        year 2017. For each of fiscal years 2018 through 2020, the 
        Secretary shall allot to each eligible State that submits an 
        application under this section--
                    (A) an amount equal to the allotment the State 
                received for fiscal year 2017, plus
                    (B) if the State provides additional funds toward 
                the cost of reducing the cost of attendance at public 
                institutions of higher education in the State for any 
                of such fiscal years that is more than the matching 
                funds requirement under subsection (a)(2), an amount 
                equal to such additional funding provided by the State, 
                which amount provided by the Secretary may be used for 
                the activities described in subsection (e)(2).
            (2) Subsequent allotments.--Beginning in fiscal year 2021, 
        the Secretary shall determine the median allotment per full-
        time equivalent student made to all eligible States under this 
        section for fiscal year 2020 and incrementally reduce 
        allotments made to States under this section such that by 
        fiscal year 2026, no State receives an allotment under this

        median allotment per full-time equivalent student made under 
        this section for fiscal year 2020.
    (c) State Eligibility Requirements.--In order to be eligible to 
receive an allotment under this section for a fiscal year, a State

        institutions of higher education, excluding the amount of funds

        2016;
            (4) maintain State expenditures on need-based financial aid 
        programs for enrollment in public institutions of higher 
        education in the State at a level that meets or exceeds the 
        level of such support for fiscal year 2016;
            (5) ensure public institutions of higher education in the 
        State maintain funding for institutional need-based student 
        financial aid in an amount that is equal to or exceeds the

SEC. 401. FAFSA PILOT PROGRAM.

    Part G of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1088 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 483 the following:

``SEC. 483A. FAFSA PILOT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            ``(1) to streamline the annual process by which students 
        apply for Federal financial assistance;
            ``(2) to reduce the need for students to reapply for such 
        assistance each year;
            ``(3) to lower the cost of student borrowing by maintaining 
        important student loan protections, such as the in-school 
        interest subsidy;
            ``(4) to strengthen the middle class and reduce income 
        inequality by targeting financial aid to low- and middle-income 
        students; and
            ``(5) to ensure that the financial aid application uses 
        income data from prior tax years readily available to students 
        and families to facilitate the widespread and increased use of 
        automated processes, such as at the IRS-Data Retrieval Tool 
        (IRS-DRT), with the goal of reducing errors and easing the time 
        and rigor of the application process.
    ``(b) Pilot Program Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized to 
establish a pilot program and select 5 eligible States--
            ``(1) in which a student who attends an institution of 
        higher education in the eligible State may submit a single Free 
        Application for Federal Student Aid, as described in section 
        483 and modified under subsection (d) (referred to in this 
        section as the `FAFSA'), to be used as the application to 
        determine the need and eligibility of the student for financial 
        assistance under this title during the official length of the 
        student's proposed postsecondary degree program; and
            ``(2) that shall each receive a grant in accordance with 
        subsection (e).
    ``(c) Eligible States.--The Secretary shall select 5 eligible 
States that are determined by the Secretary to have a strong record of 
increasing college access and affordability, especially for low-income 
students, to participate in the pilot program described in subsection 
(b). The selection of eligible States shall be based on the extent to 
which the State has--
            ``(1) invested, and continues to invest, significantly in 
        public higher education, resulting in a comparatively lower net 
        price for low-income students;
            ``(2) allocated State financial aid primarily on the basis 
        of need; and
            ``(3) agreed, as a condition of the State's application for 
        the pilot program under this section, to provide all in-State 
        students (as determined by the State) with an offer for State 
        financial aid that--
                    ``(A) is valid for not less than 2 years and not 
                more than 4 years, as determined by the State; and
                    ``(B) shall be subject to change only upon certain 
                conditions, such as significant changes in a student's 
                financial circumstances.
    ``(d) Single FAFSA Submission.--The Secretary shall implement, in 
consultation with the 5 selected eligible States, a pilot program to 
streamline the process of application to determine the need and 
eligibility of a student for financial assistance under this title that 
incorporates the following:
            ``(1) An option for students that are enrolled in an 
        institution of higher education in a selected eligible State to 
        submit a single FAFSA at the beginning of the student's 
        postsecondary degree program and receive a determination of 
        financial assistance under this title that shall, on a 
        contingent basis, be valid for not less than 2 years and not 
        more than 4 years, as determined by the State.
            ``(2) The determination of financial assistance under 
        paragraph (1) shall be made in accordance with part F, except 
        that relevant calculations shall be made using a multi-year 
        average, of 2 or 3 years, from the most recent tax years for 
        which data are available. A student may use previously 
        submitted student and parent taxpayer data to prepopulate the 
        electronic version of the FAFSA, as described in section 
        483(f).
            ``(3) As a condition of the continued receipt of financial 
        assistance under this section, the Secretary may require a 
        student who submits the single FAFSA to respond to a short 
        number of questions (which may be determined by the Secretary), 
        on an annual basis, to determine if there is a change in the 
        financial status of the student (such as whether the student or 
        the student's parent has experienced a substantial increase in 
        annual income) in order to ensure that the student continues to 
        receive the appropriate amount of financial assistance under 
        this title.
            ``(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a requirement that 
        students who experience significant changes in their financial 
        circumstances, as determined by the Secretary, will be required 
        to resubmit the FAFSA in order to receive a new determination 
        of financial assistance under this title.
            ``(5) An income verification process--
                    ``(A) which the Secretary, through the 
                establishment of a memorandum of understanding with the 
                Secretary of the Treasury, will develop to share the 
                income tax data of a random sample of students who have 
                received Federal assistance under this title, including 
                Federal Pell Grants under section 401 and loans made 
                under part D;
                    ``(B) to ensure that students who have not 
                resubmitted a FAFSA in accordance with paragraph (3) 
                did not have a significant change in financial 
                circumstances that would have required them to do so;
                    ``(C) that shall be carried out in a way so as to 
                ensure that no personally identifiable information is 
                made public through the income verification process; 
                and
                    ``(D) that will be carried out only with the 
                consent of students, whose consent will be requested as 
                part of the annual response required under paragraph 
                (3).
            ``(6) An option for students to request professional 
        judgment or resubmit their FAFSA each year, to receive a new 
        determination of eligibility for financial assistance under 
        this title.
    ``(e) Grant Amount.--Each eligible State selected under this 
section shall receive a grant to increase public awareness of, and 
promote the use of, the single FAFSA that may be submitted under the 
pilot program to be used as the application to determine the need and 
eligibility of the student for financial assistance under this title 
during the official length of the student's proposed postsecondary 
degree program.
    ``(f) Supplement Not Supplant.--Grants provided under this section 
shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, State funds that are 
used to improve college access and affordability.
    ``(g) Evaluation.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
enactment of the College for All Act, and 5 years thereafter, the 
Secretary shall prepare and submit to the authorizing committees a 
report that contains an evaluation of the effectiveness of the pilot 
program under this section in improving college access, increasing 
FAFSA submission rates, and increasing postsecondary education credit 
and course accumulation.''.

SEC. 402. PRIOR, PRIOR YEAR.

    Section 480(a)(1) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1087vv(a)(1)) is amended by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the 
following:
    ``(B) Notwithstanding section 478(a) and beginning not later than 
180 days after the date of enactment of the College for All Act, the 
Secretary shall provide for the use of data from the second preceding 
tax year when and to the extent necessary to carry out the 
simplification of applications (including simplification for a subset 
of applications) used for the estimation and determination of financial 
aid eligibility. Such simplification shall include the sharing of data 
between the Internal Revenue Service and the Department, pursuant to 
the consent of the taxpayer.''.
