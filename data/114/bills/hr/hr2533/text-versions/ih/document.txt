    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. LOCAL GUARD CONTRACTS ABROAD UNDER DIPLOMATIC SECURITY 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Section 136(c)(3) of the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (22 U.S.C. 4864(c)(3)) is 
amended to read as follows:
            ``(3) in evaluating proposals for such contracts, award 
        contracts to technically acceptable firms offering the lowest 
        evaluated price, except that--
                    ``(A) the Secretary may award contracts on the 
                basis of best value (as determined by a cost-technical 
                tradeoff analysis); and
                    ``(B) proposals received from United States persons 
                and qualified United States joint venture persons shall 
                be evaluated by reducing the bid price by 10 
                percent;''.
    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report that 
includes--
            (1) an explanation of the implementation of paragraph (3) 
        of section 136(c) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
        Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, as amended by subsection (a) of 
        this section; and
            (2) for each instance in which an award is made pursuant to 
        subparagraph (A) of such paragraph (3), as so amended, a 
        written justification and approval, providing the basis for 
        such award and an explanation of the inability to satisfy the 
        needs of the Department of State by technically acceptable, 
        lowest price evaluation award.
                                 <all>
