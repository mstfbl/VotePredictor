    Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended by adding at the 
end the following new section:

            ``post-acute care (pac) payment bundling system

    ``Sec. 1899C.  (a) Establishment of System.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a 
        retrospective bundled payment arrangement (in this section 
        referred to as the `PAC bundled payment system') under which, 
        in accordance with the provisions of this section, actual 
        payments made under this title to post-acute care providers 
        with respect to post-acute care services furnished to targeted 
        beneficiaries during a bundle period are adjusted (through 
        additional payment or recoupment, as applicable), based on a 
        benchmark established by the Secretary for such bundle.
            ``(2) Implementation.--The PAC bundled payment system shall 
        be established to be applied to services furnished in fiscal 
        years beginning with fiscal year 2020.
    ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) PAC beneficiary.--The term `targeted beneficiary' 
        means an individual who is entitled to benefits under part A 
        and enrolled under part B and not enrolled under part C.
            ``(2) Post-acute care services.--The term `post-acute care 
        services' means post-acute care, including home health 
        services, skilled nursing services, inpatient rehabilitation 
        services, and inpatient hospital services, for which payment 
        may otherwise be made under this title and which are furnished 
        during a bundle period to a targeted beneficiary.
            ``(3) Post-acute care provider.--The terms `post-acute care 
        provider' means each of the following:
                    ``(A) A home health agency.
                    ``(B) A skilled nursing facility.
                    ``(C) A rehabilitation facility.
                    ``(D) A long-term care hospital.
            ``(4) Bundle period.--The term `bundle period' means, with 
        respect to a bundle of post-acute care services for a targeted 
        beneficiary who was discharged from an inpatient hospital stay, 
        a period beginning on the first date on which post-acute care 
        services within a bundle specified under subsection (c) is 
        furnished to an individual not later than 30 days after such 
        discharge and ending 30, 60, or 90 days, as specified by the 
        Secretary for such bundle, after such first date.
    ``(c) Bundles.--The Secretary shall establish under the PAC bundled 
payment system bundles of post-acute care services consisting of MS-
DRGs, other than such MS-DRGs included under the Comprehensive Care for 
Joint Replacement Model carried out by the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services under section 1115A, that represent the highest 50 
percent of expenditures under this title attributable to post acute 
care, and shall periodically update such bundles, based on the most 
recent available data.
    ``(d) Payment Methodology.--The PAC payment system shall be 
designed consistent with the following:
            ``(1) Payment or recoupment based off of benchmark.--The 
        Secretary shall annually establish a payment benchmark for each 
        bundle of post-acute care services specified under subsection 
        (c) for such year. The Secretary shall, through annual 
        reconciliation, adjust the payments made to a post-acute care 
        provider with respect to post-acute care services included 
        within a bundle so specified furnished to a targeted 
        beneficiary during a bundle period during the year so that 
        total payments for such provider with respect to such services 
        within such bundle furnished to such beneficiary during such 
        period equals such benchmark for such bundle.
            ``(2) Considerations.--In establishing the payment amount 
        for a bundle of post-acute care services, the Secretary may 
        consider patient characteristics and other factors that are 
        designed to take into account variations in treatment costs 
        within the bundle.
            ``(3) Savings.--The payment rates established for such 
        bundles shall be set to result in, in the aggregate, a 
        reduction in the spending otherwise made under parts A and B 
        for post-acute care services included in such bundles of 2.85 
        percent by not later than fiscal year 2025.
            ``(4) Annual updates.--The payment rates for bundles of 
        post-acute care services shall be updated each fiscal year 
        based on a market basket of the services included within such 
        bundles.
            ``(5) Coverage of 50 percent of total payments.--The 
        bundles under this section, collectively, shall be established 
        by the Secretary so as to provide for payment for at least 50 
        percent of all post-acute care services provided under this 
        title during each fiscal year under the PAC bundled payment 
        system.''.

        damages'' means objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred 
        as a result of the provision of, use of, or payment for (or

        loss of employment, and loss of business or employment 
        opportunities.
            (7) Health care lawsuit.--The term ``health care lawsuit''

            (10) Health care organization.--The term ``health care 
        organization'' means any person or entity which is obligated to

SEC. 322. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.

    The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 
years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the 
claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 
have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall 
the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after 
the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the 
following--
            (1) upon proof of fraud;
            (2) intentional concealment; or
            (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
        therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of 
        the injured person.
Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of 
the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor 
under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of 
manifestation of injury or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever 
provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for 
minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health 
care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or 
collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured 
minor.

SEC. 323. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.

    (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in 
Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this 
subtitle shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full amount of the 
available economic damages.
    (b) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 
be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 
for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 
the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 
liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 
rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 
party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 
the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.

SEC. 324. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.

    (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to 
Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the 
arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of 
interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages 
awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any 
health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a 
financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court 
shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage 
recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant 
based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no 
event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all 
claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:
            (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the 
        claimant(s).
            (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 
        recovered by the claimant(s).
            (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by 
        the claimant(s).
            (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by 
        the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.
    (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall apply 
whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, 
arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a 
health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court 
retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court 
supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only 
in civil actions.

SEC. 325. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS.

    In any health care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death, any 
party may introduce evidence of collateral source benefits. If a party 
elects to introduce such evidence, any opposing party may introduce 
evidence of any amount paid or contributed or reasonably likely to be 
paid or contributed in the future by or on behalf of the opposing party 
to secure the right to such collateral source benefits. No provider of 
collateral source benefits shall recover any amount against the 
claimant or receive any lien or credit against the claimant's recovery 
or be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the claimant in a 
health care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death. This section 
shall apply to any health care lawsuit that is settled as well as a 
health care lawsuit that is resolved by a fact finder. This section 
shall not apply to section 1862(b) (42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)) or section 
1902(a)(25) (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)) of the Social Security Act.

SEC. 326. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    (a) Vaccine Injury.--
            (1) To the extent that title XXI of the Public Health 
        Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a 
        civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death--
                    (A) this subtitle does not affect the application 
                of the rule of law to such an action; and
                    (B) any rule of law prescribed by this subtitle in 
                conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not 
                apply to such action.
            (2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a 
        vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law 
        under title XXI of the Public Health Service Act does not 
        apply, then this subtitle or otherwise applicable law (as 
        determined under this subtitle) will apply to such aspect of 
        such action.
    (b) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, nothing 
in this subtitle shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a 
defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other provision 
of Federal law.

SEC. 327. STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.

    (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health care 
lawsuits set forth in this subtitle preempt, subject to subsections (b) 
and (c), State law to the extent that State law prevents the 
application of any provisions of law established by or under this 
subtitle. The provisions governing health care lawsuits set forth in 
this subtitle supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, to 
the extent that such chapter--
            (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent 
        fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be 
        commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic 
        payment of future damages, than provided in this subtitle; or
            (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding 
        collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits subrogation 
        or a lien on collateral source benefits.
    (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--(1) Any issue 
that is not governed by any provision of law established by or under 
this subtitle (including State standards of negligence) shall be 
governed by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.
    (2) This subtitle shall not preempt or supersede any State or 
Federal law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections 
for health care providers and health care organizations from liability, 
loss, or damages than those provided by this subtitle or create a cause 
of action.
    (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this subtitle shall be 
construed to preempt--
            (1) any State law (whether effective before, on, or after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies a 
        particular monetary amount of compensatory or punitive damages 
        (or the total amount of damages) that may be awarded in a 
        health care lawsuit, regardless of whether such monetary amount 
        is greater or lesser than is provided for under this subtitle, 
        notwithstanding section 4(a); or
            (2) any defense available to a party in a health care 
        lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

SEC. 328. STATE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS TO EVALUATE ALTERNATIVES TO

                    (C) Dissemination.--The Secretary shall broadly

        lawsuit, no punitive damages may be awarded against a health

preventing a State from--

        compliance with a guideline issued under subsection (a); or

        in addition to, but not in lieu of, the guidelines issued under

        the month of December 2016 and thereafter, any such increase 
        for the period for which the percentage change is determined

        determined under applicable law, the increase determined under 
        such applicable law by substituting the Chained CPI for the 
        CPI.
            (2) Increases determined from a constant base year.--
                    (A) In general.--In any case in which the amount of 
                a cost-of-living increase effective in the month of

                a period which is determined by reference to a base 
                period which remains constant from year to year, any 
                such increase for any period shall be deemed to be, in 
                lieu of the increase otherwise determined under 
                applicable law, the increase, expressed as a percentage 
                increase, equal to the product of--
                            (i) the CPI fraction prior to 2017; 
                        multiplied by
                            (ii) the Chained CPI fraction after 2016,
                reduced by 1.
                    (B) CPI fraction prior to 2017.--The CPI fraction 
                prior to 2017 is the fraction--
                            (i) the numerator of which is the CPI for 
                        the period, ending with or during 2015, which 
                        corresponds to the base period; and
                            (ii) the denominator of which is the CPI 
                        for the base period.
                    (C) Chained cpi fraction after 2016.--The Chained 
                CPI fraction after 2016 is the fraction--
                            (i) the numerator of which is the Chained 
                        CPI for the period, ending with or during the 
                        year preceding the year in which the 
                        determination takes effect, which corresponds 
                        to the base period; and
                            (ii) the denominator of which is the most 
                        recently published estimate of the Chained CPI 
                        for the period, ending with or during 2015, 
                        which corresponds to the base period.
