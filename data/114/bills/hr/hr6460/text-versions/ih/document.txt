 funded through a State drinking water treatment revolving loan fund, 
  the use of iron and steel products that are produced in the United

    This Act may be cited as the ``Buy America for Drinking Water

SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF AMERICAN MATERIALS.

    Section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-12) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(s) Requirements for Use of American Materials.--
            ``(1) In general.--Funds made available from a State 
        drinking water treatment revolving loan fund established under 
        this section may not be used for a project for the 
        construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of collection, 
        treatment, storage, and distribution facilities, including 
        publicly and privately owned pipes or other constructed 
        conveyances, unless all of the iron and steel products used in 
        the project are produced in the United States.
            ``(2) Definition of iron and steel products.--In this 
        section, the term `iron and steel products' means the following 
        products made primarily of iron or steel: Lined or unlined 
        pipes and fittings, manhole covers and other municipal 
        castings, hydrants, tanks, flanges, pipe clamps and restraints, 
        valves, structural steel, reinforced precast concrete, and 
        construction materials.
            ``(3) Application.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any 
        case or category of cases in which the Administrator finds 
        that--
                    ``(A) applying paragraph (1) would be inconsistent 
                with the public interest;
                    ``(B) iron and steel products are not produced in 
                the United States in sufficient and reasonably 
                available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or
                    ``(C) inclusion of iron and steel products produced 
                in the United States will increase the cost of the 
                overall project by more than 25 percent.
            ``(4) Waiver.--If the Administrator receives a request for 
        a waiver under this section, the Administrator shall--
                    ``(A) make available to the public, on an informal 
                basis, a copy of the request and information available 
                to the Administrator concerning the request;
                    ``(B) make the request and accompanying information 
                available by electronic means, including on the 
                official public Internet site of the Environmental 
                Protection Agency; and
                    ``(C) allow for informal public input on the 
                request for at least 15 days prior to making a finding 
                based on the request.
            ``(5) International agreements.--This section shall be 
        applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations 
        under international agreements.
            ``(6) Management and oversight.--The Administrator may 
        retain up to 0.25 percent of the funds appropriated for this 
        section for management and oversight of the requirements of 
        this subsection.
            ``(7) No effect on other requirements.--The requirement in 
        paragraph (1) is in addition to any other applicable 
        requirements for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or 
        repair of facilities using iron and steel products that are 
        produced in the United States.
            ``(8) Effective date.--This subsection does not apply with 
        respect to a project if a State agency approves the engineering 
        plans and specifications for the project, in that agency's 
        capacity to approve such plans and specifications prior to a 
        project requesting bids, prior to October 1, 2018.''.
