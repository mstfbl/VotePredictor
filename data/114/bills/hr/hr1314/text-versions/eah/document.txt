        carrying out the program described in paragraph (2)(B), to the

            (2) Program to modernize the strategic petroleum reserve.--
                    (A) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                            (i) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is one 
                        of the Nation's most valuable energy security 
                        assets.
                            (ii) The age and condition of the Strategic 
                        Petroleum Reserve have diminished its value as 
                        a Federal energy security asset.
                            (iii) Global oil markets and the location 
                        and amount of United States oil production and 
                        refining capacity have dramatically changed in 
                        the 40 years since the establishment of the 
                        Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
                            (iv) Maximizing the energy security value 
                        of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve requires a 
                        modernized infrastructure that meets the 
                        drawdown and distribution needs of changed 
                        domestic and international oil and refining 
                        market conditions.
                    (B) Program.--The Secretary of Energy shall 
                establish a Strategic Petroleum Reserve modernization 
                program to protect the United States economy from the 
                impacts of emergency product supply disruptions. The 
                program may include--
                            (i) operational improvements to extend the 
                        useful life of surface and subsurface 
                        infrastructure;
                            (ii) maintenance of cavern storage 
                        integrity; and
                            (iii) addition of infrastructure and 
                        facilities to optimize the drawdown and 
                        incremental distribution capacity of the 
                        Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated (and drawdowns and sales under subsection (c) in an equal 
amount are authorized) for carrying out subsection (d)(2)(B), 
$2,000,000,000 for the period encompassing fiscal years 2017 through 
2020.
    (f) Transmission of Department Budget Requests.--The Secretary of 
Energy shall prepare and submit in the Department's annual budget 
request to Congress--
            (1) an itemization of the amounts of funds necessary to 
        carry out subsection (d); and
            (2) a designation of any activities thereunder for which a 
        multiyear budget authority would be appropriate.
    (g) Sunset.--The authority of the Secretary to draw down and sell 
crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under this section shall 
expire at the end of fiscal year 2020.

SEC. 846. EXPEDITED EXAMINATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Office of Personnel Management shall, upon request of the Commissioner 
of Social Security, expeditiously administer a sufficient number of 
competitive examinations, as determined by the Commissioner, for the

times requested by the Commissioner, but not later than December 31, 
2022. Such examinations shall proceed even if one or more individuals

one or more of such appeals have not concluded, provided that--
            (1) the Commissioner of Social Security has made a 
        determination that delaying the examination poses a significant 
        risk that an adequate number of Administrative Law Judges will 
        not be available to meet the need of the Social Security 
        Administration to reduce or prevent a backlog of cases awaiting 
        a hearing;
            (2) an individual whose appeal is pending is provided an 
        option to continue their appeal or elects to take the new 
        examination, in which case the appeal is considered vacated;

            (3) an individual who decides to continue his or her appeal 
        and who ultimately prevails in the appeal shall receive 
        expeditious consideration for hire by the Office Personnel 
        Management and the Commissioner of Social Security.
    (b) Payment of Costs.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
the Commissioner of Social Security shall pay the full cost associated 
with each examination conducted pursuant to subsection (a).

        additional amounts determined under this paragraph are the

        be determined--

        is filed, the amount of the imputed underpayment (as of the 
        date of the filing of the petition) if the partnership

filed in accordance with this section shall have jurisdiction to 
determine all items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the 
partnership for the partnership taxable year to which the notice of 
final partnership adjustment relates, the proper allocation of such 
items among the partners, and the applicability of any penalty, 
addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership may be 
liable under this subchapter.
    ``(d) Determination of Court Reviewable.--Any determination by a 
court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision

the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. 
The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date 
of the court's order entering the decision.
    ``(e) Effect of Decision Dismissing Action.--If an action brought 
under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission 
under section 6231(c), the decision of the court dismissing the action 
shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final 
partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be 
entered in the records of the court.
