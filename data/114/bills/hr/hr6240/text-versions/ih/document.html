   To accelerate reductions in climate pollution in order to leave a 
   better planet for future generations, and to create a bipartisan 
 commission to develop economically viable policies to achieve science-
                   based emissions reduction targets.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Solutions Commission Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) there has been a marked increase in extreme weather 
        events and the negative impacts of a changing climate are 
        expected to worsen in every region of the United States;
            (2) if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing 
        climate have the potential to adversely impact the health of 
        all Americans, harm the economy, and impose substantial costs 
        on State and Federal budgets;
            (3) efforts to reduce climate risk should protect our 
        Nation's economy, security, infrastructure, agriculture, water 
        supply, and public safety; and
            (4) there is bipartisan support for pursuing efforts to 
        reduce greenhouse gas emissions through economically viable, 
        broadly supported private and public policies and solutions.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.

    Effective immediately upon the enactment of this Act, there shall 
be established a bipartisan commission to be known as the ``National

        emissions to the President, Congress, and the States; and
            (3) use as its goals for emissions reductions those
