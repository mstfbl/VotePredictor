        U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be--
                    ``(A) the applicable wage rate in effect for each 
                industry and classification as of September 29, 2015; 
                and
                    ``(B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser 
                amount as may be necessary to equal the minimum wage 
                under section 6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning on 
                December 31, 2016, and on December 31 of every third 
                year thereafter, until the minimum wage applicable to 
                American Samoa under this paragraph is equal to the 
                minimum wage set forth in such section.''.
    (b) GAO Reports.--Section 8104 of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 
(29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--

                ``April 1, 2017''; and
                    (B) by striking the second sentence and inserting 
                the following: ``The Government Accountability Office 
                shall submit a subsequent report not later than April 
                1, 2020.'';
            (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the study under 
        subsection (a)'' and inserting ``any report under subsection 
        (a)''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Report on Alternative Methods of Increasing the Minimum Wage 
in American Samoa.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this subsection, the Government Accountability Office shall transmit 
to Congress a report on alternative ways of increasing the minimum wage 
in American Samoa to keep pace with the cost of living in American 
Samoa and to eventually equal the minimum wage set forth in section 
6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
206(a)(1)).''.

            Passed the House of Representatives September 28, 2015.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
