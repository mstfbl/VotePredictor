                enter into agreements under subsection (c), the 
                Administrator shall order the deployment of at least 
                one law enforcement officer authorized to carry 
                firearms within 300 feet of each airport security 
                screening location and within the terminal during 
                operating hours at each airport at which the number of 
                annual enplanements for the most recent calendar year

                the number of international enplanements is 1 million 
                or more. The Administrator shall order the deployment 
                of additional law enforcement officers authorized to 
                carry firearms at such airports if the Administrator 
                determines that such additional deployment is necessary 
                to ensure airport security.
                    ``(B) Waiver.--The Administrator may waive the 
                application of all or part of the requirements of 
                subparagraph (A) only if the relevant law enforcement 
                agency with jurisdiction over an airport described in 
                such subparagraph certifies in a written application to 
                the Administrator that adherence to all or part of such 
                requirements would--
                            ``(i) make provision of adequate security 
                        for such airport impossible; and
                            ``(ii) cause extreme hardship to such law 
                        enforcement agency that would severely impair

                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraph:
