                notwithstanding that the juvenile is such an inmate.''; 
                and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(mm) Juvenile; Eligible Juvenile; Public Institution.--For 
purposes of subsection (a)(82) and this subsection:
            ``(1) Juvenile.--The term `juvenile' means an individual 
        who is--
                    ``(A) under 19 years of age (or such higher age as 
                the State has elected under section 475(8)(B)(iii)); or
                    ``(B) is described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IX).
            ``(2) Eligible juvenile.--The term `eligible juvenile' 
        means a juvenile who is an inmate of a public institution and 
        was eligible for medical assistance under the State plan 
        immediately before becoming an inmate of such a public 
        institution or who becomes eligible for such medical assistance 
        while an inmate of a public institution.
            ``(3) Inmate of a public institution.--The term `inmate of 
        a public institution' has the meaning given such term for 
        purposes of applying the subdivision (A) following paragraph 
        (29) of section 1905(a), taking into account the exception in 
        such subdivision for a patient of a medical institution.''.
    (b) No Change in Exclusion From Medical Assistance for Inmates of 
Public Institutions.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
changing the exclusion from medical assistance under the subdivision 
(A) following paragraph (29) of section 1905(a) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)), including any applicable restrictions on a 
State submitting claims for Federal financial participation under title 
XIX of such Act for such assistance.
    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply to eligibility of

        the date that is 1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
            (2) Rule for changes requiring state legislation.--In the 
        case of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of 
        the Social Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services determines requires State legislation (other than 
        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by 
        subsection (a), the State plan shall not be regarded as failing 
        to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the 
        basis of its failure to meet these additional requirements 
        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
        after the close of the first regular session of the State 
        legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a 
        State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such 
        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the 
        State legislature.
