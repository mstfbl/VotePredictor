                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create incentives 
 for healthcare providers to promote quality healthcare outcomes, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hospital Outcomes 
Act of 2016''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Payment penalties for hospital acquired conditions 
        under section 1886(p) of the Social Security Act, as added by 
        section 3008 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
        are based on a limited number of hospital acquired conditions 
        but are applied to all Medicare inpatient prospective payments 
        to a hospital (as defined in section 1886(d) of the Social 
        Security Act), resulting in payment penalties that are not 
        proportional to the financial impact of the hospital acquired 
        conditions. The method of risk adjustment used to determine the 
        hospital acquired conditions performance of hospitals does not 
        adequately account for the chronic illness burden and severity 
        of illness of Medicare beneficiaries.
            (2) Payment penalties for hospital readmissions under 
        section 1886(q) of the Social Security Act, as added by section 
        3025 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, are 
        based on a limited number of clinical conditions, including 
        readmissions that are not related to the prior discharge and 
        are not proportional to the overall financial impact of the 
        readmission performance of the hospital. The method of risk 
        adjustment used to determine the readmission performance of 
        hospitals does not adequately account for the chronic illness 
        burden and severity of illness of Medicare beneficiaries.
            (3) The payment penalties for hospital acquired conditions 
        and readmission should be restructured to be based on a 
        comprehensive and clinically credible definition of 
        potentially-avoidable complications and potentially-avoidable 
        readmissions, be based on the risk adjusted rate of occurrence 
        potentially-avoidable complications and potentially-avoidable 
        readmissions and include both payment penalties and bonuses 
        that are proportional to the actual financial impact of 
        potentially-avoidable complications and potentially-avoidable 
        readmissions.
            (4) The existing methods of risk adjustment used to 
        determine the quality of care performance of hospitals should 
        be restructured and replaced by a methodology that is composed 
        of exhaustive and mutually exclusive risk categories that are 
        clinically credible and explicitly recognize the severity of 
        illness and chronic illness burden of Medicare beneficiaries, 
        thereby accounting for patient characteristics that may impact 
        access to care.

SEC. 2. HOSPITAL OUTCOMES.

    (a) Payment Adjustments for Hospital Outcomes.--Section 1886 of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsection:
    ``(t) Hospital Outcomes.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of an applicable hospital 
        for an applicable prospective period beginning on or after

                subsection (o) and any adjustment under paragraph (7) 
                of such subsection to the base operating DRG payment 
                amount (as defined in paragraph (7)(D) of such 
                subsection) that would otherwise apply to such hospital 
                during such period without application of this 
                subsection, such operating DRG payment amount shall be 
                adjusted by the potentially-avoidable outcome 
                adjustment factor described in paragraph (2) for the 
                hospital for such period; and
                    ``(B) the potentially-avoidable outcome adjustment 
                factor shall apply only with respect to the applicable 
                prospective period, and the Secretary shall not take 
                into account such adjustment factor in making payments 
                to hospitals under this section in a subsequent 
                applicable prospective period.
            ``(2) Potentially-avoidable outcome adjustment factor.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), 
                the potentially-avoidable outcome adjustment factor

                for an applicable prospective period, subject to 
                subparagraph (B), is equal to 1.0 minus the 
                potentially-avoidable outcome performance fraction 
                determined under paragraph (3) for the hospital and 
                period.
                    ``(B) Hospital-specific cap and floor.--In no 
                circumstance may the potentially-avoidable outcome 
                adjustment factor for an applicable hospital for an 
                applicable prospective period under subparagraph (A) 
                be--
                            ``(i) for applicable prospective periods 
                        occurring in fiscal years 2018 through 2020, 
                        less than 0.97 or more than 1.03; and
                            ``(ii) for applicable prospective periods 
                        occurring in or after fiscal year 2021, less

                for an applicable prospective period, subject to 
                subparagraph (C), is equal to the ratio of--
