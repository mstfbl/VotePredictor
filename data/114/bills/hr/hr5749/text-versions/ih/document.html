    (c) Directive to United States Sentencing Commission.--
            (1) In general.--Pursuant to its authority under section 
        994(p) of title 28, United States Code, and in accordance with 
        this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall 
        review and amend its guidelines and its policy statements 
        applicable to persons convicted of an offense defined in 
        chapter 124 added to title 18, United States Code, by this Act, 
        to ensure that the guidelines and policy statements are 
        consistent with those amendments and reflect the intent of 
        Congress that the guidelines reflect the seriousness and great 
        harm caused by those offenses.
            (2) Considerations.--In carrying out this section, the 
        United States Sentencing Commission shall consider--
                    (A) the mandate of the United States Sentencing 
                Commission, pursuant to its authority under section 
                994(p) of title 28, United States Code, to promulgate 
                guidelines that meet the purposes of sentencing as set 
                forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18, and in 
                particular to ensure that sentencing courts properly 
                consider the seriousness of the offense, to promote 
                respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the 
                offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal 
                conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes 
                of the defendant; and
                    (B) the intent of Congress that the penalties for 
                defendants convicted of an offense under that chapter 
                are appropriately severe and account for the nature of 
                the visual depiction, the acts engaged in, and the 
                potential harm resulting from the offense; the number 
                and age of the victims involved; and the degree to 
                which the victims have been harmed.
