            (13) Through the years, Mercy Ships has had four hospital

        world. Those include:
                    (A) The 16,500-ton Africa Mercy is the world's 
                largest nongovernmental hospital ship and is dedicated 
                to the continent of Africa.
                    (B) The 522-foot Anastasis was the flag ship, and 
                completed her first relief mission in 1982 to 
                Guatemala. Her crew of 400 worked in Africa until she 
                was decommissioned in 2007.
                    (C) Acquired in 1994, the 265-foot Caribbean Mercy 
                with her crew of 150 focused on the Caribbean basin and 
                Central America with its Eye Surgery Unit. The ship was 
                sold in 2006.
                    (D) Donated in 1983, the 172-foot Good Samaritan 
                served the Caribbean, Central and South America for 11 
                years with a crew of 60. Renamed the Island Mercy, she 
                was redeployed to the South Pacific in 1994 and served 
                there until sold in 2001.
                    (E) Mercy Ships is currently building a new 
                hospital ship to serve Africa's most needy for the next 
                50 years with delivery expected in 2018. The new 
                vessel, larger than the Africa Mercy, will assume the 
                title of world's largest private hospital ship with 
                increased capacity building and a focus on healthcare 
                training. It will also further the commitment of Mercy 
                Ships to provide and promote through teaching, safe 
                surgery globally as demonstrated by their membership in 
                the G4 Alliance.
            (14) Mercy Ships has hosted Presidents and other heads of 
        state from many nations around the world onboard their hospital 
        ships who commended the free health care provided to their 
        people.
            (15) Mercy Ships has been endorsed by President Nelson 
        Mandela, President George Bush, Desmund Tutu, President Ellen 
        Johnson Sirleaf, Sir John Major, President Dr. Ernest Bai 
        Koroma, Tony Blair, President Jimmy Carter and First Lady Mary
