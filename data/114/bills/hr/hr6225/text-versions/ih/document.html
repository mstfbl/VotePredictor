                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Federal Reserve Act to require Federal Reserve banks to 
 interview at least one individual reflective of gender diversity and 
one individual reflective of racial or ethnic diversity when appointing 
        Federal Reserve bank presidents, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Diverse Leadership at the 
Federal Reserve Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) while significant progress has occurred due to the 
        antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, 
        barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for candidates 
        reflective of gender diversity and racial or ethnic diversity 
        for Federal Reserve bank president positions in the Federal 
        Reserve System;
            (2) the continuing barriers described in paragraph (1) 
        merit the following amendment;
            (3) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of the historical lack of gender, racial, and 
        ethnic diversity from numerous sources, including congressional 
        hearings, scientific reports, reports issued by public and 
        private agencies, news stories, and reports of related barriers 
        by organizations and individuals, which show that 
        race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
        insufficient to address the problem;
            (4) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph 
        (3) demonstrate that barriers across the United States prove 
        problematic for full and fair participation in developing 
        monetary policy by individuals reflective of gender diversity 
        and racial or ethnic diversity; and
            (5) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph 
        (3) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for 
        the below amendment to address the historical lack of gender, 
        racial, and ethnic diversity in the Federal Reserve regional 
        bank presidents selection process in the Federal Reserve 
        System.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENTS.

    The provision designated ``fifth'' of the fourth undesignated 
paragraph of section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 341) is 
amended by inserting after ``employees.'' the following: ``In making 
the appointment of a president, the bank shall interview at least one 
individual reflective of gender diversity and one individual reflective 
of racial or ethnic diversity.''.
