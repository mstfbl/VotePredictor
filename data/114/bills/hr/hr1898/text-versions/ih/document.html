                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 101. FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The predominant driver of gross domestic product growth 
        over the past half century has been scientific and 
        technological advancement.
            (2) Investments in research and development have also 
        delivered significant benefits for national security, health, 
        energy security, education, and the personal well-being of all 
        Americans.
            (3) Virtually every new technological product is traceable 
        to a research discovery, often one pursued with no application 
        in mind.
            (4) Nondefense Federal research and development accounts 
        for only 1.7 percent of the Federal budget. Federal basic 
        research accounts for only 1 percent of the budget.
            (5) There is a deficit between what America is investing 
        and what it should be investing to remain competitive, not only 
        in research but in technology transfer, innovation, and job 
        creation, thereby causing America's highly successful science 
        and technology enterprise to atrophy.
            (6) Many research and development initiatives, due to the 
        long time periods required to achieve completion, have 
        benefited from stable and predictable investments and from 
        multiyear financial planning.
            (7) The Federal science agencies should receive sustained 
        and steady growth in funding for research and development 
        activities, including basic research, across a wide range of 
        disciplines, including physical, geological, and life sciences, 
        mathematics, engineering, and social, behavioral, and economic 
        sciences.

SEC. 102. NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL AMENDMENTS.

    Section 401 of the National Science and Technology Policy, 
Organization, and Priorities Act of 1977 (42 U.S.C. 6651) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``Federal Coordinating 
        Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology'' and 
        inserting ``National Science and Technology Council'';

        and Development Administration'' and inserting ``Department of 
        Energy, and any other agency designated by the President''; and
            (3) in subsection (e)--
                    (A) by striking ``engineering, and technology'' and 
                inserting ``engineering, technology, innovation, and 
                STEM education'';
                    (B) in paragraph (1), by striking ``engineering, 
                and technological'' and inserting ``engineering, 
                technological, innovation, and STEM education'';
                    (C) by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4) as 
                paragraphs (4) and (5), respectively; and
                    (D) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following 
                new paragraph:
            ``(3) address research needs identified under paragraph (2) 
        through appropriate funding mechanisms, which may include 
        solicitations involving 2 or more agencies and public-private 
        partnerships;''.

SEC. 103. REVIEW OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Establishment.--The Director of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy shall establish or designate a working group under 
the National Science and Technology Council with the responsibility of 
reviewing Federal regulatory and reporting requirements across Federal 
agencies that affect the conduct of United States research in an effort 
to reduce regulatory burdens and to eliminate and harmonize duplicative 
regulatory and reporting requirements.
    (b) Responsibilities.--The working group established or designated 
under subsection (a) shall--
            (1) periodically review all Federal regulations and 
        reporting requirements that affect the conduct of United States 
        research to--
                    (A) identify ways to harmonize overlapping or 
                duplicative research regulations and reporting 
                requirements across Federal agencies;
                    (B) evaluate such regulations and reporting 
                requirements in relationship to the risks the 
                requirements seek to address to determine if the 
                benefits of the requirements are commensurate with the 
                costs to the progress of science or to the taxpayer;
                    (C) identify any regulations that are applied to 
                scientific researchers or to research-performing 
                institutions for which exemptions could be reasonably 
                applied or for which adjustments could be made to 
                better fit those regulations to diverse research 
                environments; and
                    (D) identify any specific regulations which could 
                be refocused on performance-based goals rather than on 
                process while still meeting the desired outcome;
            (2) examine the extent to which agencies' guidance 
        documents adhere with the most recently updated version of the 
        Office of Management and Budget's Agency Good Guidance 
        Practices bulletin; and
            (3) develop and update at least once every 3 years a 
        strategic plan for streamlining Federal regulations and 
        reporting requirements that affect the conduct of United States 
        research that contains, at a minimum--
                    (A) a priority list of research-related 
                regulations, reporting requirements, and agency 
                guidance to be harmonized, streamlined, updated, or 
                eliminated; and
                    (B) a plan, including a timeline, for implementing 
                the regulatory and reporting reforms identified in 
                subparagraph (A).
    (c) Stakeholder Input.--In carrying out the responsibilities under 
subsection (b), including the development of the strategic plan under 
subsection (b)(3), the working group established or designated under 
subsection (a) shall take into account input and recommendations from 
non-Federal stakeholders, including federally funded and nonfederally 
funded researchers, institutions of higher education, scientific 
disciplinary societies and associations, nonprofit research 
institutions, industry, including small businesses, federally funded 
research and development centers, and others with a stake in ensuring 
effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability in the performance of 
scientific research.
    (d) Responsibilities of OSTP.--The Director of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy, in collaboration with the Office of 
Management and Budget Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
shall encourage and monitor the efforts of the participating agencies 
to ensure that the strategic plan is developed under subsection (b)(3) 
and that appropriate steps are taken by the agencies to effectively 
implement the recommendations, achieve the objectives, and to adhere to 
the timeline in the strategic plan.
    (e) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy 
shall transmit the priority list and strategic plan developed under 
subsection (b)(3) to the Congress. The Director shall further provide a 
report annually to the Congress, to be submitted not later than 60 days 
after the submission of the President's annual budget request, on the 
progress toward implementation of the regulatory reforms outlined in 
the strategic plan.

            (1) Cooperative research and development activities, 
        including collaboration between domestic and international 
        government, industry, and academic science and engineering 
        organizations, are important to promoting innovation and 
        knowledge creation.
            (2) Scientific and technical conferences and trade events 
        support the sharing of information, processes, and data within 
        the scientific and engineering communities.
            (3) In hosting and attending scientific and technical 
        conferences and trade events, Federal agencies--
                    (A) gain greater access to top researchers and to 
                new and potentially transformative ideas;
                    (B) keep abreast of developments relevant to their 
                respective missions, as is relevant for future program 
                planning;
                    (C) help disseminate Federal research results;
                    (D) provide opportunities both for employee 
                professional development and for recruiting new 
                employees;
                    (E) participate in scientific peer review; and

SEC. 118. DEFINITIONS.

    In this subtitle, terms that are defined in section 10 of the 21st 
Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act (15 U.S.C. 7509) 
have the meaning given those terms in that section.

                    Subtitle C--Engineering Biology

SEC. 121. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Engineering Biology Research 
and Development Act of 2015''.

SEC. 122. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cellular and molecular processes may be used, mimicked, 
        or redesigned to develop new products, processes, and systems 
        that improve societal well-being, strengthen national security, 
        and contribute to the economy.
            (2) Engineering biology relies on scientists and engineers 
        with a diverse and unique set of skills combining the 
        biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering.
            (3) Long-term research and development is necessary to 
        create breakthroughs in engineering biology. Such research and 
        development requires government investment as the benefits are 
        too distant or uncertain for industry to support alone.
            (4) The Federal Government can play an important role by 
        facilitating the development of tools and technologies to 
        further advance engineering biology, including multiple user 
        facilities that the Federal Government is uniquely able to 
        support.
            (5) Since other countries are investing significant 
        resources in engineering biology, the United States is at risk 
        of losing its competitive lead in this emerging area if it does 
        not invest the necessary resources and have a national 
        strategy.
            (6) A National Engineering Biology Initiative can serve to 
        establish new research directions and technology goals, improve 
        interagency coordination and planning processes, drive 
        technology transfer, and help ensure optimal returns on the 
        Federal investment.

                 TITLE II--STEM EDUCATION AND DIVERSITY

                Subtitle A--STEM Education and Workforce

SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the National Science and 
Technology Council's Committee on STEM Education (CoSTEM), established 
under section 101 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 
(42 U.S.C. 6621), has taken important initial steps toward developing 
and implementing a strategic plan for Federal investments in STEM 
education, but that more work must be done to solicit and take into 
account views and experience from stakeholders who help implement or 
are the beneficiaries of Federal STEM programs across the Nation. It is 
further the sense of Congress that science mission agencies such as the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Energy are essential 
partners in contributing to the goals and implementation of a Federal 
STEM strategic plan because such agencies have unique scientific and 
technological facilities as well as highly trained scientists who are 
eager and able to contribute to improved STEM learning outcomes in 
their own communities.

SEC. 204. NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT ON STEAM EDUCATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
        (STEM) Talent Expansion Program set an important goal of 
        increasing the number of students graduating with associate or 
        baccalaureate degrees in the STEM fields, and this should 
        continue to be a focus of that program;
            (2) to further the goal of the STEM Talent Expansion 
        Program, as well as STEM education promotion programs across 
        the Federal Government, innovative approaches are needed to 
        enhance STEM education in the United States;
            (3) STEAM, which is the integration of arts and design, 
        broadly defined, into Federal STEM programming, research, and 
        innovation activities, is a method-validated approach to 
        maintaining the competitiveness of the United States in both 
        workforce and innovation and to increasing and broadening 
        students' engagement in the STEM fields;
            (4) STEM graduates need more than technical skills to 
        thrive in the 21st century workforce; they also need to be 
        creative, innovative, collaborative, and able to think 
        critically;
            (5) STEAM should be recognized as providing value to STEM 
        research and education programs across Federal agencies, 
        without supplanting the focus on the traditional STEM 
        disciplines;
            (6) Federal agencies should work cooperatively on 
        interdisciplinary initiatives to support the integration of 
        arts and design into STEM, and current interdisciplinary 
        programs should be strengthened;
            (7) Federal agencies should allow for STEAM activities 
        under current and future grant-making and other activities; and
            (8) Federal agencies should clarify that, where 
        appropriate, data collection, surveys, and reporting on STEM 
        activities and grant-making should examine activities that 
        involve cross-disciplinary learning that integrates specialized 
        skills and expertise from both art and science.
    (b) National Research Council Workshop.--The National Science 
Foundation shall enter into an arrangement with the National Research 
Council to conduct a workshop on the integration of arts and design 
with STEM education. The workshop shall include a discussion of--
            (1) how the perspectives and experience of artists and 
        designers may contribute to the advancement of science, 
        engineering, and innovation, for example through the 
        development of visualization aids for large experimental and 
        computational data sets;
            (2) how arts and design-based education experiences might 
        support formal and informal STEM education at the pre-K-12 
        level, particularly in fostering creativity and risk taking, 
        and encourage more students to pursue STEM studies, including 
        students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM;
            (3) how the teaching of design principles can be better 
        integrated into undergraduate engineering and other STEM 
        curricula, including in the first two years of undergraduate 
        studies, to enhance student capacity for creativity and 
        innovation and improve student retention, including students 
        from groups historically underrepresented in STEM; and
            (4) what additional steps, if any, Federal science agencies 
        should take to promote the inclusion of arts and design 
        principles in their respective STEM programs and activities in 
        order to improve student STEM learning outcomes, increase the 
        recruitment and retention of students into STEM studies and 
        careers, and increase innovation in the United States.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the National Research Council shall submit a report to 
Congress providing a summary description of the discussion and findings 
from the workshop required under subsection (b).

SEC. 302. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR ALL FIELDS OF 
              SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the Foundation's investments in 
social, behavioral, and economic research have addressed challenges, 
including--
            (1) in medicine, matching organ donors to patients, leading 
        to a dramatic growth in paired kidney transplants;
            (2) in policing, implementing predictive models that help 
        to yield significant reductions in crime;
            (3) in resource allocation, developing the theories 
        underlying the Federal Communications Commission spectrum 
        auction, which has generated over $60,000,000,000 in revenue;
            (4) in disaster preparation and recovery, identifying 
        barriers to effective disaster evacuation strategies;
            (5) in national defense, assisting United States troops in 
        cross-cultural communication and in identifying threats; and
            (6) in areas such as economics, education, cybersecurity, 
        transportation, and national defense, supporting informed 
        decisionmaking in foreign and domestic policy.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in order 
to achieve its mission ``to promote the progress of science; to advance 
the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national 
defense'' the Foundation must continue to support unfettered, 
competitive, merit-reviewed basic research across all fields of science 
and engineering, including the social, behavioral, and economic 
sciences.

SEC. 303. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION MERIT REVIEW.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Foundation's Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts 
        criteria remain appropriate for evaluating grant proposals, as 
        concluded by the 2011 National Science Board Task Force on 
        Merit Review;
            (2) evaluating proposals on the basis of the Foundation's 
        Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts criteria ensures that--
                    (A) proposals funded by the Foundation are of high 
                quality and advance scientific knowledge; and
                    (B) the Foundation's overall funding portfolio 
                addresses societal needs through research findings or 
                through related activities; and
            (3) as evidenced by the Foundation's contributions to 
        scientific advancement, economic development, human health, and
