SEC. 135. LIMITATIONS ON STATE RESTRICTIONS ON EMPLOYER AUTO-
              ENROLLMENT.

    (a) In General.--No State shall establish a law that prevents an 
employer that is allowed an exclusion from gross income, a deduction, 
or a credit for Federal income tax purposes for health benefits 
furnished to a participant or beneficiary from instituting auto-
enrollment which meets the requirements of subsection (b) for coverage 
of a participant or beneficiary under a group health plan, or health 
insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan, so long as 
the participant or beneficiary has the option of declining such 
coverage.
    (b) Automatic Enrollment for Employer-Sponsored Health Benefits.--
            (1) In general.--The requirement of this subsection with 
        respect to an employer and an employee is that the employer 
        automatically enroll such employee into the employment-based 
        health benefits plan for individual coverage under the plan 
        option with the lowest applicable employee premium.
            (2) Opt-out.--In no case may an employer automatically 
        enroll an employee in a plan under paragraph (1) if such 
        employee makes an affirmative election to opt-out of such plan 
        or to elect coverage under an employment-based health benefits 
        plan offered by such employer. An employer shall provide an 
        employee with a 30-day period to make such an affirmative 
        election before the employer may automatically enroll the 
        employee in such a plan.
            (3) Notice requirements.--
                    (A) In general.--Each employer described in 
                paragraph (1) who automatically enrolls an employee 
                into a plan as described in such paragraph shall 
                provide the employees, within a reasonable period 
                before the beginning of each plan year (or, in the case 
                of new employees, within a reasonable period before the 
                end of the enrollment period for such a new employee), 
                written notice of the employees' rights and obligations 
                relating to the automatic enrollment requirement under 
                such paragraph. Such notice must be comprehensive and 
                understood by the average employee to whom the 
                automatic enrollment requirement applies.
                    (B) Inclusion of specific information.--The written 
                notice under subparagraph (A) must explain an 
                employee's right to opt out of being automatically 
                enrolled in a plan and in the case that more than one 
                level of benefits or employee premium level is offered 
                by the employer involved, the notice must explain which 
                level of benefits and employee premium level the 
                employee will be automatically enrolled in the absence 
                of an affirmative election by the employee.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
supersede State law which establishes, implements, or continues in 
effect any standard or requirement relating to employers in connection 
with payroll or the sponsoring of employer-sponsored health insurance 
coverage except to the extent that such standard or requirement 
prevents an employer from instituting the auto-enrollment described in 
subsection (a).
    (d) Non-Application to Excepted Benefits.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``group health plan'' does not include excepted 
benefits (as defined in section 2781(c) of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-91(c))).

striking ``plus'' at the end of paragraph (34), by striking the period 
at the end of paragraph (35) and inserting ``, plus'', and by adding at 
the end the following new paragraph:

        among the States as determined by the Secretary.
            (2) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as preventing a State from using funding under

        funding reinsurance or other risk mechanisms.
    (c) Limitation.--Funding under subsection (a) may only be used for

                created before the date of the enactment of this Act

                            (i) offers at least the option of one or 
                        more high-deductible plan options, in 
                        combination with a contribution into a health

                prospective basis under which a health insurance issuer 
                cedes covered lives to the pool in exchange for payment 
                of a reinsurance premium.
            (3) Transition.--Nothing in this section shall be construed

of this subsection, for the availability of bonus payments to a State 
under subsection (d), are as follows, in the case of an individual who

        annual basis) the following:

                section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) of all 
                individuals in the individual's family does not exceed 
                the poverty line (as defined in section 673(2) of the 
                Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9902(2)),

administration of this section and may establish such terms and 
conditions, including the requirement of an application, as may be 
appropriate to carry out this section.

requiring a State to operate a reinsurance pool (or other risk-
adjustment mechanism) under this section or as preventing a State from 
operating such a pool or mechanism through one or more private 
entities.

                benefits coverage through the IHP, makes available 
                health benefits coverage in the manner described in

                        approved under State law, or preventing a

        construed as preventing the establishment and operation of more 
        than one IHP in a geographic area or as limiting the number of 
        IHPs that may operate in any area.

                shall be applied consistently to all members within the 
                IHP and shall not be based in any manner on health

at the end the following new part:

``PART D--COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE

``SEC. 2795. DEFINITIONS.

    ``In this part:
            ``(1) Primary state.--The term `primary State' means, with 
        respect to individual health insurance coverage offered by a 
        health insurance issuer, the State designated by the issuer as 
        the State whose covered laws shall govern the health insurance 
        issuer in the sale of such coverage under this part. An issuer, 
        with respect to a particular policy, may only designate one 
        such State as its primary State with respect to all such 
        coverage it offers. Such an issuer may not change the 
        designated primary State with respect to individual health 
        insurance coverage once the policy is issued, except that such 
        a change may be made upon renewal of the policy. With respect 
        to such designated State, the issuer is deemed to be doing 
        business in that State.
            ``(2) Secondary state.--The term `secondary State' means, 
        with respect to individual health insurance coverage offered by 
        a health insurance issuer, any State that is not the primary 
        State. In the case of a health insurance issuer that is selling 
        a policy in, or to a resident of, a secondary State, the issuer 
        is deemed to be doing business in that secondary State.
            ``(3) Health insurance issuer.--The term `health insurance 
        issuer' has the meaning given such term in section 2791(b)(2), 
        except that such an issuer must be licensed in the primary 
        State and be qualified to sell individual health insurance 
        coverage in that State.
            ``(4) Individual health insurance coverage.--The term 
        `individual health insurance coverage' means health insurance 
        coverage offered in the individual market, as defined in 
        section 2791(e)(1), but does not include excepted benefits 
        described in section 2791(c).
            ``(5) Applicable state authority.--The term `applicable 
        State authority' means, with respect to a health insurance 
        issuer in a State, the State insurance commissioner or official 
        or officials designated by the State to enforce the 
        requirements of this title for the State with respect to the 
        issuer.

        the treatment was provided in a manner consistent with an 
        applicable guideline issued under subsection (a), the defendant 
        may not be held liable unless the plaintiff establishes the 
        liability of the defendant by clear and convincing evidence.
            (2) Limitation on introduction as evidence against a 
        defendant.--Guidelines issued under subsection (a) may not be 
        introduced as evidence of negligence or deviation in the 
        standard of care in any health care lawsuit unless they have 
        previously been introduced by the defendant.
            (3) No presumption of negligence against a defendant.--
        There shall be no presumption of negligence with respect to 
        treatment if a health care provider provides the treatment in a 
        manner inconsistent with such guidelines.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
preventing a State from--
            (1) replacing their current medical malpractice rules with 
        rules that rely, as a defense, upon a health care provider's 
        compliance with a guideline issued under subsection (a); or
            (2) applying additional guidelines or limitations on 
        liability that are in addition to, but not in lieu of, the 
        guidelines issued under subsection (a).

receive a grant under this section, a State shall submit to the 
Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and containing 
such information as may be required by the Secretary. A grant shall be 
awarded under this section on such terms and conditions as the 
Secretary determines appropriate.
    ``(c) Representation by Counsel.--A State that receives a grant 
under this section may not preclude any party to a dispute before an 
administrative health care tribunal operated under such grant from 
obtaining legal representation during any review by the expert panel 
under subsection (d), the administrative health care tribunal under 
subsection (e), or a State court under subsection (f).
    ``(d) Expert Panel Review and Early Offer Guidelines.--
            ``(1) In general.--If, in any health care liability action 
        against a health care provider, the health care provider 
        alleges, in any response to the claimant's filing, that the 
        health care provider adhered to an applicable practice 
        guideline in the provision of health care items or services to 
        the claimant, then further proceedings on the health care 
        liability action shall be suspended prior to discovery 
        proceedings, until the completion of a review of the action by 
        an independent expert panel in accordance with this subsection.

                guidelines or that the defendant's failure to conform 
                to the required standard was neither the cause in fact 
                nor the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury or 
                that the plaintiff did not incur any damages as a 
                result shall be given deference by the State court 
                involved and shall entitle the defendant to summary 
                judgment unless the plaintiff is able to show by clear 
                and convincing evidence that the expert panel or health 
                care tribunal, respectively, was in error and that 
                there is a genuine issue as to a material fact in the 
                case.
    ``(g) Definition.--In this section, the term `health care provider' 
means any person or entity required by State or Federal laws or 
regulations to be licensed, registered, or certified to provide health 
care services, and being either so licensed, registered, or certified, 
or exempted from such requirement by other statute or regulation.
    ``(h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for any fiscal year such sums as may be necessary for 
purposes of making grants to States under this section.''.

SEC. 403. PAYMENT OF DAMAGES AND RECOVERY OF COSTS IN HEALTH CARE 
              LAWSUITS.

    (a) Authorization of Payment of Future Damages to Claimants in 
Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of 
future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or 
exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or 
other assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court 
shall, at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the 
future damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the 
Uniform Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
    (b) Recovery of Costs; Payment of Award.--In any health care 
lawsuit, the court may supervise the arrangements for payment of 
damages to protect against conflicts of interest that may have the 
effect of reducing the amount of damages awarded that are actually paid 
to claimants. In particular, in any health care lawsuit in which the 
attorney for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by virtue 
of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power to restrict the 
payment of a claimant's damage recovery to such attorney, and to 
redirect such damages to the claimant based upon the interests of 
justice and principles of equity.
    (c) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions which have 
not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of 
this title.
    (d) Statute of Limitations.--Except in the case of a State law that 
provides for a shorter period of time, the time for the commencement of 
a health care lawsuit shall be no more than 3 years after the date of 
manifestation of injury or 1 year after the claimant discovers, or 
through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the 
injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall the time for 
commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of 
manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the following--
            (1) upon proof of fraud;
            (2) intentional concealment; or
            (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
        therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of 
        the injured person.
Except in the case of a State law that provides for a shorter period of 
time, actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the 
date of the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a 
minor under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years 
of manifestation of injury or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, 
whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be 
tolled for minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and 
a health care provider or health care organization have committed fraud 
or collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured 
minor.
    (e) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 
be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 
for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 
the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 
liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 
rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 
party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 
the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.
    (f) Apologies.--In any health care lawsuit, if a claimant receives 
any expression of regret for any act pertaining to conduct giving rise 
to the health care lawsuit, such expression of regret, notwithstanding 
any applicable rule of evidence may not be admitted into evidence in 
the health care lawsuit.
