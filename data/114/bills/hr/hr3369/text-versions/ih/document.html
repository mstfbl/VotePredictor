                                 A BILL


 
 To establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in the Department of 
  Education, make other modifications to Federal law to improve rural 
                    schools, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Restructuring Underutilized 
Resources for Advancing Learning Act'' or the ``RURAL Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Rural schools have unique challenges and benefits.
            (2) More than 33 percent of regular elementary and 
        secondary public schools nationwide are in locations classified 
        as rural. As of the 2010-2011 school year, more than 20 percent 
        of public school students were enrolled in rural school 
        districts.
            (3) In rural areas of the United States, 6,100,000 children 
        live in poverty.
            (4) Among children living in rural areas, 24 percent live 
        in poverty, compared to 20 percent among nonrural children.
            (5) Rural schools have fewer financial resources than non-
        rural schools, largely as a result of diminished local property 
        tax bases and inequitable distributions of State funds.
            (6) There is a substantial pay gap for teachers and 
        administrators in rural school districts. Rural teachers and 
        administrators in the U.S. earn about $10,000 less than their 
        counterparts in nonrural schools.
            (7) Rural schools have difficulty recruiting and retaining 
        teachers. A recent survey of rural school superintendents 
        suggests low salaries combined with social and geographic 
        isolation are the primary factors responsible for difficulties 
        recruiting and retaining teachers.
            (8) Digital learning technology holds the promise of 
        transforming rural education by removing barriers of distance 
        and increasing school capacity.
            (9) While many large urban local education agencies are at 
        the forefront of implementing new digital learning innovations, 
        it is often harder for smaller and more rural local education 
        agencies to access these tools. Smaller local education 
        agencies with less capacity may also find it more difficult to 
        provide the training needed to effectively implement new 
        digital learning technologies.
            (10) Low literacy rates among parents in poor rural 
        communities affect the early language development and 
        educational aspirations of children.
            (11) Investing in after-school programs helps children in 
        rural communities break out of the cycle of poverty and creates 
        opportunities for at-risk youth.
            (12) In areas in which resources are limited, after-school 
        programs are often the only source of supplemental enrichment 
        in literacy, nutrition education, technology, and preparation 
        for college and entrance exams.
            (13) Children attending rural schools have the lowest 
        median per-student funding for after-school programs under the 
        21st Century Community Learning Center Program under part B of 
        title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 
        (20 U.S.C. 7171 et seq.), as compared to children attending 
        urban and suburban schools.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy in the 
        Department of Education;
            (2) to provide input to the Secretary of Education 
        regarding the impact of proposed changes in law, regulations, 
        policies, rules, and budgets on rural schools and communities;
            (3) to provide a tax incentive to individuals teaching in 
        elementary and secondary schools located in rural or high 
        unemployment areas and to individuals who achieve certification 
        from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards;
            (4) to support the expansion of the use of digital learning 
        through competitive grants to partnerships to implement and 
        evaluate the results of technology-based learning practices, 
        strategies, tools, or programs at rural schools; and
            (5) to enhance after-school programs in rural areas by 
        helping communities establish after-school programs and improve 
        existing programs by over-coming barriers to service.
