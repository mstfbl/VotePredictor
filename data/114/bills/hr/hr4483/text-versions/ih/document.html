investigator, dedicated full time, to conduct an investigation in order 
to determine--
            (1) who was at fault for the Gold King Mine spill;
            (2) which individuals were responsible for the decisions 
        that led to the spill; and
            (3) what downstream environmental effects were caused by 
        the actions of the Environmental Protection Agency, or the 
        Environmental Protection Agency's failure to take action, after 
        the Gold King Mine spill.
    (b) Compensation From Environmental Protection Agency.--The special 
investigator shall be compensated for expenses incurred in the course 
of conducting the investigation under subsection (a) by amounts 
provided in advance in appropriation Acts to the Administrator. The 
special investigator shall be paid at a rate not to exceed the rate of 
basic pay for GS-14 of the General Schedule. If the special 
investigator is a full-time officer or employee of the United States, 
the special investigator may not receive additional pay, allowances, or 
benefits by reason of his or her service as a special investigator 
under this section.
    (c) Authorities of Special Investigator.--
            (1) Staff.--The special investigator may appoint and fix 
        the pay of additional personnel as the special investigator 
        considers appropriate. Staff members appointed by the special 
        investigator under this paragraph who are full-time officers or 
        employees of the United States may not receive additional pay, 
        allowances, or benefits by reason of their service to the 
        special investigator.
            (2) Staff of federal agencies.--Upon the request of the 
        special investigator, the head of any Federal department or 
        agency may detail any of the personnel of that department or 
        agency to assist the special investigator in carrying out his 
        or her duties under this section.
            (3) Obtaining official data.--The special investigator may 
        secure directly from any department or agency of the United 
        States information necessary to enable the special investigator 
        to carry out this section. Upon the request of the special 
        investigator, the head of that department or agency shall 
        furnish that information to the special investigator.
            (4) Subpoena power.--
                    (A) In general.--The special investigator may issue 
                subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of 
                witnesses and the production of any evidence relating 
                to any matter that the special investigator is 
                empowered to investigate under this section. The 
                attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence 
                may be required from any place within the United States 
                at any designated place of hearing within the United 
                States.
                    (B) Failure to obey a subpoena.--If a person 
                refuses to obey a subpoena issued under subparagraph 
                (A), the special investigator may apply to a United 
                States district court for an order requiring that 
                person to appear before the special investigator to 
                give testimony, produce evidence, or both, relating to 
                the matter under investigation. The application may be 
                made within the judicial district where the hearing is 
                conducted or where that person is found, resides, or 
                transacts business. Any failure to obey the order of 
                the court may be punished by the court as civil 
                contempt.
                    (C) Service of subpoenas.--The subpoenas of the 
                special investigator shall be served in the manner 
                provided for subpoenas issued by a United States 
                district court under the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure for the United States district courts.
