                                 A BILL


 
   To revise Federal flammability standards for motor vehicle child 
                           restraint systems.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS FROM CERTAIN 
              REGULATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration shall revise its regulations establishing flammability 
standards set out in section 571.302 of title 49, Code of Federal 
Regulations, for any child restraint system (as defined in section 
571.213 of such title). Such revised standard shall measure the smolder 
ignition resistance of such restraint systems rather than the open 
flame flammability of such systems. In revising such regulations, the 
Administration shall consider the standard and testing methodologies 
contained in California Technical Bulletin 117-2013, ``Requirements, 
Test Procedure and Apparatus for Testing the Smolder Resistance of 
Materials Used in Upholstered Furniture''.
    (b) Consult With EPA.--In revising such regulations, the 
Administration shall consult the Environmental Protection Agency 
regarding the health effects and exposure risks associated with 
materials used in such restraint systems and shall consider such health 
effects and risks in determining an appropriate standard.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
