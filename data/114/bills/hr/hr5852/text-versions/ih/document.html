    (b) Allocation of Customer Property to Customers.--Section 8(c) of 
the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(c)) 
is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by amending subparagraph (B) to read 
        as follows:
                    ``(B) second, to customers of such debtor, as 
                described under paragraph (4);''; and

                Act, allocations of customer property to customers

    (c) Prohibition on Certain Recoveries.--
            (1) In general.--Section 8 of the Securities Investor 
        Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78fff-2) is amended by adding 
        at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Prohibition on Certain Recoveries.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, a trustee may not recover any property 
transferred by the debtor to a customer before the filing date unless, 
at the time of such transfer, such customer--
            ``(1) knew the debtor was involved in fraudulent activity 
        with respect to any customer of the debtor which reasonably 
        indicated a fraud adversely affecting a substantial number of

                        adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 
                        1940 but for section 203(m) of such Act;

                person causing such person to be described under 
                subparagraph (A), should have known, that the debtor 
                was involved in fraudulent activity with respect to any 
                customer of the debtor; and
                    ``(C) did not notify SIPC, the Commission, or law 
                enforcement personnel that the debtor was involved in 
                such fraudulent activity.''.
            (2) Construction.--Nothing in this Act, or the amendments 
        made by this Act, shall be construed as prohibiting a trustee 
        appointed under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 
        from recovering property transferred by a debtor to a person 
        who is not a customer of the debtor.
    (d) Definition of Customer Status.--Section 16(2)(B) of the 
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(B)) is 
amended--
            (1) in clause (ii), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a 
        semicolon;
            (2) in clause (iii), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting a semicolon; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new clauses:
                            ``(iv) any person that had cash or 
                        securities that were converted or otherwise

                        who controls, is controlled by, or is under 
                        common control with the debtor, if such person 
                        was operating through the debtor), irrespective 
                        of whether the debtor held or otherwise had 
                        custody, possession, or control of such cash or 
                        securities; and

                        in its discretion and without any need for

                        debtor.''.

Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78ccc) is amended by adding 
at the end the following:

        through the debtor) committed fraud, the Commission may
