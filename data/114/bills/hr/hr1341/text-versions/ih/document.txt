                located in a high cost area, there shall be substituted 
                `the specified percentage' for `400 percent' in 
                paragraph (3)(A)(i) and in subsections (c)(1)(A) and 
                (f)(2)(B).
                    ``(B) High cost area.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `high cost area' means any 
                metropolitan statistical area or non-metropolitan area 
                the SPM for which exceeds the national average SPM.
                    ``(C) Specified percentage.--For purposes of this

                respect to a taxpayer whose principal place of 
                residence for any taxable year is located in a high 
                cost area, the product of 400 percent and the SPM 
                adjustment for such area.
                    ``(D) SPM.--For purposes of this paragraph--
                            ``(i) In general.--The term `SPM' means, 
                        with respect to each calendar year, the 
                        Supplemental Poverty Measure as determined by 
                        the Bureau of the Census.
                            ``(ii) National average spm.--The national 
                        average SPM shall be determined without regard 
                        to Alaska and Hawaii.
                            ``(iii) Determination for taxable year 
                        based on preceding calendar year.--SPM with 
                        respect to any taxable year shall be determined 
                        on the basis of the calendar year preceding the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins.

                Census.
                    ``(F) Alternative measure of cost-of-living.--If 
                the Secretary determines that another measure of cost-
                of-living is more appropriate than the SPM for purposes 
                of this paragraph, the Secretary shall use such measure 
                in lieu of the SPM.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply
