                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a commission to examine the processes used by the Bureau 
     of Labor Statistics to provide unemployment rates and to make 
     recommendations to Congress for any changes in methodology or 
                    improvements to such processes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Labor Statistics Improvement Act''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.

    There is established an independent commission to be known as the 
``Commission to Improve Labor Statistics''.

SEC. 3. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.

    The Commission shall--
            (1) examine and make an assessment of the process by which 
        the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects, processes, analyzes, 
        and disseminates statistical data relating to unemployment 
        rates, including--
                    (A) the methods used for determining that an 
                individual is or is not considered to be looking for 
                work, including what constitutes actively looking 
                versus passively looking or ``discouraged'' and how to 
                take into account the intensity with which individuals 
                are searching for a job; and
                    (B) the utility of the six measures used by the 
                Bureau for reporting labor underutilization;
            (2) formulate recommendations for any improvement to such 
        process and methods, including proposals for any alternative 
        measures of labor force participation, taking into account 
        evidence that--
                    (A) the official unemployment rate doesn't always 
                accurately reflect labor market strength; and
                    (B) unemployment rates may vary over a business 
                cycle due to changes in labor force participation 
                rather than from factors affecting labor market 
                strength, including--
                            (i) the employment-to-population (EPOP) 
                        ratio for prime-age individuals and the 
                        existence of ``missing workers'' or potential 
                        workers who, because of weak job opportunities, 
                        are neither employed nor actively seeking a 
                        job;
                            (ii) the voluntary quits rate; and
                            (iii) the rates of wage growth and 
                        reservation wage of potential workers; and
            (3) develop a new method or methods for determining and 
        reporting underemployment that takes into consideration 
        workers--
                    (A) who are not in jobs that match their skill set 
                or education; and
                    (B) who are earning less than other workers in 
                similar occupations or with similar skill sets and 
                education.
