                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             July 23, 2015

Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas (for herself and Mr. Smith of Texas) 
 introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on 
                     Science, Space, and Technology

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To advance United States leadership in planetary science and space 
               exploration though education and outreach.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Planetary Leadership Utilizing 
Teaching and Observations Act'' or the ``PLUTO Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of NASA.
            (2) NASA.--The term ``NASA'' means the National Aeronautics 
        and Space Administration.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The New Frontiers Program represents a pivotal step in 
        the advancement of solar system exploration.
            (2) The missions in the program tackle specific solar 
        system exploration goals identified as top priorities by 
        consensus of the planetary community.
            (3) The New Frontiers strategy is to explore the solar 
        system with frequent, medium-class spacecraft missions that 
        conduct high-quality, focused scientific investigations 
        designed to enhance our understanding of the solar system.
            (4) The program objective is to launch high-science-return 
        planetary investigations on an average of one every 36 months.
            (5) Added to the NASA budget for the first time in 2003, 
        New Frontiers builds on the innovative approaches used in 
        NASA's Discovery and Explorer Programs, but provides a 
        mechanism for identifying and selecting missions that cannot be 
        accomplished within the cost and time constraints of Discovery.
            (6) The New Horizons mission was the first mission launched 
        under the New Frontiers program.
            (7) The fastest spacecraft ever launched, the New Horizons 
        mission successfully completed the first reconnaissance of the 
        Pluto system.
            (8) The exploration of outer space and the development of 
        space sciences are in the national interests of the United 
        States.
            (9) In order to maintain preeminence in space science and 
        exploration, it is imperative that the next generation of 
        explorers is inspired to study science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
            (10) NASA's science missions make unique contributions to 
        education by sharing the story, the science, and the adventure 
        of NASA's scientific explorations through public outreach.
            (11) One to two percent of the cost for each New Frontiers 
        mission is allocated to education and public outreach 
        activities that feature the science of the mission and its 
        discoveries to enhance learning at all levels.
            (12) Planetary sciences, including the New Horizons 
        mission, inspire students to study science, engineering, 
        technology, and mathematics (STEM).

SEC. 4. DIRECTION.

    The Administrator shall use observations, measurements, data, and 
discoveries derived from the New Horizons mission to--
            (1) enhance public awareness and appreciation for space 
        exploration and engage the public in the process of scientific 
        discovery;
            (2) communicate the importance of planetary science to 
        students and teachers;
            (3) advance domestic science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (STEM) education;
            (4) promote mutually beneficial international scientific 
        partnerships; and
            (5) facilitate future progress in planetary science.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
