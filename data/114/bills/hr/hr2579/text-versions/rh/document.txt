SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has 
        inadvertently created a star rating system under section 
        1853(o)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-
        23(o)(4)) for Medicare Advantage plans that lacks proper 
        accounting for the socioeconomic status of enrollees in such 
        plans and the extent to which such plans serve individuals who 
        are also eligible for medical assistance under title XIX of 
        such Act; and
            (2) Congress will work with the Centers for Medicare & 
        Medicaid Services and stakeholders, including beneficiary 
        groups and managed care organizations, to ensure that such 
        rating system properly accounts for the socioeconomic status of 
        enrollees in such plans and the extent to which such plans 
        serve such individuals described in paragraph (1).
