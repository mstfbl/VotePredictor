SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Career-Ready Student Veterans Act''.

SEC. 2. APPROVAL OF COURSES USING EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY 
              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Approval of Non-Accredited Courses.--Subsection (c) of section 
3676 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraph (14) as paragraph (16); and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (13) the following new 
        paragraphs:
            ``(14) In the case of a program designed to prepare an 
        individual for licensure or certification in a State, the 
        program meets any instructional curriculum licensure or 
        certification requirements of such State.
            ``(15) In the case of a program designed to prepare an 
        individual for employment pursuant to standards developed by a 
        board or agency of a State in an occupation that requires 
        approval or licensure, the program is approved or licensed by 
        such board or agency of the State.''.
    (b) Exceptions.--Such section is further amended by adding at the 
end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (14) or 
(15) of subsection (c) in the case of a program of education offered by 
an educational institution if the Secretary determines the following:
            ``(1) The educational institution is accredited by an 
        agency or association recognized by the Secretary of Education.
            ``(2) The program did not meet the requirements of such 
        paragraph at any time during the two-year period preceding the 
        date of the waiver.
            ``(3) The waiver furthers the purposes of the educational 
        assistance programs administered by the Secretary or would 
        further the education interests of individuals eligible for 
        assistance under such programs.
            ``(4) The educational institution does not provide any 
        commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or 
        indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid 
        to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or 
        admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award 
        of student financial assistance, except for the recruitment of 
        foreign students residing in foreign countries who are not 
        eligible to receive Federal student assistance.''.
    (c) Approval of Accredited Courses at For-Profit Educational 
Institutions.--Section 3675(b)(3) of such title is amended--
            (1) by striking ``and (3)'' and inserting ``(3), (14), and 
        (15)''; and
            (2) by inserting before the period at the end the 
        following: ``(or, with respect to such paragraphs (14) and 
        (15), the requirements under such paragraphs are waived 
        pursuant to subsection (f) of section 3676)''.
    (d) Applicability.--If after enrollment in a course of education 
that is subject to disapproval by reason of an amendment made by this 
Act, an individual pursues one or more courses of education at the same 
educational institution while remaining continuously enrolled (other 
than during regularly scheduled breaks between courses, semesters or 
terms) at that institution, any course so pursued by the individual at 
that institution while so continuously enrolled shall not be subject to 
disapproval by reason of such amendment.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
