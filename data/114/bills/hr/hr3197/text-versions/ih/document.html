                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit Federal funding to entities that do not certify the 
 entities will not perform, or provide any funding to any other entity 
                      that performs, an abortion.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON ABORTION.

    (a) Prohibition.--No Federal funds may be provided (directly or 
indirectly, including through contract or subcontract) to an entity 
unless the entity certifies that, during the period for which such 
funds are provided, the entity will not perform, and will not provide 
any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion.
    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect to an 
abortion where--
            (1) the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest; or
            (2) a physician certifies that the woman suffers from a 
        physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that 
        would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
        performed, including a life-threatening physical condition 
        caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
    (c) Hospitals.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect to a 
hospital, so long as such hospital does not, during the period for 
which funds described in subsection (a) are provided to such hospital, 
provide funds to any non-hospital entity that performs an abortion 
(other than an abortion described in subsection (b)).
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``entity'' means the entire legal entity, 
        including any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is 
        under common control with such entity.
            (2) The term ``hospital'' has the meaning given to such 
        term in section 1861(e) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1395x(e)).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
