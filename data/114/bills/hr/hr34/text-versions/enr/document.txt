determination under subparagraph (D)--
        ``(i) such sponsor may request, and the Secretary shall

    one or more studies (which may be nonclinical, clinical, or both) 
    to establish the relevance, if any, of the chemical action in 
    achieving the primary mode of action of such product;

    sponsor conducts one or more of such studies, the Secretary shall 
    consider the data resulting from any such study when reevaluating 
    the determination of the primary mode of action of such product, 
    and unless and until such reevaluation has occurred and the 
    Secretary issues a new determination, the determination of the 
    Secretary under subparagraph (D) shall remain in effect.
    ``(2)(A)(i) To establish clarity and certainty for the sponsor, the 
sponsor of a combination product may request a meeting on such 
combination product. If the Secretary concludes that a determination of 
the primary mode of action pursuant to paragraph (1)(D) is necessary, 
the sponsor may request such meeting only after the Secretary makes 
such determination. If the sponsor submits a written meeting request, 
the Secretary shall, not later than 75 calendar days after receiving 
such request, meet with the sponsor of such combination product.

        ``(I) address the standards and requirements for market 
    approval or clearance of the combination product;

    product, such as requirements related to postmarket modification of 
    such combination product and good manufacturing practices 
    applicable to such combination product; and

    may be more appropriate for discussion and agreement with the 
    Secretary at a later date given that scientific or other 
    information is not available, or agreement is otherwise not 
    feasible regarding such elements, at the time a request for such 
    meeting is made.

    division of the primary agency center, or a person more senior than 
    such director, in consultation with consulting centers and the 
    Office, as appropriate, that an issue essential to determining 
    whether the standard for market clearance or other applicable 
    standard under this Act or the Public Health Service Act applicable 
    to the combination product has been identified since the agreement 
    was reached, or that deviating from the agreement is otherwise 
    justifiable based on scientific evidence, for public health 
    reasons.
    ``(3) For purposes of conducting the premarket review of a 
combination product that contains an approved constituent part 
described in paragraph (4), the Secretary may require that the sponsor 
of such combination product submit to the Secretary only data or

    treatment in such limited population. Such drug may be approved 
    under this subsection notwithstanding a lack of evidence to fully 
    establish a favorable benefit-risk profile in a population that is 
    broader than the intended limited population.
        ``(3) Additional requirements.--A drug approved under this 
    subsection shall be subject to the following requirements, in 
    addition to any other applicable requirements of this Act:
            ``(A) Labeling.--To indicate that the safety and 
        effectiveness of a drug approved under this subsection has been 
        demonstrated only with respect to a limited population--

    considerations for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of 
    limited population antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The 
    Secretary shall publish final guidance within 18 months of the 
    close of the public comment period on such draft guidance. The 
    Secretary may approve antibacterial and antifungal drugs under this 
    subsection prior to issuing guidance under this paragraph.

        Congress not less often than once every 2 years on the number 
        of requests for approval, and the number of approvals, of an 
        antibacterial or antifungal drug under this subsection.
            ``(B) GAO report.--Not later than December 2021, the 
        Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the 
        Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor 
        and Pensions of the Senate a report on the coordination of 
        activities required under section 319E of the Public Health 
        Service Act. Such report shall include a review of such 
        activities, and the extent to which the use of the pathway 
        established under this subsection has streamlined premarket 
        approval for antibacterial or antifungal drugs for limited 
        populations, if such pathway has functioned as intended, if 
        such pathway has helped provide for safe and effective 
        treatment for patients, if such premarket approval would be 
        appropriate for other categories of drugs, and if the 
        authorities under this subsection have affected antibacterial 
        or antifungal resistance.''.

        microorganisms that leads to the development of resistance to 
        drugs that have been effective in decreasing morbidity and 
        mortality for patients, which warrants unique management of 
        antimicrobial drugs that is inappropriate for most other drugs 
        in order to delay or prevent the development of further 
        resistance to existing therapies;
            ``(B) provide for public notice of the availability of 
        recognized interpretive criteria and interpretive criteria 
        standards; and

        of the drug under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act 
        (as applicable), upon such approval or licensure; or
            ``(B) if such criteria are unavailable on such date, on the 
        date on which such criteria are available for such drug.
        ``(3) Bases for initial identification.--The Secretary shall 
    identify appropriate susceptibility test interpretive criteria 
    under paragraph (2), based on the Secretary's review of, to the 
    extent available and relevant--
            ``(A) preclinical and clinical data, including 
        pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and epidemiological data;

    who are dually eligible for the Medicare program under title XVIII 
    of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the 
    Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
    seq.) and those with chronic conditions, whose care may be improved 
    most in terms of quality and efficiency by the expansion, in a 
    manner that meets or exceeds the existing in-person standard of 
    care under the Medicare program under such title XVIII, of 
    telehealth services under section 1834(m)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
    1395m(m)(4)).
        (2) Activities by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
    Innovation which examine the use of telehealth services in models, 
    projects, or initiatives funded through section 1115A of such Act 
    (42 U.S.C. 1315a).
        (3) The types of high-volume services (and related diagnoses) 
    under such title XVIII which might be suitable to be furnished 
    using telehealth.
        (4) Barriers that might prevent the expansion of telehealth 
    services under section 1834(m)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 
    U.S.C. 1395m(m)(4)) beyond such services that are in effect as of 
    the date of enactment of this Act.

2018, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission established under 
section 1805 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395b-6) shall,

information to the committees of jurisdiction of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate that identifies--
        (1) the telehealth services for which payment can be made, as 
    of the date of enactment of this Act, under the fee-for-service 
    program under parts A and B of title XVIII of such Act;
        (2) the telehealth services for which payment can be made, as 
    of such date, under private health insurance plans; and
        (3) with respect to services identified under paragraph (2) but 
    not under paragraph (1), ways in which payment for such services 
    might be incorporated into such fee-for-service program (including 
    any recommendations for ways to accomplish this incorporation).
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) eligible originating sites should be expanded beyond those 
    originating sites described in section 1834(m)(4)(C) of the Social 
    Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m(m)(4)(C)); and
        (2) any expansion of telehealth services under the Medicare 
    program under title XVIII of such Act should--
            (A) recognize that telemedicine is the delivery of safe, 
        effective, quality health care services, by a health care 
        provider, using technology as the mode of care delivery;
            (B) meet or exceed the conditions of coverage and payment 
        with respect to the Medicare program if the service was 
        furnished in person, including standards of care, unless 
        specifically addressed in subsequent legislation; and
            (C) involve clinically appropriate means to furnish such 
        services.

             TITLE XI--COMPASSIONATE COMMUNICATION ON HIPAA

SEC. 11001. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, in 
    2015, there were approximately 9,800,000 adults in the United 
    States with serious mental illness.
        (2) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
    Administration defines the term ``serious mental illness'' as an 
    illness affecting individuals 18 years of age or older as having, 
    at any time in the past year, a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or 
    emotional disorder that results in serious functional impairment 
    and substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life 
    activities.
        (3) In reporting on the incidence of serious mental illness, 
    the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
    includes major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and 
    other mental disorders that cause serious impairment.
        (4) Adults with a serious mental illness are at a higher risk 
    for chronic physical illnesses and premature death.
        (5) According to the World Health Organization, adults with a 
    serious mental illness have lifespans that are 10 to 25 years 
    shorter than those without serious mental illness. The vast 
    majority of these deaths are due to chronic physical medical 
    conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and infectious 
    diseases, as well as diabetes and hypertension.
        (6) According to the World Health Organization, the majority of 
    deaths of adults with a serious mental illness that are due to 
    physical medical conditions are preventable.
        (7) Supported decision making can facilitate care decisions in 
    areas where serious mental illness may impact the capacity of an 
    individual to determine a course of treatment while still allowing 
    the individual to make decisions independently.
        (8) Help should be provided to adults with a serious mental 
    illness to address their acute or chronic physical illnesses, make 
    informed choices about treatment, and understand and follow through 
    with appropriate treatment.
        (9) There is confusion in the health care community regarding 
    permissible practices under the regulations promulgated under the 
    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
    (commonly known as ``HIPAA''). This confusion may hinder 
    appropriate communication of health care information or treatment 
    preferences with appropriate caregivers.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
clarification is needed regarding the privacy rule promulgated under 
section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 1320d-2 note) regarding existing permitted uses 
and disclosures of health information by health care professionals to 
communicate with caregivers of adults with a serious mental illness to 
facilitate treatment.
SEC. 11002. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS.
    Not later than 1 year after the date on which the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services (in this title referred to as the 
``Secretary'') first finalizes regulations updating part 2 of title 42, 
Code of Federal Regulations, relating to confidentiality of alcohol and 
drug abuse patient records, after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary shall convene relevant stakeholders to determine the

        to object cannot practicably be provided because of the 
        incapacity of the patient or an emergency treatment 
        circumstance; and
            (D) are determined, based on the exercise of professional

            (B) in the case that the patient is an adult, communicating

        caregivers of the patient, law enforcement, or others when the 
        patient presents a serious and imminent threat of harm to self 
        or others; and
            (G) communicating to law enforcement and family members or 
        caregivers of the patient about the admission of the patient to 
        receive care at, or the release of a patient from, a facility 
        for an emergency psychiatric hold or involuntary treatment.

            most accurately measure the functional status of enrollees 
            in Medicare Advantage plans and whether the use of such

            adjustment payments under the Medicare Advantage program 
            under part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act. 
            Such study shall include an analysis of the challenges in

            together with recommendations for such legislation and 
            administrative action as the Comptroller General determines 
            appropriate.
