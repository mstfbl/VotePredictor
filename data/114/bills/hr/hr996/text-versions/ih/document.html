SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many areas of undeveloped National Forest System lands, 
        National Park System lands, and public lands administered by 
        the Bureau of Land Management in the States of Idaho, Montana, 
        Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming possess outstanding natural 
        characteristics which give them high values as wilderness, 
        parks, and wild and scenic rivers and will, if properly 
        preserved, be an enduring resource of wilderness, wild land 
        areas, and biodiversity for the benefit of the American people.
            (2) The Northern Rockies Bioregion contains the most 
        diverse array of wild lands remaining south of Canada, 
        providing sanctuary for a host of species listed as threatened 
        or endangered under section 4(c) of the Endangered Species Act 
        of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)). These national interest public 
        lands are among the most popular wild lands in the United 
        States, embracing greater ecosystems and national treasures 
        such as the Greater Yellowstone, Greater Glacier/Northern 
        Continental Divide, Greater Hells Canyon/Wallowa, Greater 
        Salmon/Selway, and Greater Cabinet/Yaak/Selkirk ecosystems.
            (3) The natural ecosystems in the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion are largely dependent on National Forest System 
        lands, National Park System lands, and public lands 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management, and the 
        ecological productivity and diversity of resources these 
        Federal public lands provide. Conservation of roadless areas on 
        these public lands, which produces clean water, protects native 
        fisheries and native flora and fauna, and provides scenic and 
        recreational qualities, also preserves options for sustainable 
        economics through activities such as hunting, fishing, and 
        wilderness-based recreation.
            (4) The headwaters of several major river systems, 
        including the Columbia, Snake, Green, Missouri and Saskatchewan 
        Rivers, originate in the Northern Rockies Bioregion, and these 
        rivers send their waters to three different oceans. These 
        waters are of tremendous economic importance to farming and 
        ranching operations, municipal water supplies, and water-based 
        recreation, including fishing and boating. Protection of this 
        world class water resource will enhance these uses, reduce 
        costs for water treatment and irrigation, and increase native 
        fish populations.
            (5) The wildlife treasures of the Northern Rockies are of 
        international significance and contain remarkably intact large 
        mammalian fauna and rare and unique plant life. Wildlife 
        habitat fragmentation due to roadbuilding, timber harvest, 
        mining, oil and gas exploration, lack of interagency 
        cooperation, and other activities has severe effects on the 
        wildlife populations (including those listed as threatened or 
        endangered under section 4(c) of the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c))) and their habitat, the water quality, 
        the ancient forests, and the greater ecosystems of the Northern 
        Rockies Bioregion. The overemphasis on resource extraction from 
        National Forest System lands and public lands administered by 
        the Bureau of Land Management has compromised ecosystem 
        integrity and detracted from economic diversification 
        opportunities. Economic instability and high unemployment in 
        rural, resource-dependent communities is a common result of 
        overexploitation of these lands.
            (6) Continued fragmentation and development of the 
        remaining roadless and essentially roadless ecosystems and 
        biological connectors of the Northern Rockies would cause a 
        loss to the Nation of an entire wild land region and of the 
        only remaining areas south of Canada still pristine enough to 
        support populations of caribou, gray wolves, grizzly bears, 
        anadromous fish, and numerous other rare and endangered plant 
        and animal life all in one intact bioregion.
            (7) Since the 1936 roadless area inventory completed by Bob 
        Marshall, millions of acres of roadless wild lands have been 
        developed in the Northern Rockies. Extensive fragmentation of 
        wild lands and wildlife habitat has resulted in the listing of 
        several species as threatened or endangered and reduced the 
        numbers and range of many others, including anadromous fish.
            (8) The natural ecosystems of the Northern Rockies 
        Bioregion also serve as educational and research centers for 
        on-site studies in biology, geology, astronomy and other 
        sciences. The pristine nature of the National Forest System 
        lands, National Park System lands, and public lands 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the Northern 
        Rockies Bioregion helps local communities attract new residents 
        and businesses based on local quality of life.
            (9) A review of the current situation in the Northern 
        Rockies has revealed the urgent need for an ecological reserve 
        system for the Northern Rockies Bioregion, which includes core 
        ecosystem reserve areas and biological connecting corridors 
        necessary to ensure wildlife movements and genetic interchange 
        between the core reserve areas. Wildlife freedom of movement 
        has always been essential to the survival of wildlife species, 
        and an increasing number of scientific studies have identified 
        movement corridors as a necessity for wildlife conservation in 
        a changing climate. Several foreign governments, including the 
        governments of Australia and Scotland, have announced plans for 
        corridors that would make wildlife movement possible as climate 
        pressures increase. The concept of connective corridors for 
        wildlife movement has been endorsed by governors of States in 
        the western United States, and is now widely recognized by 
        conservation and scientific organizations. For example, freedom 
        of movement for wildlife is basic to the emerging new science 
        of ``Movement Ecology'' described in a December 2008 
        Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This freedom 
        of wildlife movement was a fundamental reason for the Act's 
        development and introduction, and has become an increasingly 
        high profile issue in the climate and biological sciences.
            (10) The economic value to the Nation of most of these 
        undeveloped areas, left in their natural state, greatly exceeds 
        any potential return to the Treasury of the United States from 
        timber harvest and development. If current Federal land 
        management in the Northern Rockies continues to result in the 
        development of roadless areas, the American public will be 
        using its tax dollars to fund permanent reductions in 
        wilderness, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, and 
        species and biological diversity.
            (11) Instead, this Act provides opportunities for 
        employment in outdoor trades by establishing rehabilitation 
        zones on specific tracts of damaged Federal land where active 
        restoration work will occur. This Act will provide contracts 
        for local businesses and renew the intrinsic economic, social 
        and cultural benefits that result from productive land. Federal 
        land rehabilitation projects represent a direct benefit to the 
        local economy and reduce the loss to American taxpayers caused 
        by below-cost timber sales and other subsidized resource 
        extraction.
            (12) The congressional review of roadless areas within the 
        National Forest System, National Park System, and public lands 
        administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the States of 
        Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming has identified 
        areas which, on the basis of their land form, ecosystem, 
        associated fish and wildlife, economic value, and location will 
        help to fulfill the role of the United States Forest Service, 
        National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management to ensure 
        a quality National Wilderness Preservation System. The review 
        has identified other areas which may have outstanding values as 
        wild and scenic rivers. The review has also identified areas 
        which may not possess outstanding wilderness attributes and 
        should not now be designated as components of the National 
        Wilderness Preservation System, but which should be studied to 
        determine their role in maintaining biological diversity in the 
        Northern Rockies.
            (13) Many areas of National Forest System lands and public 
        lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management have been 
        damaged and their productivity reduced by unwise development 
        practices, which have also impaired ecosystem function and 
        biological diversity. The Island Park area adjacent to 
        Yellowstone National Park contains large clear-cut areas right 
        up to the park boundary. Efforts should be made to return these 
        areas to their former ecological health and native diversity. 
        These efforts should seek to ensure that vital ecosystem 
        components are restored, especially in areas where wildlife 
        travel corridors and native fish and wildlife populations have 
        been damaged or eliminated. Restoration efforts should seek to 
        ensure and maintain genetic interchange, biological diversity, 
        and restoration of native species diversity throughout the 
        Northern Rockies Bioregion.
            (14) Backcountry areas of the National Park System have 
        been damaged by inappropriate management, despite policies that 
        require that recommended wilderness be administered as 
        wilderness. An emphasis on structures and motorized equipment, 
        and in some instances developed ``backcountry'' campsites, have 
        all detracted from and degraded the wilderness character of 
        these backcountry areas.
            (15) Federal agencies entrusted with managing the natural 
        resources of the Northern Rockies Bioregion operate under 
        contradictory congressional mandates, and thus are in 
        dissension over management policies which involve common 
        resources and greater ecosystems. Existing agency structures 
        and regulatory mechanisms have proven unsatisfactory for 
        responsible management of nationally important ecosystems on 
        public lands. Existing laws and regulations have not been 
        sufficient to establish and maintain agency accountability for 
        public resources.
            (16) This Act does not affect private existing rights.

               TITLE II--BIOLOGICAL CONNECTING CORRIDORS

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The most recent scientific information on ecological 
        reserve design and function, including recent scientific 
        information on species dispersal in response to a changing 
        climate, points out the critical need for biological connecting 
        corridors between the larger core ecosystem areas.
            (2) While none of the remaining major wild land ecosystems 
        of the Northern Rockies Bioregion appears to be of sufficient 
        size to perpetuate the full complement of self-sustaining 
        viable populations of native wildlife, biological diversity, 
        and full range of ecological processes on its own, it appears 
        that an effective reserve system can be achieved if biological 
        connecting corridors between the ecosystems are identified and 
        protected.
            (3) The wild land areas addressed by this title are located 
        between the major core ecosystems of the region and are 
        essential for wildlife and plant migration and genetic 
        interchange.
            (4) These areas are some of the most beautiful and wild 
        mountain ranges in the United States, including the Bitterroot, 
        Sapphire, Lost River, Lemhi, and Bridger mountain ranges.

this Act.

SEC. 605. NATIVE AMERICAN USES.

    (a) Definition.--For purposes of this section and section 505, the 
term ``protected areas'' means land designated by this Act as 
wilderness, wildland recovery areas, wild and scenic rivers, and 
biological corridors.
    (b) Nonexclusive Access.--In recognition of the past use of 
portions of the protected areas by Native Americans for traditional 
cultural and religious purposes, the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
Secretary of the Interior shall ensure nonexclusive access to these 
protected areas by native people for such traditional cultural and 
religious purposes. Such access shall be consistent with the purpose 
and intent of Public Law 95-341 (42 U.S.C. 1996; commonly known as the 
American Indian Religious Freedom Act), and, in the case of land 
designated as wilderness by this Act, the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 
1121 et seq.). The Secretaries, in accordance with such laws, upon 
request of an Indian tribe, may from time-to-time temporarily close to 
the general public use of one or more specific portions of these 
protected areas in order to protect the privacy of religious activities 
and cultural uses in such portions by an Indian people. As part of the 
preparation of general management plans for the protected areas, the 
Secretaries shall request that the chief executive officers of 
appropriate Indian tribes make recommendations with respect to assuring 
access to important sites, enhancing the privacy of traditional 
cultural and religious activities, and protecting cultural and 
religious sites.
