 on Federal lands by facilitating vegetation management on such lands.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electricity Reliability and Forest 
Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT, FACILITY INSPECTION, AND OPERATION AND 
              MAINTENANCE ON FEDERAL LANDS CONTAINING ELECTRIC 
              TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

    (a) In General.--Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1761 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new section:

``SEC. 512. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT, FACILITY INSPECTION, AND OPERATION, 
              AND MAINTENANCE RELATING TO ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND 
              DISTRIBUTION FACILITY RIGHTS-OF-WAY.

the electricity grid and reduce the threat of wildfires to and from 
electric transmission and distribution rights-of-way and related 
facilities and adjacent property, the Secretary, with respect to public 
lands and other lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, and the 
Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to National Forest System lands, 
shall provide direction to ensure that all existing and future rights-
of-way, however established (including by grant, special use 
authorization, and easement), for electrical transmission and 
distribution facilities on such lands include provisions for utility 
vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and 
maintenance activities that, while consistent with applicable law--
            ``(1) are developed in consultation with the holder of the 
        right-of-way;
            ``(2) enable the owner or operator of a facility to operate 
        and maintain the facility in good working order and to comply 
        with Federal, State and local electric system reliability and

                are necessary to control hazard trees within or 
                adjacent to electrical transmission and distribution 
                rights-of-way; and
            ``(4) when review is required, provide for expedited review 
        and approval of utility vegetation management, facility 
        inspection, and operation and maintenance activities, 
        especially activities requiring prompt action to avoid an 
        adverse impact on human safety or electric reliability to avoid 
        fire hazards.
    ``(b) Vegetation Management, Facility Inspection, and Operation and 
Maintenance Plans.--
            ``(1) Development and submission.--Consistent with 
        subsection (a), the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture 
        shall provide owners and operators of electric transmission and

        management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance 
        plan, that at each owner or operator's transmission discretion 
        may cover some or all of the owner or operator's transmission 
        and distribution rights-of-way on Federal lands, for approval 
        to the Secretary with jurisdiction over the lands. A plan under 
        this paragraph shall enable the owner or operator of a 
        facility, at a minimum, to comply with applicable Federal, 
        State, and local electric system reliability and fire safety 
        requirements, as provided in subsection (a)(2). The Secretaries 
        shall not have the authority to modify those requirements.
            ``(2) Review and approval process.--The Secretary and the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly develop a consolidated

                    ``(A) vegetation management, facility inspection, 
                and operation and maintenance plans submitted under 
                paragraph (1) that--
                            ``(i) assures prompt review and approval 
                        not to exceed 90 days;
                            ``(ii) includes timelines and benchmarks 
                        for agency comments to submitted plans and 
                        final approval of such plans;
                            ``(iii) is consistent with applicable law; 
                        and
                            ``(iv) minimizes the costs of the process 
                        to the reviewing agency and the entity 
                        submitting the plans; and
                    ``(B) amendments to the plans in a prompt manner if 
                changed conditions necessitate a modification to a 
                plan.
            ``(3) Notification.--The review and approval process under 
        paragraph (2) shall--
                    ``(A) include notification by the agency of any 
                changed conditions that warrant a modification to a 
                plan;
                    ``(B) provide an opportunity for the owner or 
                operator to submit a proposed plan amendment to address 
                directly the changed condition; and
                    ``(C) allow the owner or operator to continue to 
                implement those elements of the approved plan that do 
                not directly and adversely affect the condition 
                precipitating the need for modification.
            ``(4) Categorical exclusion process.--The Secretary and the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall apply his or her categorical 
        exclusion process under the National Environmental Policy Act
