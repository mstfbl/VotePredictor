 To amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to establish an Office 
 of Rural Broadband Initiatives in the Department of Agriculture, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Broadband Initiative Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 helped bring 
        electricity and telephone service to rural America, thus 
        removing major barriers to the development of our rural 
        economies.
            (2) A lack of affordable broadband presents a similar 
        barrier to the development of our rural economy.
            (3) According to the Federal Communications Commission, 53 
        percent of rural Americans lack access to service delivering 
        broadband speeds of 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for 
        uploads.
            (4) High-speed broadband access helps rural communities 
        compete and grow in our digital economy.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that necessary funds should be made 
available to provide universal and affordable broadband access to the 
United States of America with a focus on underserved rural communities.

SEC. 4. OFFICE OF RURAL BROADBAND INITIATIVES.

    (a) In General.--Title VI of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936
