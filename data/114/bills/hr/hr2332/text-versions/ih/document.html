        are produced in the United States.
            (2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any case 
        or category of cases in which the Secretary finds that--

                quality; or
                    (C) inclusion of iron, steel, and manufactured 
                goods produced in the United States will increase the 
                cost of the overall project by more than 25 percent.
            (3) Justifications.--If the Secretary determines that it is 
        necessary to waive the application of paragraph (1) based on a
