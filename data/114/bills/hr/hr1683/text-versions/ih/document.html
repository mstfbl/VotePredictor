                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration 
                   of the United States Coast Guard.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Coast Guard 
Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Coast Guard was founded on August 4, 
        1790, as the Revenue Cutter Service under the United States 
        Department of the Treasury.
            (2) Congress created the Coast Guard on January 28, 1915, 
        by merging the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States 
        Lifesaving Service, was moved to the Department of 
        Transportation in 1967, and on February 25, 2003, became part 
        of the Department of Homeland Security.
            (3) Although the smallest of the uniformed services, today 
        the United States Coast Guard conducts a wide variety of 
        missions to protect the public, the environment, and the United 
        States economic and security interests in any maritime region, 
        including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and 
        inland waterways.
            (4) Every day, the United States Coast Guard plays a broad 
        and important role in homeland security, law enforcement, 
        search and rescue, marine environmental pollution response, and 
        the maintenance of river, intra-coastal and offshore aids to 
        navigation (ATON).
            (5) The United States Coast Guard is our Nation's oldest 
        seagoing military service, staying true to their motto, Semper 
        Paratus or ``Always Ready,'' for 225 years.
            (6) The United States Coast Guard is supported by 57,600 
        Active Duty, Reserve, and Civilian personnel, who in 2013 
        responded to 17,000 search and rescue cases saving 7,400 lives, 
        conducted over 21,000 waterborne patrols of maritime 
        infrastructure and resources, performed 32,500 maritime 
        security response activities (including 21,000 waterborne 
        patrols of critical maritime infrastructure and resources, 
        2,000 escorts of high-capacity passenger vessels, 8,400 
        security boardings in and around U.S. ports), removed $3 
        billion worth of illegal drugs, patrolled 4.5 million miles of 
        maritime borders for immigration enforcement, and maintained 
        49,000 navigation aids ensuring the smooth transit of $1.8 
        trillion worth of goods over 25,000 miles of our Nation's 
        waterways.
            (7) Section 213 of Public Law 108-293 states that ``The 
        Commandant may establish a National Coast Guard Museum, on 
        lands which will be federally owned and administered by the 
        Coast Guard, and are located in New London, Connecticut, at, or 
        in close proximity to, the Coast Guard Academy''.
            (8) The National Coast Guard Museum Association, a 
        nonprofit association dedicated to improve public understanding 
        of the history, service and missions of the Coast Guard, is 
        working with the United States Coast Guard, the City of New 
        London, the State of Connecticut, and a range of local, 
        regional, and national stakeholders to develop, plan and raise 
        capital for the National Coast Guard Museum, to be located in 
        New London, Connecticut.
            (9) The United States Coast Guard is the only military 
        service without a national museum through which to share its 
        history and legacy with the American public.
