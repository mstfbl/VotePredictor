                                 A BILL


 
 To reduce Federal overcriminalization, protect Americans from unjust 
  punishment, and uphold the role of Congress by clarifying mens rea 
 requirements for all Federal criminal offenses, creating an inventory 
 of Federal offenses that carry a criminal penalty, and providing that 
   no rule of the executive branch which may be enforced by criminal 
  penalties can take effect unless a joint resolution of approval is 
                           enacted into law.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Over-Criminalization Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to reduce the size, scope and complexity 
of the Federal criminal code. In order to ensure that honest mistakes 
by individuals who are not morally blameworthy do not result in 
criminal charges, the Act establishes a default criminal state of mind 
requirement for all Federal criminal offenses, and allows a mistake of 
law defense for situations in which the defendant did not know, and a 
reasonable person would not have known, that the action was a crime. 
Currently, Federal crimes, including executive rules that carry 
criminal penalties are scattered throughout the Federal code and 
register. To enable all Americans to access and view Federal crimes, 
the Act requires the creation of a Federal inventory that lists all 
Federal criminal offenses, including agency rules that define criminal 
offenses. To uphold the role of Congress in defining what constitutes a 
Federal crime, the Act holds that no rule of the executive branch 
defining or establishing a criminal offense shall have force or effect 
unless approved by both branches of Congress.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF DEFAULT MENS REA FOR FEDERAL OFFENSES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 1 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 28. Default mens rea requirement
    ``(a) Knowing State of Mind Generally Required.--For the purposes 
of a Federal offense, unless otherwise specifically provided in the 
provision of law defining the offense, the state of mind required for a 
conviction is knowing as to each element of the offense.
    ``(b) Special Rule for Regulatory and Similar Offenses.--In 
addition, in the case of an offense, such as a regulatory offense, 
where a defendant might reasonably be unaware the conduct could be 
criminally punished, the Government must prove the defendant had reason 
to know the defendant's conduct was unlawful.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 1 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following new item:

``28. Establishing a default mens rea for Federal offenses.''.

SEC. 4. REQUIRING AN INVENTORY OF ALL FEDERAL CRIMINAL OFFENSES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 31 of title 28, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 530E. Inventory of Federal criminal offenses
    ``(a) Development and Availability.--
            ``(1) Initially.--Not later than one year after the 
        enactment of this section, the Attorney General shall develop 
        and make available to the public, online and through other 
        appropriate means, an inventory of all Federal criminal 
        offenses, including violations of agency rules that carry 
        criminal penalties.
            ``(2) Updating.--The Attorney General shall update the 
        inventory following the subsequent enactment or amendment (or 
        the creation by agency rulemaking) of any Federal criminal 
        offenses in order to keep the inventory as up to date as 
        practicable.
    ``(b) Prohibition of Prosecution of Non-Inventoried Offenses.--
            ``(1) Generally.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it 
        is a defense against a prosecution for any Federal offense that 
        the offense is not listed in the inventory as required by this 
        section.
            ``(2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) does not apply if--
                    ``(A) the Government demonstrates beyond a 
                reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would have 
                known the conduct that person engaged in was criminal 
                in nature; or
                    ``(B) the conduct of the defendant resulted in an 
                imminent and foreseeable risk of death or bodily injury 
                to another.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 31 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following new item:

``530E. Inventory of Federal criminal offenses.''.

                spending, and the impact of incarceration and other 
                punishments under the rule on communities.

        not take effect prior to the final disposition date for such

this section, each House of Congress shall provide copies of the 
submission to the chairman and ranking member of each standing

legislative days after the referral in one of the Houses of Congress, 
no committee to which a submission is referred under subsection (c) 
reports out, either favorably or unfavorably, a joint resolution 
approving the rule, the committee to which the submission is referred 
is automatically discharged of the resolution of approval.
    ``(e) House of Representatives.--(1) In the House of 
Representatives, after the 15-day period described in subsection (d), 
it is at any time in order for a motion to proceed to the consideration

same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of the joint resolution, and all points of order against 
the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint 
resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a 
motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
to the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the joint 
resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until 
disposed of.
    ``(2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on all 
debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
to not more than 5 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
favoring and those opposing the joint resolution. A motion further to 
limit debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a 
motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in 
order.
    ``(3) In the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of the 
debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a), and a single 
quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance 
with the rules of the Senate, the vote on final passage of the joint 
resolution shall occur.

                as if no joint resolution had been received from the 
                other House; but
                    ``(B) the vote on final passage shall be on the

        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is
