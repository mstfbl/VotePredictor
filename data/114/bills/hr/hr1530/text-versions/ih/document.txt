    (a) In General.--Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended 
by inserting after section 1863 (42 U.S.C. 1395z) the following new 
section:

       ``eligibility for medicare payment for suppliers based on 
                             qualifications

    ``Sec. 1863A. No payment may be made under this part for an item or 
service that is furnished (i) in a State that requires a provider or 
supplier to be licensed in order to furnish such item or service, 
unless the provider or supplier furnishing such item or service 
possesses all applicable licensure from the State, or (ii) in a State 
that does not require a provider or supplier to be licensed in order to 
furnish such item or service, unless the provider or supplier meets all 
applicable qualifications, as established by the Secretary. Applicable 
qualifications means all applicable accreditations, certifications, and 
credentials required under this part for providers and suppliers, 
including the requirements established under section 427 of the 
Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protections Act 
of 2000, as enacted into law by section 1(a)(6) of Public Law 106-554, 
with these requirements to be applicable immediately in accordance with 
that statutory language even in advance of the Secretary issuing 
applicable regulations under this provision, as well as any and all 
applicable regulations as established by the Secretary, this being 
noted inasmuch as issuance of these regulations are approximately 
fourteen years beyond the statutory requirement for their being issued 
in final form by the Secretary, which it is anticipated the Secretary 
will remedy expeditiously.''.
