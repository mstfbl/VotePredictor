                                 AN ACT


 
   To amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit a health care 
practitioner from failing to exercise the proper degree of care in the

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Born-Alive Abortion Survivors 
Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) If an abortion results in the live birth of an infant, 
        the infant is a legal person for all purposes under the laws of 
        the United States, and entitled to all the protections of such 
        laws.
            (2) Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a 
        hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the 
        protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for 
        any person who comes to a hospital, clinic, or other facility 
        for screening and treatment or otherwise becomes a patient 
        within its care.
