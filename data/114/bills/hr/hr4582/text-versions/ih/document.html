                                 A BILL


 
 To exclude striped bass from the anadromous fish doubling requirement 
 in section 3406(b)(1) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Save Our Salmon Act'' or the ``SOS 
Act''.

SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) California is home to many populations of native salmon 
        and steelhead.
            (2) Many of the native salmon and steelhead populations in 
        California are listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
            (3) The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) 
        required a doubling of natural production of Central Valley 
        populations of anadromous fish within 10 years.
            (4) Striped bass are anadromous fish indigenous to the East 
        Coast of the United States and are not native to the State of 
        California.
            (5) Striped bass were included in the CVPIA's fish doubling 
        goal even though they are not a native species.
            (6) Striped bass prey on native salmon and steelhead.
            (7) Predation poses a serious threat to federally protected 
        juvenile salmon and other native fish in California.
            (8) According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
        reducing abundance of striped bass and other non-native 
        predators must be achieved to prevent extinction of Central 
        Valley salmon and steelhead or to prevent the species from 
        declining irreversibly.
            (9) Therefore, the CVPIA's fish-doubling goal for two 
        competing species is contradictory and counterproductive for 
        salmon and steelhead recovery.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF STRIPED BASS.

    Section 3406(b)(1) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act 
(title XXXIV of Public Law 102-575) is amended by inserting ``(except 
striped bass)'' after ``natural production of anadromous fish''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
