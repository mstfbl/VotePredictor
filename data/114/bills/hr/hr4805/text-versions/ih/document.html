                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical 
      Health Act to provide that information held by health care 
clearinghouses is subject to privacy protections that are equivalent to 
   the protections that apply to information held by other types of 
 covered entities under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Patient Access to 
Healthcare Records Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
        of 1996 (``HIPAA''), through certain of its implementing 
        regulations known as the Privacy Rule, protects the health 
        information of enrollees of health plans and other individuals 
        (in this section referred to as ``protected health 
        information'').
            (2) The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to protected health 
        information held by health care providers, plans, and 
        clearinghouses, which are known as ``covered entities''. Such 
        Rule also applies to vendors that perform certain functions for 
        covered entities and thereby come into possession of protected 
        health information. The HIPAA Privacy Rule refers to these 
        vendors as ``business associates''.
            (3) The HIPAA Privacy Rule applies both to the internal use 
        of protected health information by covered entities and their 
        business associates and to the disclosure of such information 
        to other parties.
            (4) Covered entities and their business associates are 
        subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties if they use 
        or disclose protected health information in violation of the 
        HIPAA Privacy Rule.
            (5) Clearinghouses play a unique, central role in the 
        health care system, interacting with both health care providers 
        and plans. Clearinghouses convert information from providers 
        into claims-processing standard electronic formats and then 
        submit the claims to the plans and finally send providers the 
        plan payments.
            (6) Claims and other data held by clearinghouses could be 
        analyzed longitudinally and geographically, providing powerful 
        analytical tools that could benefit the overall health care 
        system and facilitate medical innovation in the 21st Century.
            (7) Clearinghouses are unable to unlock the benefits of 
        such claims and other data because the HIPAA Privacy Rule 
        assigns clearinghouses a dual role. Such clearinghouses are not 
        only covered entities, but are also business associates. The 
        latter role substantially restricts the ability of 
        clearinghouses to analyze claims data.
            (8) Clearinghouses should not be considered business 
        associates and should instead have the same ability to use and 
        disclose health-related data as other types of covered 
        entities.
            (9) Eliminating the business-associate role of 
        clearinghouses would not affect the applicability of the civil 
        and criminal penalties that enforce the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
        Clearinghouses would continue to be subject to such penalties 
        in their role as covered entities.
            (10) In addition to the uses of health-related information 
        that the HIPAA Privacy Rule currently authorizes for covered 
        entities, there are several particular analytical uses that 
        should be authorized specifically for clearinghouses because of 
        the unique benefits that would result from authorizing those 
        uses. Although these particular new analytical uses should be 
        authorized for clearinghouses, the disclosure of health 
        information pursuant to these uses should be subject to the 
        protection principles currently underlying the HIPAA Privacy 
        Rule, including enforcement principles.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN HIPAA-RELATED ACTIVITIES OF HEALTH CARE 
              CLEARINGHOUSES.

the aggregation of such information between covered entities.
    ``(e) Comprehensive Records Per Request of Individual.--For 
purposes of subsection (b)(2), when a health care clearinghouse 
receives a request from an individual for the protected health 
information of the individual, the clearinghouse shall provide to the 
individual a comprehensive record of such information (across health 
care providers and health plans), unless the clearinghouse determines 
in its discretion that providing a comprehensive record is not 
technologically feasible. In preparing such record for the individual, 
the clearinghouse may, with the permission of the individual, purchase 
the protected health care information of the individual from one or 
more other health care clearinghouses (and the cost of such purchase 
may be included in the fee charged to the individual).

functions under this subtitle, part C of title XI of the Social 
Security Act, and the regulations promulgated pursuant to section 
264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 as if the clearinghouse were a business associate. The individuals 
to whom the preceding sentence applies includes individuals with 
respect to whom the sole clearinghouse function is to process or 
facilitate the processing of nonstandard data elements of health 
information into standard data elements.
    ``(g) Transition.--With respect to agreements entered into by a 
health care clearinghouse before the effective date of this section, a 
provision of an agreement that conflicts with this section shall not 
have any legal force or effect. The preceding sentence may not be 
construed as affecting any provision of an agreement that does not 
conflict with this section. A health care clearinghouse shall provide 
notice of this subsection to each entity with which the clearinghouse 
has an agreement that is affected by this subsection.

        agreement that establishes the permitted uses and disclosures 
        of protected health information by the recipient for one or 
        more functions described in subsection (c)(1) and restricts the 
        use and disclosure of the information by the recipient in the 
        same manner as applies under paragraphs (e)(4)(ii)(B) and 
        (e)(4)(ii)(C) (1)-(4) of section 164.514 of title 45, Code of 
        Federal Regulations, but without regard to the references to
