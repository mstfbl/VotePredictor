    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
alien may be naturalized as a citizen of the United States under 
chapter 2 of title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1421 et seq.) until such time as the Director of U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement completes the digitization of all remaining paper-
based fingerprint records for inclusion in the Automated Biometric 
Identification System (IDENT) of the Department of Homeland Security.
    (b) Pending Applications.--Upon the completion of the requirement 
under subsection (a), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, prior 
to naturalizing as a citizen of the United States an alien who has an 
application for naturalization pending on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, review the alien's eligibility for naturalization using the 
updated Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT).
    (c) Revocation of Naturalization.--Section 340 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1451) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(i) In the case that an officer or employee of the Department of

has illegally procured such benefit, or procured such benefit by 
concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation, 
including being subject to a final deportation order, whether under the 
current identity or under another identity of that individual, such 
officer or employee shall prepare an affidavit described in subsection 
(a) and submit such affidavit to the appropriate United States attorney

United States attorney shall institute the proceedings described in 
subsection (a).''.
