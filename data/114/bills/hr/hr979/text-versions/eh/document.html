_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
   To designate a mountain in the John Muir Wilderness of the Sierra 
                   National Forest as ``Sky Point''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Staff Sergeant Sky Mote, USMC, grew up in El Dorado, 
        California.
            (2) Staff Sergeant Mote graduated from Union Mine High 
        School.
            (3) Upon graduation, Staff Sergeant Mote promptly enlisted 
        in the Marine Corps.
            (4) Staff Sergeant Mote spent 9 years serving his country 
        in the United States Marine Corps, including a deployment to 
        Iraq and two deployments to Afghanistan.
            (5) By his decisive actions, heroic initiative, and 
        resolute dedication to duty, Staff Sergeant Mote gave his life 
        to protect fellow Marines on August 10, 2012, by gallantly 
        rushing into action during an attack by a rogue Afghan 
        policeman inside the base perimeter in Helmand province.
            (6) Staff Sergeant Mote was awarded the Navy Cross, a 
        Purple Heart, the Navy-Marine Corps Commendation Medal, a Navy-
        Marine Corps Achievement Medal, two Combat Action Ribbons, and 
        three Good Conduct Medals.
            (7) The Congress of the United States, in acknowledgment of 
        this debt that cannot be repaid, honors Staff Sergeant Mote for 
        his ultimate sacrifice and recognizes his service to his 
        country, faithfully executed to his last, full measure of 
        devotion.
            (8) A presently unnamed peak in the center of Humphrey 
        Basin holds special meaning to the friends and family of Sky 
        Mote, as their annual hunting trips set up camp beneath this 
        point; under the stars, the memories made beneath this rounded 
        peak will be cherished forever.

SEC. 2. SKY POINT.

    (a) Designation.--The mountain in the John Muir Wilderness of the 
Sierra National Forest in California, located at 3715'16.10091"N

    (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, 
record, or other paper of the United States to the mountain described 
in subsection (a) shall be considered to be a reference to ``Sky

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
