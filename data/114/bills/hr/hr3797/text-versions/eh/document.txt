                    (B) Continued applicability of phase i allowance 
                allocations.--In carrying out CSAPR, the Administrator 
                shall provide that, for any compliance period, the 
                allocation (whether through a Federal implementation 
                plan or State implementation plan) of sulfur dioxide 
                allowances for a coal refuse electric utility steam 
                generating unit described in subparagraph (A) is 
                equivalent to the allocation of the unit-specific 
                sulfur dioxide allowance allocation identified for such 
                unit for Phase I, as referenced in the notice entitled 
                ``Availability of Data on Allocations of Cross-State

                Generating Units'' (79 Fed. Reg. 71674 (December 3, 
                2014)).
                    (C) Rules for allowance allocations.--For any 
                compliance period under CSAPR that commences on or 
                after January 1, 2017, any sulfur dioxide allowance 
                allocation provided by the Administrator to a coal 
                refuse electric utility steam generating unit described 
                in subparagraph (A)--
                            (i) shall not be transferable for use by 
                        any other source not located at the same coal 
                        refuse-fired facility as the relevant coal 
                        refuse electric utility steam generating unit;
                            (ii) may be transferable for use by another 
                        source located at the same coal refuse-fired 
                        facility as the relevant coal refuse electric 
                        utility steam generating unit;
                            (iii) may be banked for application to 
                        compliance obligations in future compliance 
                        periods under CSAPR; and
                            (iv) shall be surrendered upon the 
                        permanent cessation of operation of such coal 
                        refuse electric utility steam generating unit.

                    (A) No increase in overall state budget of sulfur 
                dioxide allowance allocations.--For purposes of 
                paragraph (1), the Administrator may not, for any 
                compliance period under CSAPR, increase the total 
                budget of sulfur dioxide allowance allocations for a 
                State in which a unit described in paragraph (1)(A) is 
                located.
                    (B) Compliance periods 2017 through 2020.--For any 
                compliance period under CSAPR that commences on or 
                after January 1, 2017, but before December 31, 2020, 
                the Administrator shall carry out subparagraph (A) by 
                proportionally reducing, as necessary, the unit-
                specific sulfur dioxide allowance allocations from each 
                source that--
                            (i) is located in a State in which a unit 
                        described in paragraph (1)(A) is located;
                            (ii) permanently ceases operation, or 
                        converts its primary fuel source from coal to 
                        natural gas, prior to the relevant compliance 
                        period; and
                            (iii) otherwise receives an allocation of 
                        sulfur dioxide allowances under CSAPR for such 
                        period.
