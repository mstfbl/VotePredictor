SEC. 2. SUPPLEMENTAL BYRNE JAG AWARD FOR STATES REPORTING DUI 
              CONVICTIONS.

    (a) Supplemental Award.--To the extent and in the amount provided 
in advance in appropriations Acts, and in addition to the amounts 
otherwise allocated under subpart 1 of part E of title I of the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.), 
the Attorney General shall award to a State, for a fiscal year, a 
supplemental award of funds equal to 5 percent of the allocation to 
that State for that fiscal year under section 505(a)(1)(A) of such 
subpart. Such supplemental award shall be treated as provided under 
section 505(b)(1).
    (b) Eligibility.--To be eligible for a supplemental award under 
subsection (a), a State shall, in the prior fiscal year--
            (1) maintain an effective reporting rate for DUI 
        convictions of not less than 90 percent; and
            (2) have in effect a law or policy requiring that a DUI 
        conviction shall be taken into account, for a period of not 
        less than 10 years after the date on which such conviction is 
        entered, for purposes of any sentencing enhancement under the 
        criminal law of that State.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION.

    In this Act:
            (1) The term ``DUI conviction'' means, in the case of a 
        State, a criminal conviction under the law of that State for 
        operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a drug or 
        alcohol.
            (2) The term ``effective reporting rate for DUI 
        convictions'' means, in the case of a State, the percentage of 
        DUI convictions entered in that State for a fiscal year that 
        the State has reported to the Attorney General. For purposes of 
        this paragraph, a DUI conviction shall only be considered to be 
        reported if that report is made not later than 30 days after 
        the date such conviction is entered.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

out this Act $9,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 through 2021.
