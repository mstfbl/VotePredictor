                      TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Corps of Engineers constructs projects for the 
        purposes of navigation, flood control, beach erosion control 
        and shoreline protection, hydroelectric power, recreation, 
        water supply, environmental protection, restoration, and 
        enhancement, and fish and wildlife mitigation.
            (2) The Corps of Engineers is the primary Federal provider 
        of outdoor recreation in the United States.
            (3) The Corps of Engineers owns and operates more than 600 
        dams.
            (4) The Corps of Engineers operates and maintains 12,000 
        miles of commercial inland navigation channels.
            (5) The Corps of Engineers manages the dredging of more 
        than 200,000,000 cubic yards of construction and maintenance 
        dredge material annually.
            (6) The Corps of Engineers maintains 926 coastal, Great 
        Lakes, and inland harbors.
            (7) The Corps of Engineers restores, creates, enhances, or 
        preserves tens of thousands of acres of wetlands annually under 
        the Corps' Regulatory Program.
            (8) The Corps of Engineers provides a total water supply 
        storage capacity of 329,200,000 acre-feet in major Corps lakes.
            (9) The Corps of Engineers owns and operates 24 percent of 
        United States hydropower capacity or 3 percent of the total 
        electric capacity of the United States.
            (10) The Corps of Engineers supports Army and Air Force 
        installations.
            (11) The Corps of Engineers provides technical and 
        construction support to more than 100 countries.
            (12) The Corps of Engineers manages an Army military 
        construction program that carried out approximately 
        $44,600,000,000 in construction projects (the largest 
        construction effort since World War II) between 2006 and 2013.
            (13) The Corps of Engineers researches and develops 
        technologies to protect the environment and enhance quality of 
        life in the United States.
            (14) The legislation for authorizing Corps of Engineers 
        projects is the Water Resources Development Act and, between 
        1986 and 2000, Congress typically enacted an authorization bill 
        every 2 years.
            (15) Since 2000, only 3 Water Resources Development Acts 
        have been enacted.
            (16) In 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development 
        Act of 2014 was enacted, which accelerated the infrastructure 
        project delivery process, fostered fiscal responsibility, and 
        strengthened water transportation networks to promote the 
        competitiveness, prosperity, and economic growth of the United 
        States.
            (17) Section 1001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282c) requires typical 
        Corps of Engineers project feasibility studies to be completed 
        in 3 years.
            (18) Section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d) requires the Corps of 
        Engineers to submit annually a Report to Congress on Future 
        Water Resources Development, which ensures projects and 
        activities proposed at the local, regional, and State levels 
        are considered for authorization.
            (19) Passing Water Resources Development Acts on a routine 
        basis enables Congress to exercise oversight, ensures the Corps 
        of Engineers maintains an appropriately sized portfolio, 
        prevents project backlog, and keeps United States 
        infrastructure competitive.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the missions and authorities of the Corps of Engineers 
        are a unique function that benefits all Americans;
            (2) water resources development projects are critical to 
        maintaining economic prosperity, national security, and 
        environmental protection;
            (3) Congress has required timely delivery of project and 
        study authorization proposals from non-Federal project sponsors 
        and the Corps of Engineers; and
            (4) Congress should consider a Water Resources Development 
        Act at least once every Congress.

SEC. 130. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON THE ANNUAL REPORT PROCESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress plays a central role in identifying, 
        prioritizing, and authorizing vital water resources 
        infrastructure activities throughout the United States.
            (2) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 
        (Public Law 113-121) established a new and transparent process 
        to review and prioritize the water resources development 
        activities of the Corps of Engineers with strong congressional 
        oversight.
            (3) Section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and 
        Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d) requires the 
        Secretary to develop and submit to Congress each year a Report 
        to Congress on Future Water Resources Development and, as part 
        of the annual report process, to--
                    (A) publish a notice in the Federal Register that 
                requests from non-Federal interests proposed 
                feasibility studies and proposed modifications to 
                authorized water resources development projects and 
                feasibility studies for inclusion in the report; and
                    (B) review the proposals submitted and include in 
                the report those proposed feasibility studies and 
                proposed modifications that meet the criteria for 
                inclusion established under section 7001.
            (4) Congress will use the information provided in the 
        annual Report to Congress on Future Water Resources Development 
        to determine authorization needs and priorities for purposes of 
        water resources development legislation.
            (5) To ensure that Congress can gain a thorough 
        understanding of the water resources development needs and 
        priorities of the United States, it is important that the 
        Secretary take sufficient steps to ensure that non-Federal 
        interests are made aware of the new annual report process, 
        including the need for non-Federal interests to submit 
        proposals during the Secretary's annual request for proposals 
        in order for such proposals to be eligible for consideration by 
        Congress.
    (b) Dissemination of Process Information.--The Secretary shall 
develop, support, and implement education and awareness efforts for 
non-Federal interests with respect to the annual Report to Congress on 
Future Water Resources Development required under section 7001 of the 
Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2282d), 
including efforts to--
            (1) develop and disseminate technical assistance materials, 
        seminars, and guidance on the annual process as it relates to 
        non-Federal interests;
            (2) provide written notice to previous and potential non-
        Federal interests and local elected officials on the annual 
        process and on opportunities to address local water resources 
        challenges through the missions and authorities of the Corps of 
        Engineers;
            (3) issue guidance for non-Federal interests to assist such 
        interests in developing proposals for water resources 
        development projects that satisfy the requirements of section 
        7001; and
            (4) provide, at the request of a non-Federal interest, 
        assistance with researching and identifying existing project 
        authorizations and Corps of Engineers decision documents.
