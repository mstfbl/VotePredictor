    (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) That, as expressed in the Water Supply Act of 1958, 
        Congress has recognized the primary responsibilities of the 
        States and local interests in developing water supplies for 
        domestic, municipal, industrial, and other purposes, and that 
        the Federal Government should participate and cooperate in 
        these projects.
            (2) That there is a long and robust legal precedent of 
        Federal deference to State primacy in water law and the legal 
        system that States establish for resolving disputes over water 
        use, with the Supreme Court finding in Kansas v. Colorado that 
        ``Congress cannot enforce either rule upon any state'' in 
        matters of the right regulation of water rights.
            (3) That, as established in the Proclamation of a State of 
        Emergency issued by the Governor of the State of California on 
        January 17, 2014, California is experiencing record dry 
        conditions, all regions of the State are impacted by the 
        drought, and these extremely dry conditions have persisted 
        since 2012 and are likely to persist beyond this year and more 
        regularly into the future.
            (4) That the State of California is not alone in the 
        prospects for long-term drought, and that the entire American 
        West and Southwest are facing forecasts of prolonged droughts 
        that will leave States facing major water shortages and 
        catastrophic wildfires.
            (5) That the prolonged period of drought in the American 
        West has also occurred with higher temperatures throughout the 
        State of California, reducing snowpack and leading to what 
        climate scientists conclude may be the most severe drought in 
        over 1,200 years.
            (6) That the Colorado River has been under drought 
        conditions since 2000, and that the chances of a 
        ``megadrought'' striking the Southwest and central Great Plains 
        are on the rise according to forecasts from climate scientists.
            (7) That the United States should utilize all existing 
        authorities and resources made available by the Agricultural 
        Act of 2014, that over $500 million in assistance has already 
        been dedicated to assisting agricultural users and rural 
        communities in California and other drought-impacted areas, and 
        that the United States Department of Agriculture should 
        continue to prioritize such assistance to bring relief to 
        drought-impacted areas.
            (8) That this drought emergency requires an immediate and 
        credible response that respects State, local, and tribal law, 
        and that the policies that respond to the drought should not 
        pit State against State, region against region, or stakeholders 
        against one another.
            (9) That Federal agencies should continue to operate the 
        Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project in California in 
        compliance with all Federal and State laws, including 
        biological opinions, while working with the State to maximize 
        operational flexibility in order to deliver as much water as 
        reasonably possible to drought-impacted areas and minimize the 
        harm suffered by fish and wildlife as a result of the drought.
            (10) That Congress recognizes the range of separate, 
        distinct Federal agencies with authorities and resources that 
        play a role in water supply, including treatment and 
        remediation of groundwater, surface water storage, water 
        recycling and reuse, and other clean water infrastructure, and 
        that to avoid duplication and ensure the efficiency and 
        effectiveness of these various Federal roles, there is a need 
        for improved coordination, streamlining, and collaboration, 
        both among Federal agencies and with drought-impacted States 
        and localities.
            (11) That it is the policy of the United States to respect 
        California's coequal goals, established by the Delta Reform Act 
        of 2009, of providing a more reliable water supply for 
        California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta 
        ecosystem, and that these coequal goals shall be achieved in a 
        manner that protects and enhances the unique cultural, 
        recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the 
        Delta as an evolving place.
            (12) That the State of California, in CA Water Code Section 
        85021, has established a policy to reduce reliance on the Delta 
        in meeting California's future water supply needs through a 
        statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, 
        conservation, and water use efficiency, that California law 
        directs each region that depends on water from the Delta 
        watershed to improve its regional self-reliance for water 
        through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, 
        advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply 
        projects, and improved regional coordination of local and 
        regional water supply efforts, and that it is the intent of 
        Congress to ensure that Federal programs, policies, and 
        investments respect and compliment, and do not undermine or 
        conflict with, California's policy of reducing reliance on 
        Delta diversions.
            (13) That the Reclamation Fund was established in 1902 with 
        the expressed purpose of providing for the construction and 
        maintenance of water infrastructure for the economic 
        development of the western States and territories, with 
        revenues deposited into the fund out of public land sales 
        within these western States and territories.
            (14) That since 1902, the Reclamation Fund has been 
        supplemented with additional revenues from Federal water 
        resources development and mineral and natural resource leases 
        on Federal lands, such that the surplus within the Reclamation 
        Fund now exceeds $10 billion.
            (15) That the Reclamation Fund represents a transfer of a 
        portion of receipts from Federal lands and Federal natural 
        resources in the West back to the West for water development, 
        and that in this time of drought the Reclamation Fund's surplus 
        should be used to assist the West in meeting its water needs 
        for public health and safety, for expanding water recycling, 
        reuse, and reclamation, for meeting the emergency needs of 
        communities impacted by the drought, and for developing long 
        term solutions to meet the impacts of climate change on this 
        already arid region of the country.

           Subtitle C--Innovative Stormwater Capture Program

SEC. 251. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Innovative Stormwater 
Infrastructure Act of 2015''.

SEC. 252. PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) many water resources in the United States are 
        declining, particularly in urban and agricultural areas;
            (2) the decline of water resources is the result of--
                    (A) an increase in population, water consumption, 
                and impermeable surfaces; and
                    (B) the negative effects of urbanization, 
                commercial and industrial activities, and increasing 
                and persistent droughts;
            (3) an October 2008 study by the National Research Council 
        found that some of the benefits of innovative stormwater 
        control infrastructure include--
                    (A) increased water supplies;
                    (B) the creation of jobs;
                    (C) cost savings; and
                    (D) a reduction of stormwater runoff, surface water 
                discharge, stormwater pollution, and stormwater flows 
                to protect and restore natural hydrology, meeting local 
                conditions to the maximum extent feasible; and
            (4) capturing stormwater runoff in urban and suburban areas 
        of the State of California can increase water supplies by over 
        600,000 acre-feet annually, and that similar benefits are 
        achievable in the urban and suburban areas of other States.

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Restoring America's Watersheds 
Act of 2015''.

SEC. 302. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Watershed health and effective headwaters management 
        can have multiple benefits for water supply reliability, water 
        quality, and ecosystems.
            (2) Investments to restore meadows, forests, and watersheds 
        will improve their critical hydrological functions and reduce 
        wildfire impacts.
            (3) Proper ecosystem restoration could increase groundwater 
        storage by 50,000 to 500,000 acre-feet per year just within the 
        National Forest System lands in the Sierra bioregion of the 
        State of California.
            (4) Improved headwaters management would have a similarly 
        significant impact on groundwater storage within National 
        Forest System lands across the western States.
            (5) Source watersheds are recognized and defined as an 
        integral part of federally funded water systems.

    Subtitle C--Reclamation Projects for Renewable Energy To Reduce 
                            Evaporation Loss

SEC. 320. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) evaporative loss along Bureau of Reclamation 
        reservoirs, canals, and other conveyance systems reduces the 
        quantity and reliability of water deliveries;
            (2) drought and extreme aridity from changing weather 
        patterns will contribute to increased evaporative loss in the 
        future; and
            (3) existing Central Valley Project operations assume a 
        conveyance loss for evaporation and seepage south of the Delta 
        of 150,000 acre-feet annually.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to expand investments 
in infrastructure for Bureau of Reclamation reservoirs, canals, and 
other conveyance systems, that will provide shade, reduce evaporative 
loss, and increase water supplies in the arid western States.

SEC. 324. ROYALTIES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall require as a term and 
condition of any lease issued under section 323, the payment of a 
royalty. The Secretary shall establish such royalty pursuant to a 
rulemaking. The royalty shall be a percentage of the gross proceeds 
from the sale of electricity produced on covered land that is the 
subject of such lease, at a rate that--
            (1) encourages production of solar or wind energy;
            (2) ensures a fair return to the public comparable to the 
        return that would be obtained on State or private land; and
            (3) encourages the maximum energy generation while 
        disturbing the least quantity of covered land and other natural 
        resources, including water.
    (b) Consideration.--In establishing the royalty under subsection 
(a), the Secretary shall consider the relative capacity factors of wind 
and solar energy projects.
    (c) Exclusive Payment on Sale of Electricity.--The royalty under 
subsection (a) shall be the only rent, royalty, or similar payment to 
the Federal Government required with respect to the sale of electricity 
produced under a lease issued under section 323.
    (d) Royalty Relief.--The Secretary may reduce the royalty rate 
established under subsection (a) if the holder of a lease issued under 
this Act shows by clear and convincing evidence that--
            (1) collection of the full royalty would unreasonably 
        burden energy generation on covered land that is the subject of 
        the lease; and
            (2) the royalty reduction is in the public interest.
    (e) Enforcement.--
            (1) Auditing system.--The Secretary shall establish a 
        comprehensive inspection, collection, fiscal, and production 
        accounting and auditing system--
                    (A) to accurately determine royalties, interest, 
                fines, penalties, fees, deposits, and other payments 
                owed under this subtitle; and
                    (B) to collect and account for the payments in a 
                timely manner.
            (2) Applicability of federal oil and royalty management act 
        of 1982.--The provisions of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
        Management Act of 1982 (30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (including the 
        civil and criminal enforcement provisions of such Act) shall 
        apply to leases issued under this subtitle with respect to wind 
        and solar energy projects in the same manner as such provisions 
        apply to oil and gas leases.
    (f) Report on Royalties.--Not later than 5 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act and every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary shall 
submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate 
and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives 
a report consisting of a review of the collections and impacts of the 
royalties and fees collected under this subtitle, including--
            (1) the total revenues received (by category) on an annual 
        basis as royalties from wind and solar energy development and 
        production (specified by energy source) on covered land;
            (2) whether the revenues received for the development of 
        wind and solar energy development are comparable to the 
        revenues received for similar development on State or private 
        land;
            (3) any impact on the development of wind and solar energy 
        on covered land as a result of the royalties; and
            (4) any recommendations with respect to changes in Federal 
        law (including regulations) relating to the amount or method of 
        collection (including auditing, compliance, and enforcement) of 
        the royalties.
    (g) Regulations.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to 
carry out this section.
