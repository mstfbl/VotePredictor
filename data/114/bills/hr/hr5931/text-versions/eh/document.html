_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
 To provide for the prohibition on cash payments to the Government of 
                     Iran, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments 
to Iran Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since 1979, when it held more than 50 United States 
        citizens for 444 days, Iran has repeatedly held United States 
        citizens hostage.
            (2) Presidential Policy Directive 30 issued by President 
        Barack Obama on June 24, 2015, states that ``It is United 
        States policy to deny hostage-takers the benefits of ransom, 
        prisoner releases, policy changes, or other acts of 
        concession.''.
            (3) On January 17, 2016, the President announced that Iran 
        would release several United States citizens while the United 
        States would grant clemency to and release seven Iranian 
        nationals serving sentences or awaiting trial in the United 
        States for serious crimes.
            (4) Senior officials of the Department of State have 
        acknowledged that these United States citizens were released as 
        part of a ``prisoner swap'' and Iranian negotiators reportedly 
        asked for a cash payment.
            (5) On January 17, 2016, the President also announced that 
        ``The United States and Iran are now settling a longstanding 
        Iranian government claim against the United States 
        Government.''.
            (6) The overall amount of the settlement is approximately 
        $1,700,000,000.
            (7) Subsequent reports revealed that $400,000,000 of this 
        $1,700,000,000 settlement was secretly flown to Iran, in cash, 
        simultaneously with the release of these United States 
        citizens.
            (8) One of the United States citizens released that night, 
        Pastor Saeed Abedini, has stated that Iranian officials 
        explained a delay in their departure was due to the status of 
        another plane.
            (9) Senior officials at the National Security Division of 
        the Department of Justice reportedly objected to the 
        $400,000,000 cash payment, warning that Iran would see it as a 
        ransom.
            (10) On August 18, 2016, a Department of State spokesman 
        admitted that the $400,000,000 cash payment was ``leverage'' to 
        gain the release of Americans held hostage by Iran.
            (11) Iranian State Television quoted General Mohammad Reza 
        Naghdi, commander of the Basij militia, as claiming ``Taking 
        this much money back was in return for the release of the 
        American spies.''.
            (12) According to Presidential Policy Directive 30, the 
        United States policy against paying ransom and releasing 
        prisoners ``protects United States nationals and strengthens 
        national security by removing a key incentive for hostage-
        takers to target United States nationals, thereby interrupting 
        the vicious cycle of hostage-takings, and by helping to deny 
        terrorists and other malicious actors the money, personnel, and 
        other resources they need to conduct attacks against the United 
        States, its nationals, and its interests.''.
            (13) Since the United States released Iranians serving 
        sentences or awaiting trial in the United States for serious 
        crimes and provided Iran with $400,000,000 in cash, Iran has 
        taken several more United States citizens hostage.
            (14) On August 22, 2016, the Department of State issued an 
        ``Iran Travel Warning'' noting that ``Iranian authorities 
        continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, 
        particularly Iranian-Americans, including students, 
        journalists, business travelers, and academics, on charges 
        including espionage and posing a threat to national 
        security.''.
            (15) The Government of the United States has designated 
        Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and a 
        jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern since 2011.
            (16) The Department of State's most recent Country Reports 
        on Terrorism makes clear that ``Iran continued its terrorist-
        related activity in 2015, including support for Hizballah, 
        Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza, and various groups in 
        Iraq and throughout the Middle East.''.
            (17) In announcing Iran's designation as a jurisdiction of 
        primary money laundering concern, the Department of the 
        Treasury made clear that ``any and every financial transaction 
        with Iran poses grave risk of supporting'' Iran's ongoing 
        illicit activities, including terrorism.
            (18) On March 17, 2016, the Department of State 
        acknowledged in a letter to Congress that there remain some 
        ``large claims'' pending before the Iran-United States Claims 
        Tribunal, ``many of which are against the United States''.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States Government not to pay 
ransom or release prisoners for the purpose of securing the release of 
United States citizens taken hostage abroad.
