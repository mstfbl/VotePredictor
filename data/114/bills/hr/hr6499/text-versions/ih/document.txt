who fulfills the requirements of section 3632 may file a petition under 
this subchapter to expunge the record of such conviction.
    ``(b) Definition of Nonviolent Offense.--In this subchapter, the

use of a weapon or violence and which did not actually involve violence 
in its commission.

subchapter unless, before filing a petition under this subchapter, such 
individual--
            ``(1) has never been convicted of a violent offense 
        (including an offense under State law that would be a violent 
        offense if it were Federal) and has never been convicted of a 
        nonviolent offense other than the one for which expungement is 
        sought;
            ``(2) has fulfilled all requirements of the sentence of the 
        court in which conviction was obtained, including completion of 
        any term of imprisonment or period of probation, meeting all 
        conditions of a supervised release, and paying all fines;
            ``(3) has remained free from dependency on or abuse of 
        alcohol or a controlled substance a minimum of 1 year and has 
        been rehabilitated, to the satisfaction of the court referred

in the court in which the conviction was obtained. A copy of the

for the district in which the conviction sought to be expunged was 
obtained. Not later than 60 days after receipt of such petition, the 
United States Attorney may submit written recommendations to the court 
and notify the petitioner of that recommendation.
    ``(b) Court-Ordered Expungement.--The court, after consideration of 
evidence submitted by the petitioner in support of the petition and any 
evidence submitted by the Government in support of objections it may 
have to granting the petition, shall rule on the petition. In making 
that ruling, the court, after determining whether the petitioner meets 
the eligibility requirements of this subchapter, shall weigh the 
interests of the petitioner against the best interests of justice and 
public safety.
``Sec. 3634. Effect of expungement
    ``(a) In General.--An order granting expungement under this 
subchapter shall restore the individual concerned, in the contemplation 
of the law, to the status such individual occupied before the arrest or 
institution of criminal proceedings for the crime that was the subject 
of the expungement.
    ``(b) No Disqualification; Statements.--After an order granting 
expungement of any individual's criminal records under this subchapter, 
such individual shall not be required to divulge information pertaining 
to the expunged conviction and the fact that such individual has been 
convicted of the criminal offense concerned shall not--
            ``(1) operate as a disqualification of such individual to 
        pursue or engage in any lawful activity, occupation, or 
        profession; and
            ``(2) be held under any provision of law guilty of perjury, 
        false answering, or making a false statement by reason of his 
        failure to recite or acknowledge such arrest or institution of 
        criminal proceedings, or results thereof, in response to an 
        inquiry made of him for any purpose.
    ``(c) Records Expunged or Sealed.--Upon order of expungement, all 
official law enforcement and court records, including all references to 
such person's arrest for the offense, the institution of criminal 
proceedings against him, and the results thereof, except publicly 
available court opinions or briefs on appeal, shall be expunged (in the 
case of nontangible records) or gathered together and sealed (in the 
case of tangible records).
    ``(d) Record of Disposition To Be Retained.--A nonpublic record of 
a disposition or conviction that is the subject of an expungement order

records and only for the purposes set forth in subsection (b) of this 
section.

than one year, or both.
``Sec. 3636. Reversal of expunged records
