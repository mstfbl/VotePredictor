                                 A BILL


 
 To establish the Freedom Riders National Historical Park in Anniston, 
Alabama, as a unit of the National Park System, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom Riders National Historical 
Park Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    Congress finds that on May 4, 1961, a Greyhound bus traveling from 
Atlanta, Georgia, to Alabama made a routine stop at the Anniston 
Greyhound station. When the bus stopped in Anniston, Alabama, it was 
violently attacked by a mob at the Greyhound bus station. As the 
Freedom Riders bus attempted to continue down the highway it was 
attacked again and broke down. A fire bomb was thrown inside the bus. 
The group was able to escape the bus and separate transportation had to 
be arranged for their continued travel. The violent confrontations the 
Freedom Riders faced demonstrated to the Nation the struggle for 
equality and justice. Their brave effort was part of the courageous 
struggle of the Civil Rights movement.
