                                 A BILL


 
  To adjust the eastern boundary of the Whychus-Deschutes Wilderness 
  Study Area in the State of Oregon to facilitate fire prevention and 
response activities to protect adjacent private property, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Crooked River Ranch is an unincorporated community 
        with a population of 5,000 residents.
            (2) The current lands located adjacent to Crooked River 
        Ranch are managed by the Bureau of Land Management and are 
        classified as a Wilderness Study Area.
            (3) There is currently only one entrance/exit to the 
        Crooked River Ranch.
            (4) Jefferson County and Crooked River Ranch have 
        determined that the Wilderness Study Area lands are in the 
        highest risk category for exposure to devastating wildfire due 
        to overstocked juniper stands under the federally mandated and 
        locally promulgated Jefferson County Community Wildfire 
        Protection Plan (CWPP).
            (5) The current Wilderness Study Area classification 
        prevents mechanical fire prevention activities within the 
        overstocked juniper stands.
            (6) Advancing this proposed legislation will greatly 
        enhance the life and safety of people and property by reducing 
        the extreme fire threat to these lands.

SEC. 3. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, WHYCHUS-DESCHUTES WILDERNESS STUDY AREA, 
              OREGON.

    (a) Boundary Adjustment Required.--The Secretary of the Interior 
shall adjust the eastern boundary of the Whychus-Deschutes Wilderness 
Study Area in the State of Oregon to exclude approximately 832 acres, 
as depicted on the map entitled ``Whychus-Deschutes Wilderness Study 
Area'' and dated December 2015, in order to facilitate fire prevention 
and response activities on the excluded public lands and adjacent 
private property.
    (b) Effect of Exclusion.--Effective on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the public lands to be excluded from the Whychus-Deschutes 
Wilderness Study Area pursuant to subsection (a) are no longer subject 
to section 603(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 
(43 U.S.C. 1782(c)).
