and Exchange Commission shall propose, and not later than the end of 
the 120-day period beginning on such date, the Commission shall adopt, 
upon such terms, conditions, or requirements as the Commission may 
determine necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the 
protection of investors, and for the promotion of capital formation, 
revisions to section 230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, 
to provide that a covered investment fund research report--
            (1) shall be deemed, for purposes of sections 2(a)(10) and 
        5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, not to constitute an offer 
        for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of 
        an offering pursuant to a registration statement that the 
        issuer proposes to file, or has filed, or that is effective, 
        even if the broker or dealer is participating or will 
        participate in the registered offering of the covered 
        investment fund's securities; and
            (2) shall be deemed to satisfy the conditions of subsection 
        (a)(1) or (a)(2) of section 230.139 of title 17, Code of 
        Federal Regulations, or any successor provisions, for purposes 
        of the Commission's rules and regulations under the Federal 
        securities laws and the rules of any self-regulatory 
        organization.
    (b) Implementation of Safe Harbor.--In implementing the safe harbor 
pursuant to subsection (a), the Commission shall--
            (1) not, in the case of a covered investment fund with a 
        class of securities in substantially continuous distribution, 
        condition the safe harbor on whether the broker's or dealer's 
        publication or distribution of a covered investment fund 
        research report constitutes such broker's or dealer's 
        initiation or reinitiation of research coverage on such covered 
        investment fund or its securities;
            (2) not--
                    (A) require the covered investment fund to have 
                been registered as an investment company under the 
                Investment Company Act of 1940 or subject to the 
                reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the 
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for any period 
                exceeding twelve months; or
                    (B) impose a minimum float provision exceeding that 
                referenced in subsection (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(i) of section 
                230.139 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations;
            (3) provide that a self-regulatory organization may not 
        maintain or enforce any rule that would--
                    (A) condition the ability of a member to publish or 
                distribute a covered investment fund research report on 
                whether the member is also participating in a 
                registered offering or other distribution of any 
                securities of such covered investment fund;
                    (B) condition the ability of a member to 
                participate in a registered offering or other 
                distribution of securities of a covered investment fund 
                on whether the member has published or distributed a 
                covered investment fund research report about such 
                covered investment fund or its securities; or
                    (C) require the filing of a covered investment fund 
                research report with such self-regulatory organization; 
                and
            (4) provide that a covered investment fund research report 
        shall not be subject to sections 24(b) or 34(b) of the 
        Investment Company Act of 1940 or the rules and regulations 
        thereunder.

        Federal securities laws; or
            (2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to 
        examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with 
        such member's publication or distribution of a covered
