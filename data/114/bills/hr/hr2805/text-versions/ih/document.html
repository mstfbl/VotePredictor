                                 A BILL


 
          To address prescription opioid abuse and heroin use.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse 
Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) 
        declares that many controlled substances have a useful and 
        legitimate medical purpose and are necessary to maintain the 
        health and general welfare of the people of the United States.
            (2) Health care professionals, medical experts, 
        researchers, and scientists have found pain to be a major 
        national health problem.
            (3) The responsible treatment of pain is a high priority 
        for our Nation and the needs of individuals with pain must be 
        taken into careful consideration when taking steps to prevent 
        prescription drug misuse and abuse.
            (4) When no longer needed or wanted for legitimate pain 
        management or health treatment, prescription opioids are 
        susceptible to diversion. Prescription opioids also may be 
        abused by individuals who were not prescribed such drugs, or 
        misused by individuals not taking such drugs as directed.
            (5) Approximately 4 out of 5 new heroin users report that 
        they became addicted to prescription opioids before they used 
        heroin for the first time.
            (6) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 
        heroin attaches to the same brain cell receptors as 
        prescription opioids.
            (7) The low cost and high purity of currently available 
        heroin has contributed to an increase in heroin use across the 
        United States.
            (8) More people are using heroin, and are using heroin at a 
        younger age. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports 
        that new heroin users numbered 142,000 in 2010, and increased 
        to 178,000 in 2011. In 2011, the average age at first use among 
        heroin abusers between 12 and 49 years was 22.1 years. In 2009, 
        the average age at first use among heroin abusers between 12 
        and 49 years was 25.5 years.
            (9) According to the Department of Health and Human 
        Services, heroin use nationwide rose 79 percent between 2007 
        and 2012.
            (10) Deaths from heroin overdose have significantly 
        increased in communities across the United States. According to 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of 
        deaths involving heroin almost tripled between 2010 and 2013. 
        From 2010 to 2013, the number of heroin deaths rose from 3,036 
        to 8,257.
            (11) The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant 
        Program under part E of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control 
        and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3750 et seq.) is 
        critical to fighting the prescription opioid abuse and heroin 
        use epidemics, and should be reauthorized and fully funded.
