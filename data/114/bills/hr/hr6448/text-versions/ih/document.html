SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) America's native fish, wildlife, and plant species are 
        part of our rich natural heritage and an important legacy to 
        pass on to future generations.
            (2) Populations of many native fish, wildlife, and plant 
        species in the United States are declining. Scientists estimate 
        that one in five animal and plant species in the United States 
        is at risk of extinction and many species are declining in 
        numbers.
            (3) One of the greatest threats to the survival and 
        diversity of many native fish, wildlife, and plant species in 
        the United States is the loss, degradation, fragmentation, and 
        obstructions of their natural habitats.
            (4) The conservation of landscape corridors and hydrologic 
        connectivity, where native fish, wildlife, and plant species 
        and ecological processes can transition from one habitat to 
        another, is critical to conserving native biodiversity and 
        ensuring resiliency against impacts from a range of stressors.
            (5) Climate change is a significant threat to native fish, 
        wildlife, and plants. Conserving, restoring, and establishing 
        new ecological connections to facilitate the shift of species 
        into more suitable habitat is a key climate change adaptation 
        strategy.
            (6) Protecting landscape corridors and hydrologic 
        connectivity is a broadly accepted strategy to conserving 
        native fish, wildlife, and plant species and ensuring ecosystem 
        resilience, and it is typically one of the first steps in 
        restoration and recovery planning. For example, States have 
        recognized the importance of connectivity in the Western 
        Governors' Association policy resolution, ``Protecting Wildlife 
        Migration Corridors and Crucial Wildlife Habitat in the West'', 
        and the Conference of New England Governors and Eastern 
        Canadian Premiers' resolution recognizing the importance of 
        ecological connectivity for the adaptability and resilience of 
        their region's ecosystems, biodiversity, and human communities 
        in the face of climate change. The United States Fish and 
        Wildlife Service's Strategic Plan for Responding to 
        Accelerating Climate Change also acknowledges that ``processes 
        such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, natural 
        disturbance cycles, predator-prey relations, and others must be 
        part of the natural landscapes we seek to maintain or restore. 
        These processes are likely to function more optimally in 
        landscapes composed of large habitat blocks connected by well-
        placed corridors.''. The Department of the Interior's Public 
        Land Policy for Implementing Mitigation at the Landscape-Scale 
        includes ``protecting and restoring core, unfragmented habitat 
        areas, and the key linkages among them.''. Federal and State 
        policies continue to be developed to address the importance of 
        conserving fish, wildlife, and plant corridors and ecological 
        connectivity.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL WILDLIFE CORRIDORS SYSTEM.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established a National Wildlife 
Corridors System to provide for the conservation and restoration of 
habitats that support a diversity of ecologically associated native 
fish, wildlife, and plant species in the United States, including 
species protected under Federal law, that have experienced or may in 
the future experience habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, or 
obstructions of connectivity.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the System is--
            (1) to provide long-term habitat connectivity for native 
        fish, wildlife, and plant species for migration, dispersal, 
        adaptation to climate and other environmental change, and 
        genetic exchange;
            (2) to restore ecological processes that have been 
        disrupted by habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, or 
        obstructions; and
            (3) to facilitate coordinated landscape- and seascape-scale 
        connectivity planning and management across jurisdictions.
    (c) Components.--The System shall consist of National Wildlife 
Corridors that are designated as part of the System by statute, 
rulemaking, or Federal management plan issuance, revision, or 
amendment.
    (d) Strategy.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall 
        issue a strategy for the effective development of the National 
        Wildlife Corridors System that will ensure achievement of the 
        purpose of the System, including consideration of connectivity 
        needs with respect to non-Federal lands and waters, achievement 
        of effective coordination regarding Corridors spanning multiple 
        jurisdictions, and an approximate development timeline. The 
        scope of Corridors to be designated may vary according to the 
        habitat needs of individual or ecologically associated native 
        fish, wildlife, and plant species.
            (2) Consultation and coordination.--The Secretary shall 
        develop the strategy--
                    (A) in consultation with the Secretary of 
                Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary 
                of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation; and
                    (B) in coordination with States, tribes, and 
                existing landscape- and seascape-scale partnerships, 
                including the National Fish Habitat Partnership, 
                National Ocean Policy regional planning bodies, Climate 
                Science Centers of the Department of the Interior, and 
                the Landscape Conservation Cooperative Network.

    (f) Coordination and Cooperation.--
            (1) In general.--To the maximum extent practicable and 
        consistent with applicable law, each Secretary shall coordinate 
        designation of National Wildlife Corridors with other relevant 
        Federal departments and agencies, affected States, including 
        State fish and wildlife agencies and other State agencies 
        responsible for managing natural resources, tribes, local 
        governments, private landowners, and nongovernmental 
        organizations engaged in conservation of native fish, wildlife, 
        and plant species.
            (2) Identification of supporting non-federal land and 
        water.--In conjunction with processes to designate National 
        Wildlife Corridors, each Secretary may identify, in 
        consultation with affected States, tribes, local governments, 
        private landowners and nongovernmental organizations engaged in 
        conservation of native fish, wildlife, and plant species, non-
        Federal lands and waters that support the purposes of 
        designated National Wildlife Corridors by maintaining habitat 
        connectivity across jurisdictional boundaries or providing 
        other essential functions for wildlife and its habitat.

SEC. 5. PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and
