        under this part does not select a repayment plan described in

        provide, on a case by case basis, an alternative repayment plan 
        to a borrower of a loan made under this part on or after July 
        1, 2016, who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary 
        that the terms and conditions of the repayment plans available 
        under paragraph (2) are not adequate to accommodate the 
        borrower's exceptional circumstances. Upon request, the 
        Secretary shall make available for such borrowers repayment 
        plans described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (1). 
        In designing such alternative repayment plans, the Secretary

        value of future payments by such borrowers, of loans made using 
        the plans available under paragraph (2).
