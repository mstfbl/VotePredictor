                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Aid Transparency and 
Accountability Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. GUIDELINES FOR UNITED STATES FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC 
              ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to evaluate the 
performance of United States foreign development and economic 
assistance and its contribution to the policies, strategies, projects, 
program goals, and priorities undertaken by the Federal Government, to 
foster and promote innovative programs to improve effectiveness, and to 
coordinate the monitoring and evaluation processes of Federal 
departments and agencies that administer United States foreign 
development and economic assistance.
    (b) Establishment of Guidelines.--Not later than 18 months after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall set forth 
guidelines for the establishment of measurable goals, performance 
metrics, and monitoring and evaluation plans that can be applied with 
reasonable consistency to United States foreign development and 
economic assistance. Such guidelines shall be established according to 
best practices of monitoring and evaluation studies and analyses.
    (c) Objectives of Guidelines.--
            (1) In general.--The guidelines established under 
        subsection (b) shall provide direction to Federal departments 
        and agencies that administer United States foreign development 
        and economic assistance on monitoring the use of resources, 
        evaluating the outcomes and impacts of United States foreign 
        development and economic assistance projects and programs, and 
        applying the findings and conclusions of such evaluations to 
        proposed project and program design.
            (2) Objectives.--Specifically, the guidelines established 
        under subsection (b) shall require Federal departments and 
        agencies that administer United States foreign development and 
        economic assistance to take the following actions:
                    (A) Establish annual monitoring and evaluation 
                agendas and objectives to plan and manage the process 
                of monitoring, evaluating, analyzing progress, and 
                applying learning toward achieving results.
                    (B) Develop specific project monitoring and 
                evaluation plans, to include measurable goals and 
                performance metrics, and identify the resources 
                necessary to conduct such evaluations, which should be 
                covered by program costs, during project design.
                    (C) Apply rigorous monitoring and evaluation 
                methodologies to such programs, including through the 
                use of impact evaluations, ex-post evaluations, or 
                other methods as appropriate, that clearly define 
                program logic, inputs, outputs, intermediate outcomes, 
                and end outcomes.
                    (D) Disseminate guidelines for the development and 
                implementation of monitoring and evaluation programs to 
                all personnel, especially in the field, who are 
                responsible for the design, implementation, and 
                management of United States foreign development and 
                economic assistance programs.
                    (E) Establish methodologies for the collection of 
                data, including baseline data to serve as a reference 
                point against which progress can be measured.
                    (F) Evaluate at least once in their lifetime all 
                programs whose dollar value equals or exceeds the 
                median program size for the relevant office or bureau 
                or an equivalent calculation to ensure the majority of 
                program resources are evaluated.
                    (G) Conduct impact evaluations on all pilot 
                programs before replicating wherever possible, or 
                provide a written justification for not conducting an 
                impact evaluation where such an evaluation was deemed 
                inappropriate or impossible.
                    (H) Develop a clearinghouse capacity for the 
                collection and dissemination of knowledge and lessons 
                learned that serve as benchmarks to guide future 
                programs for United States development professionals, 
                implementing partners, the donor community, and aid 
                recipient governments, and as a repository of knowledge 
                on lessons learned.
                    (I) Distribute evaluation reports internally.
                    (J) Develop a summary of each evaluation, including 
                a description of the evaluation methodology and key 
                findings and recommendations made in the evaluation 
                within 90 days after the completion of the evaluation.
                    (K) Undertake collaborative partnerships and 
                coordinate efforts with the academic community, 
                implementing partners, and national and international 
                institutions that have expertise in program monitoring, 
                evaluation, and analysis when such partnerships provide 
                needed expertise or significantly improve the 
                evaluation and analysis.
                    (L) Ensure verifiable, valid, credible, precise, 
                reliable, and timely data are available to monitoring 
                and evaluation personnel to permit the objective 
                evaluation of the effectiveness of United States 
                foreign development and economic assistance programs, 
                including an assessment of assumptions and limitations 
                in such evaluations.
                    (M) Ensure that standards of professional 
                evaluation organizations for monitoring and evaluation 
                efforts are employed, including ensuring the integrity 
                and independence of evaluations, permitting and 
                encouraging the exercise of professional judgment, and 
                providing for quality control and assurance in the 
                monitoring and evaluation process.
    (d) Presidential Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date
