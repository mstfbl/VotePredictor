        transparency with respect to items and services for which 
        payment may be made either to a hospital outpatient department 
        or to an ambulatory surgery center under this title, the 
        Secretary shall, for 2017 and each year thereafter, make 
        available to the public via a searchable website, with respect 
        to an appropriate number of such items and services--
                    ``(A) the estimated payment amount for such items 
                and services under the outpatient department fee 
                schedule under subsection (t) of section 1833 and the 
                ambulatory surgical center payment system under 
                subsection (i) of such section; and
                    ``(B) the estimated amount of beneficiary liability 
                applicable to such an item or service.
            ``(2) Calculation of estimated beneficiary liability.--For 
        purposes of subsection (a), the estimated beneficiary 
        liability, with respect to an item or service, is the amount 
        for such item or service for which an individual who does not 
        have coverage under a medicare supplemental policy certified 
        under section 1882 or any other supplemental insurance coverage 
        is responsible.
            ``(3) Implementation.--In carrying out this section, the 
        Secretary--
                    ``(A) shall include in the notice described in 
                section 1804(a) a notification of the availability of 
                the anticipated costs made available under subsection 
                (a); and
                    ``(B) may utilize existing mechanisms, such as the 
                portion of the website of the Centers for Medicare & 
                Medicaid Services on which information comparing 
                physician performance is posted (commonly referred to 
                as the Physician Compare website), to make available 
                such anticipated costs under such subsection.
            ``(4) Funding.--For purposes of implementing this 
        subsection, the Secretary shall provide for the transfer, from 
        the Supplemental Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 
        1841 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program 
        Management Account, of $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2015, to 
        remain available until expended.''.
