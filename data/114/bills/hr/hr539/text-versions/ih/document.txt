                                 A BILL


 
   To amend part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act to 
  improve essential oral health care for lower income individuals by 
        breaking down barriers to care, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Action for Dental Health Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 181 million Americans will not visit a 
        dentist even though nearly half of people over 30 suffer from 
        some form of gum disease and nearly one in four children under 
        the age of five already have cavities.
            (2) Many volunteer dental projects sponsored by national, 
        State, and local dental societies provide free care now to 
        those most in need. Annually, dentists deliver an estimated 
        $2.6 billion in free and discounted care according to the 
        America's Dentists Care Foundation.
            (3) It is estimated that emergency department (ED) charges 
        for dental complaints totaled up to $2.1 billion in 2010. 
        Nearly 80 percent of the dental emergency room visits were 
        nonurgent and could have been seen in a dental office. Shifting 
        those ED visits to a dental office translates into potential 
        cost savings of up to $1.7 billion a year and offers the 
        possibility of establishing a ``dental home'' for these 
        individuals.
            (4) Seniors, especially those in nursing homes and long-
        term care facilities, often have special dental needs and 
        complicated medical histories that require consultation between 
        dentists and fellow medical professionals in providing an 
        interdisciplinary approach to their overall health needs.

    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is revised by
