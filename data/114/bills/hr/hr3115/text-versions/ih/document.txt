        inconsistent with such directive--
                    (A) Army Regulation 190-14, issued on March 12,

        order that prohibits trained military personnel from carrying 
        officially issued firearms on military bases or Armed Forces 
        recruitment facilities shall have no force or effect with 
        regard to trained military personnel while on military bases 
        and Armed Forces recruitment facilities, and trained military 
        personnel shall not be prohibited from carrying officially 
        issued firearms on military bases or Armed Forces recruitment
