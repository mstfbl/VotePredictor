            (1) to provide a defense against charges of intentional 
        misrepresentation in any proceeding under State law regulating 
        the professional practices of health care providers and 
        practitioners;
            (2) to provide a defense in any criminal action, including 
        cases of rape or incest; or
            (3) to limit the recovery of damages in cases where the 
        conduct of the defendant caused personal injury or death to the 
        child or gestational mother.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, 
        the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or 
        possession of the United States; and
