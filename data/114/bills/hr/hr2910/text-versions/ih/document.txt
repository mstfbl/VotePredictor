                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Mexican wolf 
nonessential experimental population 10(j) rule has no force or effect, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Mexican Wolf Transparency and 
Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. NO FORCE OR EFFECT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Mexican wolf population has increased by 10 percent 
        in recent years, including increases in population in each of 
        the last 5 years.
            (2) At the end of 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife 
        Service documented a presence of a minimum of 109 Mexican 
        wolves on the landscape. The Service further stated on a 
        conference call on January 17, 2015 that there are an 
        additional 250 Mexican wolves in captivity.
            (3) The Mexican wolf population not in captivity increased 
        31 percent in 2014.
            (4) Nearly 90 percent of the Mexican wolf's original 
        habitat was within the borders of Mexico.
            (5) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), has 
        been using the same recovery plan for the Mexican wolf since 
        the early 1980s.
            (6) That plan is not based on the best available science 
        and is significantly out of date.
            (7) Officials have been calling for years for an updated 
        recovery plan that includes metrics that, if met, will allow 
        for delisting of the Mexican wolf.
            (8) The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has failed 
        to issue and comply with an updated recovery plan despite 
        acknowledging that the current plan is not in compliance with 
        that Act.
            (9) New rules issued for the Mexican wolf dramatically 
        expand to parts of New Mexico and Arizona, the border of 
        Mexico, and the border of Texas the area for an experimental 
        program.
            (10) The 10(j) nonessential experimental population program 
        for the Mexican wolf failed to secure funding before being 
        implemented.
            (11) Any future recovery plan for the Mexican wolf must 
        incorporate the recovery work underway in Mexico.
    (b) No Force or Effect.--The determination by the United States 
Fish and Wildlife Service of the endangered status for the Mexican wolf 
(Canis lupus baileyi) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), published January 16, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 2488), 
and the listing of such species as an endangered species under that Act 
pursuant to such determination, shall have no force or effect.
    (c) Termination of Rule.--The final rule entitled ``Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Revision to the Regulations for the 
Nonessential Experimental Population of the Mexican Wolf'', published 
January 16, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 2512) shall also have no force or 
effect.
