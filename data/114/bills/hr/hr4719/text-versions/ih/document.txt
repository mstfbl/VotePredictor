SEC. 3. REPORT ON HIGH-FREQUENCY LITIGATORS.

    Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General shall submit a report to Congress that analyzes the 
impact of the notice and compliance opportunity afforded under section 
308(a)(1)(B), as added by this Act. The report shall include--
            (1) a determination of the number of persons in each State 
        who have filed 10 or more actions alleging a violation 
        described in section 302(b)(2) of the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 within any 12-month period after the 
        date of enactment of this Act;
            (2) an analysis on whether the notice and compliance 
        opportunity has had an effect on the number of actions 
        commenced alleging such a violation;
            (3) an analysis on whether the notice and compliance 
        opportunity has impacted an individual's ability to bring a 
        legitimate good-faith accessibility claim under such section; 
        and
            (4) recommendations on whether a cap on recoverable 
        attorneys fees would reduce the number of such actions brought 
        by individual plaintiffs.
