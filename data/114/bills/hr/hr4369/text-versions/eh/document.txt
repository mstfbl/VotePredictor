                                 AN ACT


 
   To authorize the use of passenger facility charges at an airport 
    previously associated with the airport at which the charges are 
                               collected.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. USE OF PASSENGER FACILITY CHARGES FROM ONE AIRPORT AT A 
              PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED AIRPORT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On December 22, 2015, the Los Angeles City Council, the 
        Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners, the Los Angeles 
        World Airports, the Ontario City Council, and the Ontario 
        International Airport Authority agreed to transfer ownership 
        and control of Ontario International Airport from the city of 
        Los Angeles and Los Angeles World Airports to the Ontario 
        International Airport Authority, a local joint powers authority 
        established by and between the county of San Bernardino and the 
        city of Ontario.
            (2) Pursuant to the agreement, the Ontario International 
        Airport Authority intends to use between $70,000,000 and 
        $120,000,000 in passenger facility charges collected at Ontario 
        International Airport to finance eligible projects at Los 
        Angeles International Airport, as compensation for passenger 
        facility charges collected, consistent with section 40117(b)(1) 
        of title 49, United States Code, at Los Angeles International 
        Airport for use at Ontario International Airport in the 1990s, 
        when both airports were controlled by Los Angeles World 
        Airports.
            (3) The amendment made by subsection (b) applies 
        exclusively to Ontario International Airport, allowing 
        passenger facility charges to be used for eligible projects at 
        Los Angeles International Airport while making no other changes 
        to passenger facility charges eligibility requirements.
            (4) No additional appropriations are required to implement 
        the agreement described in paragraph (1) or the amendment made 
        by subsection (b).
    (b) Passenger Facility Charges.--Section 40117(b) of title 49, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) Use of pfc revenues at previously associated 
        airport.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding the requirements 
                of paragraph (1) and subject to subparagraph (B), the 
                Secretary may authorize use of a passenger facility 
                charge to finance an eligible airport-related project 
                if--
                            ``(i) the eligible agency seeking to impose 
                        the new charge controls an airport where a $2 
                        passenger facility charge became effective on 
                        January 1, 2013; and
                            ``(ii) the airport described in clause (i) 
                        and the airport at which the project will be 
                        carried out were under the control of the same 
                        eligible agency on October 1, 2015.
                    ``(B) Limitation.--Not more than $120,000,000 in 
                passenger facility charges collected under subparagraph 
                (A) may be used to carry out an eligible airport-
                related project described in that subparagraph.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives June 21, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
