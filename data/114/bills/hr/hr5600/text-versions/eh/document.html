                                 AN ACT


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
program to provide access to magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy 
                              to veterans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Hero Left Untreated Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Magnetic EEG/EKG-guided resonance therapy has 
        successfully treated more than 400 veterans with post-traumatic 
        stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual 
        trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction.
            (2) Recent clinical trials and randomized, placebo-
        controlled, double-blind studies have produced promising 
        measurable outcomes in the evolution of magnetic EEG/EKG-guided 
        resonance therapy.
            (3) These outcomes have resulted in escalating demand from 
        returning warriors and veterans who are seeking access to this 
        treatment.
            (4) Congress recognizes the importance of initiating 
        innovative pilot programs that demonstrate the use and 
        effectiveness of new treatment options for post-traumatic 
        stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual 
        trauma, chronic pain, and opiate addiction.

SEC. 3. MAGNETIC EEG/EKG-GUIDED RESONANCE THERAPY PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall carry 
out a pilot program to provide access to magnetic EEG/EKG-guided 
resonance therapy to treat larger populations of veterans suffering 
from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military 
sexual trauma, chronic pain, or opiate addiction.
    (b) Locations.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program 
under subsection (a) at not more than two facilities of the Department 
of Veteran Affairs.
    (c) Participants.--In carrying out the pilot program under 
subsection (a), the Secretary may not provide access to magnetic EEG/
EKG-guided resonance therapy to more than 50 veterans.
    (d) Duration.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program 
under subsection (a) for a 1-year period.
    (e) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
termination of the pilot program under subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate a report on the pilot program.
    (f) No Authorization of Appropriations.--No additional funds are 
authorized to be appropriated to carry out the requirements of this 
section. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise 
authorized.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 29, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
