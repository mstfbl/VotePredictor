        following decisions are the responsibility of the contracting 
        officer and may not be delegated to any person except for 
        another contracting officer who meets the training requirements

            ``(3) Number of offers; revisions to bids.--A Federal 
        agency may not award a contract using a reverse auction method

        submitted in relation to offers submitted by other offerors.
