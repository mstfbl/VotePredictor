SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE AUCTIONS.

U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 47 (15 U.S.C. 631 note) as 
        section 48; and
            (2) by inserting after section 46 the following new

may be used pursuant to the following requirements:
            ``(1) Decisions regarding use of a reverse auction.--A 
        contracting officer shall make the following decisions, which 
        may not be delegated to any person except for another 
        contracting officer who meets the training requirements of 
        paragraph (2):
                    ``(A) A decision to use reverse auction methods as 
                part of the competition for award of a contract.
                    ``(B) Any decision made after the decision 
                described in subsection (A) regarding the appropriate 
                evaluation criteria, the inclusion of vendors, the

                decisions regarding timeliness), and the selection of 
                the winner.
            ``(2) Training required.--Only a contracting officer who 
        has received training on the appropriate use and supervision of 
        reverse auction methods of contracting may supervise or use 
        such methods in a procurement for a contract. The training 
        shall be provided by, or similar to the training provided by, 
        the Defense Acquisition University as described in section 824 
        of the Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense

            ``(3) Number of offers; revisions to bids.--A Federal 
        agency may not award a contract using a reverse auction method 
        if only one offer is received or if offerors do not have the 
        ability to submit revised bids with lower prices throughout the 
        course of the auction.
            ``(4) Technically acceptable offers.--A Federal agency 
        awarding a contract using a reverse auction method shall 
        evaluate the technical acceptability of offers only as 
        technically acceptable or unacceptable.
            ``(5) Use of price rankings.--A Federal agency may not 
        award a contract using a reverse auction method if at any time 
        during the award process the Federal agency misinforms an 
        offeror about the price ranking of the offeror's last offer 
        submitted in relation to offers submitted by other offerors.
            ``(6) Use of third-party agents.--If a Federal agency uses 
        a third party agent to assist with the award of contracts using 
        a reverse auction method, the Federal agency shall ensure 
        that--
                    ``(A) inherently governmental functions (as such 
                term is used in section 2303 of title 41, United States 
                Code) are not performed by private contractors,

                party agent and shared with the Federal agency is 
                shared with the offeror and complies with section

                section 113 of title 41, United States Code) or to
