 To provide for the identification and prevention of improper payments 
and the identification of strategic sourcing opportunities by reviewing 
         and analyzing the use of Federal agency charge cards.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Federal Dollars Through 
Better Use of Government Purchase and Travel Cards Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Improper payment.--The term ``improper payment'' has 
        the meaning given the term in section 2 of the Improper 
        Payments Information Act of 2002 (31 U.S.C. 3321 note).
            (2) Questionable transaction.--The term ``questionable 
        transaction'' means a charge card transaction that from initial 
        card data appears to be high risk and may therefore be improper 
        due to non-compliance with applicable law, regulation or 
        policy.
            (3) Strategic sourcing.--The term ``strategic sourcing'' 
        means analyzing and modifying a Federal agency's spending 
        patterns to better leverage its purchasing power, reduce costs, 
        and improve overall performance.

SEC. 3. EXPANDED USE OF DATA ANALYTICS.

    (a) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in consultation with the Administrator for General Services, 
shall develop a strategy to expand the use of data analytics in 
managing government purchase and travel charge card programs. These 
analytics may employ existing General Services Administration 
capabilities, and may be in conjunction with agencies' capabilities, 
for the purpose of--
            (1) identifying examples or patterns of questionable 
        transactions and developing enhanced tools and methods for 
        agency use in--
                    (A) identifying questionable purchase and travel 
                card transactions; and
                    (B) recovering improper payments made with purchase 
                and travel cards;
            (2) identifying potential opportunities for agencies to 
        further leverage administrative process streamlining and cost 
        reduction from purchase and travel card use, including 
        additional agency opportunities for card-based strategic 
        sourcing;
            (3) developing a set of purchase and travel card metrics 
        and benchmarks for high-risk activities, which shall assist 
        agencies in identifying potential emphasis areas for their 
        purchase and travel card management and oversight activities, 
        including those required by the Government Charge Card Abuse 
        Prevention Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-194); and
            (4) developing a plan, which may be based on existing 
        capabilities, to create a library of analytics tools and data 
        sources for use by Federal agencies (including inspectors 
        general of those agencies).

SEC. 4. GUIDANCE ON IMPROVING INFORMATION SHARING TO CURB IMPROPER 
              PAYMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and 
the interagency charge card data management group established under 
section 5, shall issue guidance on improving information sharing by 
government agencies (including inspectors general) for the purposes of 
section 3(a)(1).
    (b) Elements.--The guidance issued under subsection (a) shall--
            (1) require relevant officials at Federal agencies to 
        identify high-risk activities and communicate that information 
        to the appropriate management levels within the agencies;
            (2) require that appropriate officials at Federal agencies 
        review the reports issued by charge card-issuing banks on 
        questionable transaction activity (such as purchase and travel 
        card pre-suspension and suspension reports, delinquency 
        reports, and exception reports), including transactions that 
        occur with high-risk activities, and suspicious timing or 
        amounts of cash withdrawals or advances;
            (3) provide for the appropriate sharing of information 
        related to potential questionable transactions, fraud schemes, 
        and high-risk activities with General Services Administration 
        Office of Charge Card Management and the appropriate officials 
        in Federal agencies; and
            (4) include other requirements determined appropriate by 
        the Director for the purposes of carrying out this Act.

        modifications related to charge card-issuing banks;
            (2) include the review of accounts payable information and 
        purchase and travel card transaction data of agencies for the 
        purpose of identifying potential strategic sourcing and other 
        additional opportunities (such as recurring payments, utility 
        payments, and grant payments) for which the charge cards or 
        related payment products could be used as a payment method; and
            (3) include other best practices as determined by the
