    It is the sense of Congress that the International Civil Aviation

practices related to the administration and governance of border 
controls and inspection formalities, should establish standards for the 
introduction of electronic passports (referred to in this section as 
``e-passports''), and obligate member countries to utilize such e-
passports as soon as possible. Such e-passports should be a combined 
paper and electronic passport that contains biographic and biometric 
information that can be used to authenticate the identity of travelers 
through an embedded chip.
