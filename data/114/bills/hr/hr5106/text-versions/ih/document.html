            (1) in subparagraph (A)(iii), by striking ``clauses (ii) 
        and (iii) of subparagraph (B)'' and inserting ``subparagraph 
        (B)(ii)''; and

                    (C) by redesignating clause (iv) as clause (iii).

SEC. 302. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST CUTTING FEDERAL PELL GRANTS.

    (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment 
between the Houses, or conference report that would decrease the 
appropriations provided for Federal Pell Grants under section 401(b)(7) 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a(b)(7)) or restrict 
eligibility for Federal Pell Grants.
    (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended 
in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the 
Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to 
sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised 
under subsection (a).

SEC. 303. AFFIRMING THAT FEDERAL PELL GRANTS ARE A FOUNDATIONAL 
              INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Research shows that with higher educational attainment, 
        individuals are more likely to be employed, earn higher wages, 
        secure health and retirement benefits, make healthier life 
        choices, and be more engaged citizens of their communities.
            (2) Higher education, whether at a 2- or 4-year 
        institution, can help people of the United States from lower 
        income backgrounds climb into the middle class.
            (3) In 2015, more than 20,000,000 students enrolled in 
        colleges and universities in the United States--an increase of 
        4,900,000 since 2000.
            (4) Despite the benefits of further education beyond high 
        school, many students from low-income backgrounds do not attend 
        college. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
        approximately 80 percent of high school graduates from the 
        wealthiest families pursue higher education, while only a 
        little more than half from the lowest income quartile attend 
        college.
            (5) Federal Pell Grants provide need-based aid to students 
        who want to further their education and are the single largest 
        source of grant aid for helping students afford college.
            (6) In award year 2013-2014, an estimated 73 percent of all 
        Pell Grant recipients had a total family income equal to or 
        less than $30,000.
            (7) In 2015, more than 8,200,000 students, or approximately 
        41 percent of all undergraduates, used Federal Pell Grants to 
        finance their education.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
Congress should--
            (1) affirm that Federal Pell Grants are a foundational 
        investment in affordable higher education for students and 
        families; and
            (2) commit to ensuring that Federal Pell Grants remain a 
        stable source of financial support for students and families.

                        TITLE IV--ACCOUNTABILITY

SEC. 401. SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER 
              EDUCATION ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ENSURING THE HIGH VALUE OF 
              DEGREES AND CREDENTIALS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The employment rate for people of the United States 
        between the ages of 21 to 25 has declined by 12 percent from 
        2000 through 2012.
            (2) The cost of attending a 4-year public institution of 
        higher education has increased by 32 percent from 2002 through 
        2012.
            (3) More than 1 in 4 student loan borrowers are now in 
        default or delinquent on a student loan.
            (4) There are limited means through which to ensure that 
        institutions of higher education are held accountable for the 
        value of the degrees and credentials obtained by students, or 
        the outcomes of those students.
            (5) Student borrowers who obtain a high-value degree or 
        credential are much more likely to be able to find a good 
        paying job and repay their student loan debt.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
Congress should support efforts to ensure that institutions of higher 
education have strong incentives to ensure that students graduate with 
degrees and credentials that have a high value, and that will enable 
graduates to secure good-paying employment in their field of study and 
enjoy long-term success, by--
            (1) enhancing accountability for institutions of higher 
        education for the quality and cost of degree programs, 
        including student debt burden;
            (2) holding institutions of higher education and their 
        leaders financially accountable when the institutions or 
        leaders engage in fraud or misconduct that violates Federal and 
        State laws;
            (3) creating incentives and tools that will allow State 
        governments and institutions of higher education to curb 
        tuition inflation and maintain investment in higher education;
            (4) creating incentives for institutions of higher 
        education to direct more resources to their academic programs 
        and to provide pathways to ensure that all students can 
        complete their degrees and credentials in a timely manner; and
            (5) guaranteeing that the servicing of student loans made, 
        insured, or guaranteed under part B or D of title IV of the 
        Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq., 1087a et 
        seq.) provided through these institutions of higher education 
        will meet the highest standards of quality, customer service, 
        and compliance with the law to promote borrower success and 
        minimize defaults.

                            TITLE V--OFFSETS

SEC. 501. AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.

    Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this title an 
amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal 
of, a section or other provision, the reference shall be considered to 
be made to a section or other provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986.
