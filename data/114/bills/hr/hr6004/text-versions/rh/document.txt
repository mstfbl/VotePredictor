_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To modernize Government information technology, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing Government Technology 
Act of 2016'' or the ``MGT Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government spends nearly 75 percent of its 
        annual information technology funding on operating and 
        maintaining existing, legacy information technology systems. 
        These systems can pose operational risks, including rising 
        costs and inability to meet mission requirements. These systems 
        also pose security risks, including the inability to use 
        current security best practices, such as data encryption and 
        multi-factor authentication, making these systems particularly 
        vulnerable to malicious cyber activity.
            (2) In 2015, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
        designated Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and 
        Operations to its biannual High Risk List and identified as a 
        particular concern the increasing level of information 
        technology spending on Operations and Maintenance making less 
        funding available for development or modernization. The GAO 
        also found the Government has spent billions on failed and 
        poorly performing IT investments due to a lack of effective 
        oversight.
            (3) The Federal Government must modernize Federal IT 
        systems to mitigate existing operational and security risks.
            (4) The efficiencies, cost savings, and greater computing 
        power, offered by modernized solutions, such as cloud 
        computing, have the potential to--
                    (A) eliminate inappropriate duplication and reduce 
                costs;
                    (B) address the critical need for cyber security by 
                design; and
                    (C) move the Federal Government into a broad, 
                digital-services delivery model that will transform the 
                Federal Government's ability to meet mission 
                requirements and deliver services to the American 
                people.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:
            (1) Assist the Federal Government in modernized Federal 
        information technology to mitigate current operational and 
        security risks.
            (2) Incentivize cost savings in Federal information 
        technology through modernization.
            (3) Accelerate the acquisition and deployment of modernized 
        information technology solutions, such as cloud computing, by 
        addressing impediments in the areas of funding, development, 
        and acquisition practices.

        described in paragraph (3).
            (2) Source of funds.--Amounts may be deposited into an IT

                information technology systems, in compliance with any 
                applicable reprogramming law or guidelines of the 
                Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
                Representatives and the Senate.
                    (B) Transfer of funds, including transfer of any 
                funds available on the date of the enactment of this 
                Act for the operation and maintenance of legacy 
                information technology systems, but only if transfer

        maintenance of any system already within an appropriation for 
        the covered agency at the time of establishment of the IT 
        working capital fund.
            (5) Reprogramming and transfer of funds.--The head of each

        Government. The head of each covered agency may--
                    (A) reprogram any amounts saved as a direct result 
                of such activities for deposit into the applicable IT 
                working capital fund, consistent with paragraph (2)(A); 
                and

                General Services at the time of transfer, such funds 
                shall be transferred only on an incremental basis, tied 
                to metric-based development milestones achieved by the 
                agency, to be described in the written agreement

                and operational risks, having the greatest 
                Governmentwide impact, and having a high probability of 
                success based on factors such as a strong business 
                case, technical design, procurement strategy (including 
                adequate use of incremental software development 
                practices), and program management.
                    (B) Make recommendations to the Administrator of
