                by the Bureau.
                    ``(B) Exception.--The Bureau may revoke an 
                exemption provided under subparagraph (A) with respect 
                to a specific rule or regulation and a specific class

                        regulations issued or modified after the date 
                        of enactment of this paragraph.

                        the date of enactment of this paragraph with 
                        respect to community financial institutions if 
                        the effect of such modification is to expand a 
                        current exemption or to reduce the costs and
