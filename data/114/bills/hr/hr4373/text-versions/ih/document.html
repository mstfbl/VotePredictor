 To improve the safety of individuals by taking measures to end drunk 
                                driving.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``End Drunk Driving Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities represent 
        approximately one-third of all highway fatalities in the United 
        States in a given year.
            (2) First offenders were responsible for 75 percent of 
        drunk driving arrests and 25 percent were from repeat 
        offenders.
            (3) In 2013, there were 10,076 alcohol-impaired driving 
        fatalities in the United States.
            (4) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has 
        partnered with automobile manufacturers to develop alcohol 
        detection technologies that may be installed in vehicles to 
        prevent drunk driving.
            (5) An estimated 59,000 lives and $343,000,000,000 may be 
        saved over a 15-year period by the widespread installation of 
        alcohol detection technologies in motor vehicles.

SEC. 3. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO END DRUNK DRIVING.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 10 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue a final rule 
prescribing or amending a Federal motor vehicle safety standard that 
would prevent operation of a motor vehicle when the operator is under 
the influence of alcohol. The standard--
            (1) shall prevent the operation of the motor vehicle if the 
        operator's blood alcohol content is above the legal limit; and
            (2) shall require such technology to be--
                    (A) reliable and accurate;
                    (B) set at the legal limit;
                    (C) unobtrusive and fast;
                    (D) tamper-proof/circumvention-resistant;
                    (E) functionary in extreme environments (both hot 
                and cold); and
                    (F) easily maintained.

              SAFETY RESEARCH.
