    (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may

income, very low-income, and extremely low-income owners of dated 
manufactured homes for the replacement of such dated manufactured homes 
with Energy Star-qualified manufactured or modular homes.
    (b) Grants.--
            (1) Eligible entities.--The Secretary may provide grants 
        under this section only to--

            (2) Competition; priority.--The Secretary shall provide

        priority to applicants for such grants that, in accordance with 
        criteria established by the Secretary--
                    (A) demonstrate that providing a grant to the 
                applicant would result in substantial energy gains and 
                returns on investment on replacement of dated 
                manufactured homes;
                    (B) will use grants in areas having the 
                infrastructure or planned infrastructure necessary to 
                replace dated manufactured homes;
                    (C) will act in partnership with providers of high

                owners of dated manufactured homes pursuant to a grant 
                under this section with funds from other sources, and 
                provide such assurances as the Secretary considers 
                necessary to ensure that such supplemental amounts are 
                available for such purpose.
            (3) Use of funds.--A grantee shall use amounts from a grant

        amounts--
                    (A) the unused amount of the grant shall revert to 
                the Secretary; and

                for loans made with assistance provided under this 
                subsection, and servicers of such loans, as necessary 
                to ensure that such loans are high quality affordable 
                lending products that enable sustainable homeownership.
                    (B) A grant for the decommissioning, and any
