Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any Executive order, the 
Administrator may not use the social cost of carbon to incorporate 
social benefits of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, or for any other

that is estimated to cost more than $100,000,000 unless a Federal law 
is enacted authorizing the use.
