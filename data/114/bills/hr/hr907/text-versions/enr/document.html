SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) As of January 22, 2015, the United States Government has 
    provided $3,046,343,000 in assistance to respond to the Syria 
    humanitarian crisis, of which nearly $467,000,000 has been provided 
    to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
        (2) As of January 2015, according to the United Nations High 
    Commissioner for Refugees, there were 621,937 registered Syrian 
    refugees in Jordan and 83.8 percent of whom lived outside refugee 
    camps.
        (3) In 2000, the United States and Jordan signed a free-trade 
    agreement that went into force in 2001.
        (4) In 1996, the United States granted Jordan major non-NATO 
    ally status.
        (5) Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and the 
    threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
        (6) The Government of Jordan was elected as a non-permanent 
    member of the United Nations Security Council for a 2-year term 
    ending in December 2015.
        (7) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with Jordan is 
    important to the national security of the United States, including 
    through creation of a status in law for Jordan similar to the 
    countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan, 
    Australia, the Republic of Korea, Israel, and New Zealand, with 
    respect to consideration by Congress of foreign military sales to 
    Jordan.
        (8) The Colorado National Guard's relationship with the 
    Jordanian military provides a significant benefit to both the 
    United States and Jordan.
        (9) Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was brutally murdered by 
    ISIL.
        (10) On February 3, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry and 
    Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh signed a new Memorandum of 
    Understanding that reflects the intention to increase United States 
    assistance to the Government of Jordan from $660,000,000 to 
    $1,000,000,000 for each of the years 2015 through 2017.
        (11) On December 5, 2014, in an interview on CBS This Morning, 
    Jordanian King Abdullah II stated--
            (A) in reference to ISIL, ``This is a Muslim problem. We 
        need to take ownership of this. We need to stand up and say 
        what is wrong''; and
            (B) ``This is our war. This is a war inside Islam. So we 
        have to own up to it. We have to take the lead. We have to 
        start fighting back.''.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
    It should be the policy of the United States--
        (1) to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its response 
    to the Syrian refugee crisis;
        (2) to provide necessary assistance to alleviate the domestic 
    burden to provide basic needs for the assimilated Syrian refugees;
        (3) to cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat 
    from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other 
    terrorist organizations; and
        (4) to help secure the border between Jordan and its neighbors 
    Syria and Iraq.

    construction services, and major defense equipment to the Hashemite 
    Kingdom of Jordan under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
    Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent with United States 
    security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of world 
    peace and security;
        (2) Congress welcomes the statement of King Abdullah II quoted 
    in section (2)(11); and
        (3) it is in the interest of peace and stability for regional

    commitment to, and increase their involvement in, addressing the 
    threat posed by ISIL.
