    (c) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Safe Drinking Water Act has not been substantially 
        amended in 20 years, during which time the challenges facing 
        drinking water systems and customers have increased 
        dramatically.
            (2) Climate change, aging infrastructure, lead 
        contamination, and emerging contaminants threaten the public 
        health and economic viability of cities and towns nationwide.
            (3) The drinking water standard-setting provisions put in 
        place in 1996 have proven unworkable, preventing the Federal 
        Government from regulating dangerous contaminants, including 
        perchlorate, strontium, and volatile organic compounds.
            (4) Compliance and enforcement with existing drinking water 
        standards has fallen far short of what is needed and expected.
            (5) Increased drinking water investment is needed to 
        address a crisis in failing infrastructure.
