            (1) In general.--In a State in which marihuana may be

                minor;
                    (E) an entity from producing, processing, or 
                otherwise manufacturing marihuana for medical use, as

        cannabidiol from the definition of marihuana in section 102 of 
        the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802), as amended, and 
        section 5 of this Act, this subsection applies with respect to

is performed in a scientifically sound manner in a State where 
marihuana or cannabidiol is legal for medical purposes, and in
