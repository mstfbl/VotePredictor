                        heater or a control system integrated into the 
                        water heater) that is locked by default and 
                        contains a physical, software, or digital 
                        communication that must be activated with an 
                        activation key to enable the product to operate 
                        at its designed specifications and capabilities 
                        and without which activation the product will 
                        provide not greater than 50 percent of the 
                        rated first hour delivery of hot water
