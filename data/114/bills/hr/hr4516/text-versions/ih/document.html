                                 A BILL


 
To require data brokers to establish procedures to ensure the accuracy 
       of collected personal information, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Data Broker Accountability and 
Transparency Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The privacy of an individual is directly affected by 
        the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal 
        information by data brokers.
            (2) An individual rarely has any knowledge about the 
        processing of the individual's personal information by data 
        brokers.
            (3) The processing of personal information by data brokers 
        and the commercial clients of data brokers affects economic 
        marketplace opportunities available to individuals.
            (4) The use of data broker information by Federal, State, 
        and local agencies can affect the ability of an individual to 
        travel, work, obtain government benefits, and receive 
        government services.
            (5) An individual does not always have a right to access or 
        seek correction of personal information maintained by data 
        brokers.
            (6) Data brokers operate in interstate commerce, and it is 
        necessary and proper for Congress to regulate the processing of 
        information by data brokers.
            (7) Existing law does not provide an individual with 
        sufficient privacy or due process protections.
            (8) Requiring data brokers to provide an individual with 
        fair information practices will increase fairness, improve 
        privacy, promote economic growth, and limit identity theft and 
        other criminal activity by increasing the accuracy and quality 
        of information relied upon by governments and businesses.

SEC. 5. REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING ACCURACY OF AND ACCESS TO PERSONAL 
              INFORMATION.

                assembles, or maintains; and
                    (B) any other information it collects, assembles,

                individual's name or address.
            (2) Exception.--A covered data broker may collect or 
        maintain information that may be inaccurate with respect to a 
        particular individual if that information is being collected or 
        maintained solely for the purpose of--
                    (A) indicating whether there may be a discrepancy 
                or irregularity in the personal information that is 
                associated with an individual;
                    (B) helping to identify, or to authenticate the 
                identity of, an individual; or

            (3) Period of review.--A covered data broker shall provide 
        an individual the means required under paragraph (1) within

                        the information and, if reasonably available, 
                        where to direct the individual's request for 
                        correction; or
                            (ii) if the individual provides proof that 
                        the public record has been corrected or that 
                        the covered data broker was reporting the 
                        information incorrectly, correct the inaccuracy 
                        in the covered data broker's records; and

                        including the individual's written request;
                            (ii) if the information can be 
                        independently verified, use the procedures 
                        established under subsection (a) to 
                        independently verify the information; and
                            (iii) if the covered data broker was 
                        reporting the information incorrectly, correct 
                        the inaccuracy in the covered data broker's 
                        records.

        data broker is subject to a requirement under paragraph (2) due 
        to a request made by an individual under paragraph (1), such
