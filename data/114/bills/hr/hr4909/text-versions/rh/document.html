SEC. 122. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AIRCRAFT CARRIER PROCUREMENT SCHEDULES.

            (1) In a report submitted to Congress on March 17, 2015, 
        the Secretary of the Navy indicated the Department of the Navy 
        has a requirement of 11 aircraft carriers.
            (2) In the Congressional Budget Office report titled ``An 
        Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2016 Shipbuilding Plan'', 
        the Office stated as follows: ``To prevent the carrier force 
        from declining to 10 ships in the 2040s, 1 short of its 
        inventory goal of 11, the Navy could accelerate purchases after 
        2018 to 1 every four years, rather than 1 every five years''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the plan of the Department of the Navy to schedule the 
        procurement of one aircraft carrier every five years will 
        reduce the overall aircraft carrier inventory to 10 aircraft 
        carriers, a level insufficient to meet peacetime and war plan 
        requirements; and
            (2) to accommodate the required aircraft carrier force 
        structure, the Department of the Navy should--
                    (A) begin to program construction for the Ford 
                class aircraft carrier designated CVN-81 in fiscal year 
                2022; and
                    (B) program the required advance procurement 
                activities to accommodate the construction of such 
                carrier.

SEC. 416. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FULL-TIME SUPPORT FOR THE ARMY NATIONAL

        consisting of active and reserve personnel and military 
        technicians for the Army National Guard is essential to 
        maintaining the readiness of the Army National Guard;
            (2) the full-time support force for the Army National Guard 
        is the primary mechanism through which the programs of the Army 
        and the Department of Defense are delivered to all 350,000 
        soldiers of the Army National Guard;
            (3) reductions in active and reserve personnel and military 
        technicians since 2014, totaling 2401, have adversely impacted 
        the readiness of the Army National Guard;
            (4) the growth in the full-time support force for the Army 
        National Guard since 2014 is due solely to validated 
        requirements originating before September 11, 2001, and not 
        war-time growth;
            (5) funding for the full-time support force for the Army 
        National Guard has never exceeded 72 percent of the validated 
        requirement of the headquarters of the Department of the Army;
            (6) the current size of the full-time support force for the 
        Army National Guard is the minimum required to maintain 
        foundational readiness requirements; and
            (7) further reducing the size of the full-time support 
        force for the Army National Guard will have adverse and long-
        lasting impacts on readiness.

the requirements of this subsection. Notwithstanding the amount of the 
uniform surcharge assessed in subsection (d), the Secretary may provide 
for an alternative surcharge of not more than five percent of sales 
proceeds under such variable pricing program to be made available for 
the purposes specified in subsection (h).
    ``(2) Subject to subsection (k), before establishing a variable 
pricing program under this subsection, the Secretary shall establish 
the following:

        provision of high quality grocery merchandise, discount savings 
        to patrons, and levels of customer satisfaction while achieving 
        savings for the Department of Defense.
            ``(B) A baseline of overall savings to patrons achieved by 
        commissary stores prior to the initiation of the variable 
        pricing program, based on a comparison of prices charged by 
        those stores on a regional basis with prices charged by 
        relevant local competitors for a representative market basket 
        of goods.
    ``(3) The Secretary shall ensure that the defense commissary system 
implements the variable pricing program by conducting price comparisons 
using the methodology established for paragraph (2)(B) and adjusting 
pricing as necessary to ensure that pricing in the variable pricing 
program achieves overall savings to patrons that are consistent with 
the baseline savings established for the relevant region pursuant to 
such paragraph.

Instrumentality.--(1) Subject to subsection (k), if the Secretary 
determines that the variable pricing program has met the benchmarks for 
success established pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (i) and 
the savings requirements established pursuant to paragraph (3) of such 
subsection over a period of at least six months, the Secretary may 
convert the defense commissary system to a nonappropriated fund entity 
or instrumentality, with operating expenses financed in whole or in 
part by receipts from the sale of products and the sale of services. 
Upon such conversion, appropriated funds shall be transferred to the 
defense commissary system only in accordance with paragraph (2) or 
section 2491 of this title. The requirements of section 2483 shall not 
apply to the defense commissary system operating as a nonappropriated 
fund entity or instrumentality.

system operating as a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality is 
likely to incur a loss in any fiscal year as a result of compliance 
with the savings requirement established in subsection (i), the 
Secretary shall authorize a transfer of appropriated funds available 
for such purpose to the commissary system in an amount sufficient to 
offset the anticipated loss. Any funds so transferred shall be 
considered to be nonappropriated funds for such purpose.
    ``(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense may identify positions of 
employees in the defense commissary system who are paid with 
appropriated funds whose status may be converted to the status of an 
employee of a nonappropriated fund entity or instrumentality.
    ``(B) The status and conversion of employees in a position 
identified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall be addressed 
as provided in section 2491(c) for employees in morale, welfare, and 
recreation programs, including with respect to requiring the consent of 
such employee to be so converted.

system as of the date of the enactment of this subsection shall suffer 
any loss of or decrease in pay as a result of a conversion made under 
this paragraph.

(1) With respect to each action described in paragraph (2), the 
Secretary may not carry out such action until--

        committees a briefing on such action, including a justification 
        for such action; and

the exchange system to enter into contracts or other agreements--

SEC. 837. CLOSEOUT OF OLD DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY CONTRACTS.

    (a) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Secretary of the Navy may close out the contracts described in 
subsection (b) through the issuance of one or more modifications to 
such contracts without completing further reconciliation audits or 
corrective actions other than those described in this section. To 
accomplish closeout of such contracts--
            (1) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        in other contract line items within a contract regardless of 
        the year or type of appropriation obligated to fund each 
        contract line item and regardless of whether the appropriations 
        for such contract line items have closed; and
            (2) remaining contract balances may be offset with balances 
        on other contracts regardless of the year or type of 
        appropriation obligated to fund each contract and regardless of 
        whether the appropriations for such contract line item have 
        closed.
    (b) Contracts Covered.--The contracts covered by this section are a 
group of contracts that are with one contractor and identified by the 
Secretary, each one of which is a contract--
            (1) to design, construct, repair, or support the 
        construction or repair of Navy submarines that--
                    (A) was entered into between fiscal years 1974 and 
                1998; and
                    (B) has no further supply or services deliverables 
                due under the terms and conditions of the contract;
            (2) with respect to which the Secretary of the Navy has 
        established the total final contract value; and
            (3) with respect to which the Secretary of the Navy has 
        determined that the final allowable cost may have a negative or 
        positive unliquidated obligation balance for which it would be 
        difficult to determine the year or type of appropriation 
        because--
                    (A) the records for the contract have been 
                destroyed or lost; or
                    (B) the records for the contract are available but 
                the contracting officer, in collaboration with the 
                certifying official, has determined that a discrepancy 
                is of such a minimal value that the time and effort 
                required to determine the cause of an out-of-balance 
                condition is disproportionate to the amount of the 
                discrepancy.
    (c) Closeout.--The contracts described in subsection (b) may be 
closed out--
            (1) upon receipt of $581,803 from the contractor, to be 
        deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts; and
            (2) without seeking further amounts from the contractor, 
        and without payment to the contractor of any amounts that may 
        be due under such contracts.
    (d) Adjustment and Closure of Records.--After closeout of any 
contract described in subsection (b) using the authority of this 
section, the payment or accounting offices concerned may adjust and 
close any open finance and accounting records relating to the contract.

      TITLE IX--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT

                  Subtitle A--Goldwater-Nichols Reform

SEC. 901. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GOLDWATER-NICHOLS REFORM.

    It is the sense of Congress that the following principles should be 
adhered to in any reform of the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense 
Reorganization Act of 1986:
            (1) Civilian control of the military and the civilian chain 
        of command must be preserved.
            (2) The role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
        in providing independent military advice, as the principal 
        military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense, 
        must be preserved.
            (3) Any changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 should 
        be rooted in a clear identification and understanding of the 
        issues and the objectives and ramifications of any changes.
            (4) Any changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 should 
        enhance the capabilities of the United States Armed Forces.
            (5) Each Geographical Unified Command has its own distinct 
        area of emphasis and expertise, as well as requirements and 
        responsibilities. Combining Northern Command and Southern 
        Command, or combining European Command and Africa Command, 
        would severely degrade mission effectiveness, but would provide 
        only marginal increased efficiency. Additionally, consolidating 
        Geographic Unified Commands would cause unacceptable risk to 
        both global strategic influence as well as regional capability, 
        and would exacerbate already significant capacity challenges.
            (6) The emphasis on strategy and planning in the Goldwater-
        Nichols Act must be sustained.
            (7) Complex security challenges will become increasingly 
        transregional, multi-domain, and multi-functional.
            (8) Therefore, the Department of Defense, including 
        streamlined headquarters staffs, must be more agile and 
        adaptive.

SEC. 1089. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONNECTICUT'S SUBMARINE CENTURY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval 
        appropriations Act that authorized the Secretary of the Navy to 
        ``receive and accept a deed of gift, when offered by the State 
        of Connecticut, of a tract of land with not less than one mile 
        of shore front on the Thames River near New London, 
        Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval 
        purposes''.
            (2) The people of Connecticut and the towns and cities in 
        the southeastern region of Connecticut subsequently gifted land 
        to establish a military installation to fulfil the Nation's 
        need for a naval facility on the Atlantic coast.
            (3) On April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of gift 
        of land from Connecticut to establish a naval yard and storage 
        depot along the eastern shore of the Thames River in Groton, 
        Connecticut;
            (4) Between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard 
        supported a diverse range of missions, including berthing 
        inactive Civil War era ironclad warships and serving as a 
        coaling station for refueling naval ships traveling in New 
        England waters.
            (5) Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New 
        London Navy Yard in 1912, following an impassioned effort by 
        Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, who stated that ``this action 
        proposed is not only unjust but unreasonable and unsound as a 
        military proposition''.
            (6) The outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of 
        submarines to sink allied military and civilian ships in the 
        Atlantic sparked a new focus on developing submarine 
        capabilities in the United States.
            (7) October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New London 
        Navy Yard of the submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under the care of 
        the tender U.S.S. OZARK, soon followed by the arrival of 
        submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the care of the tender 
        U.S.S. TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of the 
        first ship built as a submarine tender, the U.S.S. FULTON (AS-
        1).
            (8) On June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling assumed the 
        command of the newly designated Naval Submarine Base New 
        London, the New London Submarine Flotilla, and the Submarine 
        School;
            (9) In the 100 years since the arrival of the first 
        submarines to the base, Naval Submarine Base New London has 
        grown to occupy more than 680 acres along the east side of the 
        Thames River, with more than 160 major facilities, 15 nuclear 
        submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and activities, 
        including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval Submarine 
        School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, the 
        Naval Undersea Medical Institute, and the newly established 
        Undersea Warfighting Development Center.
            (10) In addition to being the site of the first submarine 
        base in the United States, Connecticut was home to the foremost 
        submarine manufacturers of the time, the Lake Torpedo Boat 
        Company in Bridgeport and the Electric Boat Company in Groton, 
        which later became General Dynamics Electric Boat.
            (11) General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented 
        workforce, and its Connecticut-based and nationwide network of 
        suppliers have delivered more than 200 submarines from its 
        current location in Groton, Connecticut, including the first 
        nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and 
        nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built by the United 
        States.
            (12) The Submarine Force Library and Museum, located 
        adjacent to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, 
        Connecticut, is the only submarine museum operated by the 
        United States Navy and today serves as the primary repository 
        for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to the bold 
        and courageous history of the Submarine Force and highlights as 
        its core exhibit the Historic Ship NAUTILUS (SSN 571) following 
        her retirement from service.
            (13) Reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and the 
        Navy that began with the gift of land that established the 
        base, the State of Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 in 
        funding for critical infrastructure investments to support the 
        mission of the base, including construction of a new dive 
        locker building, expansion of the Submarine Learning Center, 
        and modernization of energy infrastructure.
            (14) On September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel 
        Malloy designated October 2015 through October 2016 as 
        Connecticut's Submarine Century, a year-long observance that 
        celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in Connecticut, 
        including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine 
        Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial 
        anniversary of the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New 
        London and the Naval Submarine School.
            (15) Whereas Naval Submarine Base New London still proudly 
        proclaims its motto of ``The First and Finest''.
            (16) Congressman Higgins' statement before Congress in 1912 
        that ``Connecticut stands ready, as she always has, to bear her 
        part of the burdens of the national defense'' remains true 
        today.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution 
        to the Navy and submarine force by the people of Connecticut, 
        both through the initial deed of gift that established what 
        would become Naval Submarine Base New London and through their 
        ongoing commitment to support the mission of the base and the 
        Navy personnel assigned to it;
            (2) honors the submariners who have trained and served at 
        Naval Submarine Base New London throughout its history in 
        support of the Nation's security and undersea superiority;
            (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and 
        workforce of Connecticut in designing, building, and sustaining 
        the Navy's submarine fleet; and
            (4) encourages the recognition of Connecticut's Submarine 
        Century by Congress, the Navy, and the American people by 
        honoring the contribution of the people of Connecticut to the 
        defense of the United States and the important role of the 
        submarine force in safeguarding the security of the United 
        States for more than a century.

        MV-22 mishap at Marana Northwest Regional Airport, Arizona, in 
        a way consistent with the results of all investigations as soon 
        as possible'';
            (2) the Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work did an 
        excellent job reviewing the investigations of such mishap and 
        concluded that there was a misrepresentation of facts by the

SEC. 1093. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF PANAMA CITY, 
              FLORIDA, TO THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF THE ARMED FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On December 6, 1941--one day before the attack on Pearl 
        Harbor--the War Department established Tyndall Field as an Army 
        Air Force gunnery school in Panama City, Florida.
            (2) Tyndall Field was named in honor of native Floridian 
        Lieutenant Francis B. Tyndall, who received the U.S. Air Force 
        flying ace designation for his service in the First World War.
            (3) Tyndall Field became an important center for aerial 
        gunnery training during the Second World War, hosting training 
        missions using aircraft including A-33, 0-47, AT-6, Martin B-26 
        Marauders, and B-17 bombers.
            (4) On January 13, 1948, Tyndall Field became Tyndall Air 
        Force Base and was an active site for air training and defense 
        throughout the Cold War.
            (5) Tyndall AFB is now home to the First Air Force as well 
        as the 325th Fighter Wing Headquarters and their F-22 Raptors.
            (6) The 325th Fighter Wing has been instrumental to 
        national security at such crucial junctures as the Cuban 
        Missile Crisis, throughout the Cold War, and more recently in 
        intercepting unidentified aircraft and supporting anti-
        smuggling efforts.
            (7) On July 20, 1945, the Navy Mine Countermeasure Station 
        was established in Panama City.
            (8) The Navy Mine Countermeasure Station developed into the 
        Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSAPC), which has 
        faithfully carried out its mission since its inception and 
        continues to support the crucial efforts and important research 
        of tenant command organizations such as the Naval Surface 
        Warfare Center: Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) and the Navy 
        Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU).
            (9) Research performed at NSWC PCD has been integral to 
        equipping the Navy with the personnel and technology necessary 
        to maintaining its status as the world's greatest and most 
        technologically advanced.
            (10) NSWC PCD's newest facility, the Littoral Warfare 
        Research Facility, is one of the Navy's major research, 
        development, test, and evaluation laboratories and where 
        standards for weapons integration on Littoral Combat Ships are 
        often developed.
            (11) NEDU is a global hub of research, development, and 
        testing for undersea operations.
            (12) During the Second World War, the Wainwright Shipyard 
        in Panama City built over 100 vessels for the war effort and 
        employed over 15,000 people.
            (13) Panama City's shipbuilding legacy continues as home to 
        one of today's most prolific domestic shipbuilders, Eastern 
        Shipbuilding.
            (14) The Department of Defense is the largest employer in 
        Panama City, where many of the residents and their relatives 
        have proudly served in the Armed Forces for generations.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution 
        to the Armed Forces by the people of Panama City, both through 
        the legacy of naval shipbuilding and through their ongoing 
        commitment to support the mission of Panama City's military 
        installations and the personnel assigned to them;
            (2) honors the members of the Armed Forces who have trained 
        and served at the several military installations in and around 
        Panama City;
            (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and 
        workforce of Panama City to naval shipbuilding; and
            (4) encourages the recognition of the importance of Panama 
        City to the history of the Armed Forces by Congress, the Air 
        Force, the Navy, and the American people by honoring the 
        contribution of the people of Panama City to the defense of the 
        United States.

SEC. 1215. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES POLICY AND STRATEGY IN 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States continues to have vital national 
        security interests in ensuring that Afghanistan is a stable, 
        sovereign country.
            (2) President Obama signed a Strategic Partnership 
        Agreement and a Bilateral Security Agreement with the President 
        of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which commits the 
        United States to the long-term security of, and defense 
        cooperation with, the Government of Afghanistan and designates 
        Afghanistan as a ``major non-NATO ally''.
            (3) The unity government in Afghanistan, led by President 
        Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah, should be applauded for 
        their continued leadership and commitment to Afghanistan's 
        stability and security.
            (4) Stability and security in Afghanistan reinforces 
        stability and security in the region.
            (5) The best long-term guarantor of stability and security 
        in Afghanistan is a stable unity government and a capable 
        Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).
            (6) The President's current policy is to draw down from 
        9,800 to 5,500 United States troops by January 1, 2017. As the 
        recent commander in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, 
        testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``the 5,500 
        [U.S. troops] plan was developed primarily around 
        counterterrorism. There's very limited train-advise-and-
        assist...in those numbers. To continue to build on the Afghan 
        Security Forces, the gaps and seams in aviation, logistics, 
        intelligence...we'd have to make some adjustments to that 
        number.''.
            (7) The President's policy of limiting the number of United 
        States troops that the commander can employ in Afghanistan is 
        hindering the effectiveness of the United States mission 
        therein.
            (8) Further, at the current policy of 9,800 United States 
        troops, the new commander of Operation Resolute Support in 
        Afghanistan, General John ``Mick'' Nicholson, agreed in 
        testimony with the Senate Armed Services Committee that the 
        security situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating rather 
        than improving.
            (9) General John Campbell also stated ``. . .Afghan 
        shortfalls will persist beyond 2016. Capability gaps still 
        exist in fixed and rotary-wing aviation, combined arms 
        operations, intelligence collection and dissemination, and 
        maintenance.''.
            (10) General John Campbell further stated ``I have the 
        authority to protect coalition members against any insurgents. 
        . .to attack the Taliban just because they're Taliban, I do not 
        have that authority.''.
            (11) The Taliban have made territorial gains and are 
        holding terrain in key geographic areas in Afghanistan, 
        including in Helmand Province.
            (12) The Taliban held the city of Kunduz, Afghanistan, 
        which is the first time the Taliban have held a major city in 
        Afghanistan in 14 years.
            (13) The Haqqani Network, a designated foreign terrorist 
        organization aligned with the Taliban, is the most lethal group 
        on the battlefield in Afghanistan, and continues to provide 
        safe haven to al-Qaeda.
            (14) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has 
        established an affiliate in Afghanistan.
            (15) Since the death of the Taliban's leader, Mullah 
        Mohammad Omar, and the ascendance of Mullah Akhtar Mansoor and 
        Saraj Haqqani, head of the Haqqani Network, to Taliban 
        leadership, the Taliban have not engaged in political 
        reconciliation negotiations with the Government of Afghanistan.
            (16) The President has the statutory, legal authority to 
        strike the Taliban and the Haqqani Network.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should authorize at least 9,800 United 
        States troops to continue the train, advise, and assist and 
        counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan after 2016;
            (2) the President should provide the United States 
        commander in Afghanistan with the authority to unilaterally 
        strike the Taliban and the Haqqani Network;
            (3) the President should provide additional resources to 
        strike the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 
        Afghanistan;
            (4) the President should provide the United States 
        commander in Afghanistan the authority to conduct the train, 
        advise, and assist mission below the corps level of the Afghan 
        National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF);
            (5) the United States should provide United States Armed 
        Forces lift and close air support to ANDSF units until the 
        ANDSF has a fully capable, organic lift and close air support 
        capability and capacity;
            (6) the United States should provide monetary and advisory 
        support for 352,000 ANDSF personnel and 30,000 Afghan Local 
        Police, including intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance support, through 2018;
            (7) it should continue to be a top priority to provide 
        United States Armed Forces deployed to Afghanistan with 
        necessary medical, force protection, and combat search and 
        rescue support; and
            (8) United States military personnel who are tasked with 
        the mission of providing combat search and rescue support, 
        casualty evacuation, and medical support should not be counted 
        as part of any force management level limitation on the number 
        of United States ground forces in Afghanistan.

        appropriate equipment directly to the Kurdistan Regional

                            (iii) Whether any new agreements would be 
                        needed to provide enhanced access to such 
                        commercial imagery or other capabilities and 
                        what would be required to obtain such 
                        agreements.
                            (iv) Whether transitioning to such 
                        commercial imagery or other capabilities from 
                        the current imagery sharing through the Open 
                        Skies Treaty would reduce opportunities by the 
                        Russian Federation to exceed imagery limits and 
                        reduce utility for Russian intelligence 
                        collection against the United States or covered 
                        state parties.
                            (v) How such commercial imagery or other 
                        capabilities would compare to the current 
                        imagery sharing through the Open Skies Treaty.
                    (B) The Secretary of State, in consultation with 
                the Director of the National Geospatial Intelligence 
                Agency and the Secretary of Defense, submits to the 
                appropriate congressional committees an unclassified 
                report that--
                            (i) details the costs for implementation of 
                        the Open Skies Treaty, including--
                                    (I) mitigation costs relating to 
                                national security; and
                                    (II) aircraft, sensors, and related 
                                overhead and treaty implementation 
                                costs for covered state parties; and
                            (ii) describes the impact on contributions 
                        by covered state parties and relationships 
                        among covered state parties in the context of 
                        the Open Skies Treaty, the North Atlantic 
                        Treaty Organization, and any other venues for 
                        United States partnership dialogue and 
                        activity.

SEC. 1234. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON UNITED STATES EFFORTS IN EUROPE TO 
              REASSURE UNITED STATES PARTNERS AND ALLIES AND DETER 
              AGGRESSION BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Russian Federation, under the leadership of 
        President Vladimir Putin, continues to demonstrate its intent 
        to expand its sphere of influence and limit Western influence 
        both regionally and globally.
            (2) In March 2016, at a House Armed Services Committee 
        hearing discussing worldwide threats, Major General James 
        Marrs, Director for Intelligence in the Joint Staff stated, 
        ``principally, what we are seeing in Russia. . .is just a 
        breadth of capabilities from strategic systems to anti access 
        area denial to even, I would say, a growing adeptness at 
        operating sort of just short of traditional military conflict 
        that is posing a significant challenge in the future''.
            (3) In July 2015, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
        General Joseph Dunford, testified to the Senate Armed Services 
        Committee, that ``Russia presents the greatest threat to our 
        national security''. In November 2015, Secretary of Defense, 
        Ashton Carter, discussed the need for ``adapting our 
        operational posture and contingency plans. . .to deter Russia's 
        aggression''.
            (4) In February 2016, the Rand Corporation released its 
        report, ``Reinforcing Deterrence on NATO's Eastern Flank'', 
        concluding that at a maximum it would take Russian forces 
        approximately 60 hours to reach the capitals of Estonia and 
        Latvia, exhibiting the challenge to North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) member countries of successfully defending 
        such territory with its current posture and capability.
            (5) In February 2016, the Center for Strategic and 
        International Studies released its report, ``Evaluating U.S. 
        Army Force Posture in Europe'', calling for increased pre-
        positioned sets of United States military equipment, increased 
        rotational forces and associated enablers, increased logistics 
        capabilities, and increased investment in combating 
        unconventional warfare methods in Europe.
            (6) In February 2016, the National Commission on the Future 
        of the Army released its findings and recommendations, which 
        included Recommendation 14 calling for stationing an Armored 
        Brigade Combat Team Forward in Europe and Recommendation 15 
        calling for the conversion of Army Europe Aviation Headquarters 
        to a warfighting mission command.
            (7) In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2015 (Public Law 114-92) and the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 113-291), 
        Congress authorized approximately $1,800,000,000 for the 
        European Reassurance Initiative to reassure allies through 
        expanded United States military presence in Europe through 
        rotational deployments of United States troops, bilateral and 
        multilateral exercises, improved infrastructure, increased pre-
        positioned United States military equipment, and building 
        partnership capacity.
            (8) The budget of the President for fiscal year 2017 
        submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31, United 
        States Code, includes $3,420,000,000 for the European 
        Reassurance Initiative to begin the transition from primarily 
        reassuring United States partners and allies to deterring the 
        Russian Federation.
            (9) The request encompasses a large increase of 
        conventional resources, including additional rotational 
        deployments of United States troops and pre-positioning an 
        Armored Brigade Combat Team's worth of equipment into Europe.
            (10) The request also includes increased funding for 
        unconventional warfare resources, including cyber and special 
        operations forces, as well as for intelligence and indicators 
        and warning.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--
            (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States to 
        reassure United States partners and allies in Europe and to 
        work with United States partners and allies to deter aggression 
        by the Government of the Russian Federation in order to enhance 
        regional and global security and stability.
            (2) Conduct of policy.--The policy described in paragraph 
        (1) shall, among other things, be carried out through a 
        comprehensive defense strategy and guidance to outline the 
        future path of defense resources and capabilities in the 
        European theater. Such strategy and guidance shall include--
                    (A) use and expansion of conventional methods, 
                including increased United States presence, pre-
                positioning of United States military equipment, 
                increased infrastructure, and building partnership 
                capacity in Europe;
                    (B) emphasis on developing capabilities for 
                countering unconventional methods of warfare, including 
                cyber warfare, economic warfare, information 
                operations, and intelligence operations; and
                    (C) encouraging security assistance and 
                capabilities of partners and allies, including NATO 
                member countries.

                    (B) by striking ``commencing on the date that is 
                six months after the date of the enactment of this 
                Act''.

SEC. 1236. PROHIBITION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS RELATING TO SOVEREIGNTY 
              OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OVER CRIMEA.

    (a) Prohibition.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated 
by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 for the

        interest of the United States; and
            (2) submits to the Committee on Armed Services and the 
        Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the

        time the waiver is invoked.

SEC. 1237. MODIFICATION AND EXTENSION OF REPORT ON MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
              TO UKRAINE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Ukraine's border is 6,995 kilometers long, including 
        1,974 kilometers of controlled border with the Russian 
        Federation, 195 kilometers of an administrative line with 
        Crimea, and 409 kilometers of border in the east that is 
        currently uncontrolled.
            (2) Since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict 
        in 2014, 64 Ukrainian border guards have been killed and 
        another 391 have been wounded.
            (3) Implementation of the Minsk Agreement, signed in 
        February 2015, requires the State Border Guard Service of 
        Ukraine to reestablish border checkpoints in currently 
        uncontrolled territory and to monitor the border to verify full 
        implementation of the Agreement.
            (4) Ukraine is developing engineering and technical systems 
        to strengthen the controlled border between Ukraine and the 
        Russian Federation, Ukrainian maritime borders, and areas 
        adjacent to the uncontrolled territory and occupied Crimea.
            (5) Russian unmanned aerial vehicles are being used to 
        support Russian-backed separatist artillery fire against 
        Ukrainian forces.
            (6) Due to a lack of resources and equipment, Ukraine lacks 
        an effective early warning network to warn of any new 
        aggression on the border.
            (7) Section 1250 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92; 129 Stat. 1068) calls 
        for the United States to provide to Ukraine critical training 
        and equipment to enhance the capabilities of the military and 
        other security forces of Ukraine to defend against further 
        aggression from the Russian Federation and Russian-backed 
        separatists.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should continue to support the 
        Government of Ukraine's efforts to provide and maintain 
        security in Ukraine;
            (2) the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine needs 
        sufficient equipment and technical assistance to defend and 
        monitor Ukraine's borders and to fully implement the Minsk 
        Agreement; and
            (3) the Department of Defense should continue its work with 
        the Ukrainian military, Ukrainian National Guard, and Ukrainian 
        State Border Guard Service to strengthen Ukraine's defenses and 
        defend its borders against aggressive actions.
    (c) Modification and Extension of Report on Military Assistance to 
Ukraine.--
            (1) Congressional committees.--Subsection (b) of section

        adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) A description of the extent to which the Department

SEC. 1241. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MALIGN ACTIVITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF 
              IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the Government of Iran continues 
to conduct provocative, malign activities in the region, including--
            (1) the launch of the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic 
        missile and Qiam-1 short-range ballistic missiles;
            (2) the intent to launch the Simorgh Space-Launch Vehicle 
        (SLV) as stated by Lieutenant General Vincent Stewart in 
        testimony to the House Armed Services Committee: ``Iran stated 
        publicly it intends to launch the Simorgh (SLV), which would be 
        capable of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) range.'';
            (3) the detention of United States service members, which 
        the Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, described in testimony 
        to the House Armed Services Committee as ``unprofessional'' and 
        ``outrageous'';

SEC. 1251. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND 
              LITHUANIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are 
        highly valued allies of the United States, and they have 
        repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to advancing our 
        mutual interests as well as those of the NATO Alliance.
            (2) Operation Atlantic Resolve is a series of exercises and 
        coordinating efforts demonstrating the United States' 
        commitment to its European partners and allies, including the 
        Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, with the 
        shared goal of peace and stability in the region. Operation 
        Atlantic Resolve strengthens communication and understanding, 
        and is an important effort to deter Russian aggression in the 
        region.
            (3) Through Operation Atlantic Resolve, the European 
        Reassurance Initiative undertakes exercises, training, and 
        rotational presence necessary to reassure and integrate our 
        allies, including the Baltic States, into a common defense 
        framework.
            (4) All three Baltic States contributed to the NATO-led 
        International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, sending 
        disproportionate numbers of troops and operating with few 
        caveats. The Baltic States continue to engage in Operation 
        Resolute Support in Afghanistan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its support for the principle of collective 
        defense in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty for our NATO 
        allies, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania;
            (2) supports the sovereignty, independence, territorial 
        integrity, and inviolability of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
        as well as their internationally recognized borders, and 
        expresses concerns over increasingly aggressive military 
        maneuvering by the Russian Federation near their borders and 
        airspace;
            (3) expresses concern over and condemns subversive and 
        destabilizing activities by the Russian Federation within the 
        Baltic States; and
            (4) encourages the Administration to further enhance 
        defense cooperation efforts with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
        and supports the efforts of their Governments to provide for 
        the defense of their people and sovereign territory.

SEC. 1252. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT FOR GEORGIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Georgia is a valued friend of the United States and has 
        repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to advancing the mutual 
        interests of both countries, including the deployment of 
        Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led International Security 
        Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and the Multi-National 
        Force in Iraq.
            (2) The European Reassurance Initiative builds the 
        partnership capacity of Georgia so it can work more closely 
        with the United States and NATO, as well as provide for its own 
        defense.
            (3) In addition to the European Reassurance Initiative, 
        Georgia's participation in the NATO initiative Partnership for 
        Peace is paramount to interoperability with the United States 
        and NATO, and establishing a more peaceful environment in the 
        region.
            (4) Despite the losses suffered, as a NATO partner of ISAF, 
        Georgia is engaged in the Resolute Support Mission in 
        Afghanistan with the second largest contingent on the ground.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms United States support for Georgia's 
        sovereignty and territorial integrity within its 
        internationally-recognized borders, and does not recognize the 
        independence of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions 
        currently occupied by the Russian Federation; and

SEC. 1611. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF NATIONAL SECURITY SPACE 
              ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) National security space capabilities are a vital 
        element of the national defense of the United States.
            (2) The advantages of the United States in national 
        security space are now threatened to an unprecedented degree by 
        growing and serious counterspace capabilities of potential 
        foreign adversaries, and the space advantages of the United 
        States must be protected.
            (3) The Department of Defense has recognized the threat and 
        has taken initial steps necessary to defend space, however the 
        organization and management may not be strategically postured 
        to fully address this changed domain of operations over the 
        long term.
            (4) The defense of space is currently a priority for the 
        leaders of the Department, however the space mission is managed 
        within competing priorities of each of the Armed Forces.
            (5) Space elements provide critical capabilities to all of 
        the Armed Forces in the joint fight, however the disparate 
        activities throughout the Department have no single leader that 
        is empowered to make decisions affecting the space forces of 
        the Department.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to 
modernize and fully address the growing threat to the national security 
space advantage of the United States, the Secretary of Defense must 
evaluate the range of options and take further action to strengthen the 
leadership, management, and organization of the national security space 
activities of the Department of Defense, including with respect to--
            (1) unifying, integrating, and de-conflicting activities to 
        provide for stronger prioritization, accountability, coherency, 
        focus, strategy, and integration of the joint space program of 
        the Department;
            (2) streamlining decision-making, limiting unnecessary 
        bureaucracy, and empowering the appropriate level of authority, 
        while enabling effective oversight;
            (3) maintaining the involvement of each of the Armed Forces 
        and adapting the culture and improving the capabilities of the 
        workforce to ensure the workforce has the appropriate training, 
        experience, and tools to accomplish the mission; and
            (4) reviewing authorities and preparing for a conflict that 
        could extend to space.
    (c) Recommendations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget shall each separately submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees recommendations, in accordance 
with subsection (b), to strengthen the leadership, management, and 
organization of the Department of Defense with respect to the national 
security space activities of the Department.
    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section, the 
term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:
            (1) The congressional defense committees.
            (2) The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
        House of Representatives and the Select Committee on

        deterrent and decision-making of the United Kingdom provides a 
        crucial contribution to international stability, the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance, and the national 
        security of the United States;
            (2) nuclear deterrence is and will continue to be the 
        highest priority mission of the Department of Defense and the 
        United States benefits when the closest ally of the United 
        States clearly and unequivocally sets similar priorities;
            (3) the United States sees the nuclear deterrent of the 
        United Kingdom as central to trans-Atlantic security and to the 
        commitment of the United Kingdom to NATO to spend two percent 
        of gross domestic product on defense;
            (4) the commitment of the United Kingdom to maintain a 
        continuous at-sea deterrence posture today and in the future 
        complements the deterrent capabilities of the United States and 
        provides a credible ``second center of decision making'' which 
        ensures potential attackers cannot discount the solidarity of 
        the mutual relationship of the United States and the United 
        Kingdom;
            (5) the United States Navy must execute the Ohio-class 
        replacement submarine program on time and within budget, 
        seeking efficiencies and cost savings wherever possible, to 
        ensure that the program delivers a Common Missile Compartment, 
        the Trident II (D5) Strategic Weapon System, and associated 
        equipment and production capabilities, that support the 
        successful development and deployment of the Vanguard-successor 
        submarines of the United Kingdom; and
            (6) the close technical collaboration, especially expert 
        mutual scientific peer review, provides valuable resilience and 
        cost effectiveness to the respective deterrence programs of the 
        United States and the United Kingdom.

    (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to maintain and 
improve a robust layered missile defense system capable of defending 
the territory of the United States, allies, deployed forces, and 
capabilities against the developing and increasingly complex ballistic 
missile threat with funding subject to the annual authorization of 
appropriations and the annual appropriation of funds for National 
Missile Defense.
    (b) Conforming Repeal.--Section 2 of the National Missile Defense 
Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) is repealed.

SEC. 1666. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INITIAL OPERATING CAPABILITY OF PHASE 2 
              OF EUROPEAN PHASED ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Obama, during his announcement of the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach on September 17, 2009, 
        stated, ``This approach is based on an assessment of the 
        Iranian missile threat,'' and ``the best way to responsibly 
        advance our security and the security of our allies is to 
        deploy a missile defense system that best responds to the 
        threats we face and that utilizes technology that is both 
        proven and cost-effective.''.
            (2) The 2010 Ballistic Missile Defense review stated that 
        ``The [European] Phased Adaptive Approach utilizes existing and 
        proven capabilities to meet current threats and then will 
        improve upon these capabilities over time by integrating new 
        technology.''.
            (3) Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, during a speech in 
        Brussels on October 5, 2011, stated, ``The United States is 
        fully committed to building a missile defense capability for 
        the full coverage and protection of all our NATO European 
        populations, their territory and their forces against the 
        growing threat posed by ballistic missiles.''.
            (4) Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, during a press 
        conference on March 15, 2013, stated, ``The missile deployments 
        the United States is making in phases one through three of the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach, including sites in Romania 
        and Poland, will still be able to provide coverage of all 
        European NATO territory as planned by 2018.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States is committed to the defense of 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces of the United States and 
        to the defense of the European allies of the Unites States by 
        increasing the ballistic missile defense capability of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in this section referred to 
        as ``NATO'');
            (2) phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach will 
        provide NATO with a substantial increase in ballistic missile 
        defense capability since NATO declared Interim Ballistic 
        Missile Defense Capability at the Chicago Summit in 2012, and 
        such phase consists of--
                    (A) Aegis Ashore in Romania;
                    (B) four Aegis ballistic missile defense capable 
                ships homeported at Rota, Spain; and
                    (C) a more capable SM-3 interceptor;
            (3) NATO is moving forward with the modernization of the 
        defense capabilities of NATO that is responsive to 21st century 
        threats to the territory and populations of member states of 
        NATO;
            (4) the member states of NATO recognize the importance of 
        this contribution, which sends a clear signal that NATO will 
        not allow potential adversaries to threaten the use of 
        ballistic missile strikes to coerce NATO or deter NATO from 
        responding to aggression against the interests of NATO; and
            (5) phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        ready for 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation, with 
        proven military systems and command and control capability, and 
        should be so declared at the July 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, 
        Poland.

              PROCUREMENTS.

    Section 15(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(a)) is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) Small Business Procurements.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this Act, small business 
        concerns shall receive any award or contract if such award or

        contracting agency, in the interest of--
                    ``(A) maintaining or mobilizing the full productive 
                capacity of the United States;

                under paragraph (2)) are awarded to small business

                business size standards, except that the Administrator 
                shall limit an industry category to a greater extent 
                than provided under the North American Industry 
                Classification codes if the Administrator receives 
                evidence indicating that further segmentation of the

                small business concerns as prime contractors unlikely,

                department or agency for a determination.

        respect to a contract for the sale of Government property, 
        small business concerns shall receive any such contract if, in 
        the determination of the Administrator and the disposal agency, 
        the award of such contract is in the interest of assuring that 
        a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be 
        made to small business concerns.

        in this subsection shall be construed to change any preferences 
        or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of 
        electrical power or other property by the Federal Government.

        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Navy shall submit a 
        report to the congressional defense committees regarding the 
        status of the implementation of the ``net negative'' policy 
        regarding the total number of acres of the real property 
        controlled by the Department of the Navy on Guam, as described 
        in subsection (b).
            (2) Contents.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include the following information:
                    (A) A description of the real property controlled 
                by the Navy on Guam which the Navy has transferred to 
                the control of Guam after January 20, 2011, or which 
                the Navy plans to transfer to the control of Guam, as 
                well as a description of the specific legal authority 
                under which the Navy has transferred or will transfer 
                each such property.
                    (B) The methodology and process the Navy will use 
                to determine the total number of acres of real property 
                that the Navy will transfer or has transferred to the 
                control of Guam as part of the ``net negative'' policy, 
                and the date on which the Navy will transfer or has 
                transferred control of any such property.
                    (C) A description of the real property controlled 
                by the Navy on Guam which the Navy plans to retain 
                under its control and the reasons for retaining such 
                property, including a detailed explanation of the 
                reasons for retaining any such property which has not 
                been developed or for which no development has been 
                proposed under the current installation master plans 
                for major military installations (as described in 
                section 2864 of title 10, United States Code).
            (3) Exclusion of certain property.--In preparing and 
        submitting the report under this subsection, the Secretary may

        identified prior to January 20, 2011, as property to be 
        transferred to the Government of Guam under the Guam Excess 
        Lands Act (Public Law 103-339) or the Guam Land Use Plan (GLUP) 
        1977, or pursuant to base realignment and closure authorized 
        under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 
        (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 
        note), whether or not the Navy transferred control of any such 
        property to Guam at any time.
    (b) Policy Described.--The ``net negative'' policy described in 
this section is the policy of the Secretary of the Navy, as expressed 
in the statement released by Under Secretary of the Navy on January 20, 
2011, that the relocation of Marines to Guam occurring during 2011 will 
not cause the total number of acres of real property controlled by the 
Navy on Guam upon the completion of such relocation to exceed the total 
number of acres of real property controlled by the Navy on Guam prior 
to such relocation.

his or her sole discretion, defer the effective date of a sentence of 
confinement, reduction, or forfeiture. The deferment shall terminate 
upon entry of judgment or, in the case of a summary court-martial, when 
the convening authority acts on the sentence. The deferment may be 
rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the accused 
is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general 
court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is 
currently assigned.
    ``(2) In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person 
referred to in paragraph (3) to confinement, the convening authority
