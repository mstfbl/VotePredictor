                Congress is primarily responsible for bringing Iran to 
                the table to negotiate on its nuclear program;
                    ``(B) these negotiations are a critically important 
                matter of national security and foreign policy for the

                Congress for the agreement to commence;

                and only Congress can permanently modify or eliminate 
                that regime, it is critically important that Congress 
                have the opportunity, in an orderly and deliberative 
                manner, to consider and, as appropriate, take action 
                affecting the statutory sanctions regime imposed by 
                Congress.

                period for review provided in subsection (b), there is 
                enacted a joint resolution stating in substance that

                the period for review provided in subsection (b), there 
                is not enacted any such joint resolution.
            ``(3) Definition.--For the purposes of this subsection, the 
        phrase `action involving any measure of statutory sanctions 
        relief by the United States' shall include waiver, suspension, 
        reduction, or other effort to provide relief from, or otherwise

        potentially significant breach or compliance incident by Iran 
        with respect to an agreement subject to subsection (a), submit 
        such information to the appropriate congressional committees 
        and leadership.

        days after submitting information about a potentially 
        significant breach or compliance incident pursuant to paragraph 
        (2), the President shall make a determination whether such 
        potentially significant breach or compliance issue constitutes 
        a material breach and, if there is such a material breach, 
        whether Iran has cured such material breach, and shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees and leadership such 
        determination, accompanied by, as appropriate, a report on the 
        action or failure to act by Iran that led to the material

        congressional committees and leadership a report on Iran's 
        nuclear program and the compliance of Iran with the agreement 
        during the period covered by the report, including the 
        following elements:
