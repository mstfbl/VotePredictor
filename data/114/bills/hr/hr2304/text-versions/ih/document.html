``Sec. 4203. Stay of discovery

filing of a special motion to dismiss under section 4202, discovery 
proceedings in the action shall be stayed until a final and 
unappealable order is entered on such motion unless good cause is shown

information. If the party filing a motion to quash makes a prima facie 
showing that the order is for personally identifying information, then 
the motion shall be granted and the order to produce the personally 
identifying information shall be quashed, unless the responding party 
demonstrates with an evidentiary showing that the claim is likely to 
succeed on the merits of each and every element of the claim, in which 
case the motion to quash shall be denied. No determinations made in

        section 4202(a) may be removed to the district court of the 
        United States for the judicial district and division embracing 
        the place where the civil action is pending. The grounds for 
        removal provided in this section need not appear on the face of 
        the complaint but may be shown in the petition for removal.
            ``(2) Exception.--Removal may not be requested under 
        paragraph (1) on the basis of a third-party claim or a cross 
        claim asserted by a defendant.
            ``(3) Remand.--If a civil action is removed under paragraph 
        (1) and an order denying in its entirety a motion to dismiss 
        filed under section 4202 is not appealed within the time 
        permitted by law or all potential appellate proceedings have 
        been exhausted, the court shall remand the remaining claims to 
        the State court from which the civil action was removed. The 
        remaining claims shall not be remanded to State court if the 
        order granted a motion to dismiss in part and such order is not 
        appealed within the time permitted by law or all potential 
        appellate proceedings have been exhausted.

request or order that reasonably appears to be a request or order 
described in section 4205 is sought or issued may be removed to the 
district court of the United States for the judicial district and

asserts a defense based on the First Amendment to the Constitution or 
laws of the United States.

court shall award a person that files and prevails on a motion to 
dismiss under section 4202 or a motion to quash under section 4205, 
litigation costs, expert witness fees, and reasonable attorneys fees. A 
party shall be a prevailing party as to a special motion to dismiss or 
to quash if a claim or discovery request is voluntarily dismissed or 
withdrawn after the filing of a special motion to dismiss.
    ``(b) Frivolous Motions to Dismiss.--Except as provided in 
subsection (c), if a court finds that a motion to dismiss under section 
4202, a motion to quash under section 4205, or a notice of removal 
under section 4206 is frivolous or is solely intended to cause 
unnecessary delay, the court shall award litigation costs, expert 
witness fees, and reasonable attorneys fees to the party that responded 
to the motion or notice.
