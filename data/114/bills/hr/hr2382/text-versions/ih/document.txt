    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to 
 authorize a parent to opt their child out of participation in certain 
                  assessments required under such Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Enable More Parents to Opt-Out 
Without Endangering Resources Act''.

SEC. 2. ASSESSMENT OPT-OUT FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS.

    Section 1111(b)(2) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(2)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (C)(iv), by inserting ``subject to 
        subparagraph (L),'' before ``measures the progress'';
            (2) in subparagraph (I)(ii), by inserting ``, and the 95 
        percent requirement described in this clause shall exclude any 
        student who, pursuant to subparagraph (L), opts out of the 
        assessments'' after ``about an individual student''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(L) Opt-out for certain students.--Upon the 
                request of the parent of a student, and for any reason 
                stated by the parent, a State shall allow the student 
                to opt out of the assessments described in paragraph 
                (3). Such an opt-out, or any action related to it, may 
                not be used by the Secretary, the State, any State or 
                local agency, or any school leader or employee as the 
                basis for any corrective action, penalty, or other 
                consequence against the parent, the student, any school 
                leader or employee, or the school.''.
                                 <all>
