                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 
     to designate the Sonoran Corridor connecting Interstate 19 to 
  Interstate 10 south of the Tucson International Airport as a future 
         part of the Interstate System, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sonoran Corridor Interstate 
Development Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    Congress finds that the designation of the Sonoran Corridor 
Interstate connecting Interstate 19 to Interstate 10 south of the 
Tucson International Airport as a future part of the Interstate System 
would--
            (1) enhance direct linkage between major trading routes 
        connecting growing ports, agricultural regions, infrastructure 
        and manufacturing centers, and existing high priority corridors 
        of the National Highway System; and
            (2) significantly improve connectivity on the future 
        Interstate 11 and the CANAMEX Corridor, a route directly 
        linking the United States with Mexico and Canada.

SEC. 3. ROUTE DESIGNATION.

    (a) High Priority Corridor on National Highway System.--Section 
1105(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 
(105 Stat. 2032; 119 Stat. 1210) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
            ``(81) State Route 410, the Sonoran Corridor connecting 
        Interstate 19 to Interstate 10 south of the Tucson 
        International Airport.''.
    (b) Future Parts of Interstate System.--Section 1105(e)(5)(A) of 
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (105 Stat. 
2033; 119 Stat. 1213) is amended in the first sentence by striking 
``and subsection (c)(57)'' and inserting ``subsection (c)(57), and 
subsection (c)(81)''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
