        businesses to share their State examinations with depository 
        institutions and credit unions, or if another mechanism could 
        be found to allow a similar exchange of information that would 
        give such depository institutions and credit unions a better 
        understanding of whether an individual money services business 
        is adequately meeting its anti-money laundering and counter 
        terror financing obligations to combat money laundering, the 
        financing of terror, or related illicit finance.

SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury, 
acting in the Secretary's own capacity and through the Under Secretary 
for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, should work with finance ministry 
counterparts worldwide to spur the development within such ministries 
of entities similar to the Department of the Treasury's Office of 
Intelligence and Analysis to more solidly integrate the intelligence 
community with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing 
efforts.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 11, 2016.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
