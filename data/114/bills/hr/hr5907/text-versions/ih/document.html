                                 A BILL


 
  To preserve competition among mortgage lenders, provide relief from 
 unnecessary regulatory requirements on responsible community mortgage 
                    lenders, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Mortgage Lender Regulatory 
Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Responsible community mortgage lenders engaged in 
        traditional mortgage lending were not responsible for the 
        recent mortgage crisis.
            (2) Responsible community mortgage lenders provide a 
        valuable and critical service to consumers by, among other 
        things, fulfilling the housing finance needs of the communities 
        they serve and providing locally based alternative sources for 
        mortgage financing.
            (3) The activities and business practices of responsible 
        community mortgage lenders do not pose a substantial risk to 
        consumers, and did not pose a substantial risk to consumers 
        when the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
        Act was enacted.
            (4) Responsible community mortgage lenders are subject to 
        the oversight and control of various governmental authorities 
        and nongovernmental actors, including the Bureau of Consumer 
        Financial Protection, the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development, the Federal Trade Commission, State supervisory 
        regulators, local government supervisory regulators, mortgage 
        loan investors, warehouse lenders, and various other 
        authorities or entities. As a result of this oversight and 
        control, the business practices and activities of responsible 
        community mortgage lenders are safe, transparent to the public 
        and the government, and do not pose a threat to consumers, the 
        public at large, the United States financial markets, or the 
        United States economy in general.
            (5) Responsible community mortgage lenders are unreasonably 
        burdened by increasing regulation geared to problems that they 
        did not create and activities that they did not and do not 
        engage in, and therefore responsible community mortgage lenders 
        are entitled to relief from certain provisions of the Dodd-
        Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and its 
        attendant regulations, including the regulations of the Bureau 
        of Consumer Financial Protection.
            (6) Without relief many responsible community mortgage 
        lenders will be driven from the market thus limiting the 
        consumer's ability to choose a local lender for mortgage 
        financing and dangerously consolidating the mortgage lending 
        market into a smaller number of lenders.
            (7) The preservation of responsible community mortgage 
        lenders is critical to preserving competition and preventing 
        increasing concentration in mortgage lending.
            (8) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection should 
        prioritize its resources and ability to carry out examinations 
        by creating reasonable exclusions for smaller, responsible 
        mortgage lenders.
