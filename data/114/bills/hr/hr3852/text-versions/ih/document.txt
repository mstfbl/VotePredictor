                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on the benefits of 
           solar net energy metering, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. STUDY AND REPORT ON BENEFITS OF SOLAR NET ENERGY METERING.

    (a) Study and Report.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a 
        study on solar net energy metering. The study shall include an 
        analysis of any benefits that may result from implementing 
        solar net energy metering, including any resulting--
                    (A) reduction in demand on the grid during peak 
                hours;
                    (B) increased grid security through localized grid 
                support;
                    (C) creation of jobs related to solar energy, 
                including jobs in production, construction, and 
                installation, increasing the tax base for State and 
                local governments;
                    (D) avoidance of energy-related expenditures by 
                electric consumers that enables such electric consumers 
                to increase discretionary spending and stimulate local 
                economies;
                    (E) reduction in air pollution and associated 
                health risks;
                    (F) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 
                associated climate change impacts;
                    (G) assistance to electric utilities in meeting 
                applicable renewable portfolio standards;
                    (H) reduction in water usage as compared to the 
                amount of water used in fossil-fuel-based electricity 
                production;
                    (I) reduction in electricity cost for electric 
                consumers as a result of reduced demand for centrally 
                supplied electricity;
                    (J) avoided cost in energy generation, deferred 
                capacity, and grid support services to electric 
                utilities by or on behalf of an electric consumer;
                    (K) avoided cost to electric utilities for fuel 
                price hedging otherwise needed to guarantee that a 
                portion of electricity supply costs are fixed; and
                    (L) increase in the availability of private capital 
                to individuals generating electricity through use of 
                solar power based on the stable assumptions solar net 
                energy metering provides for financial institutions.
            (2) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to 
        Congress a report containing the results of the study required 
        to be conducted under paragraph (1).
    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:
            (1) Eligible solar generating facility.--The term 
        ``eligible solar generating facility'' means a facility that 
        produces electric energy solely by the use, as a primary energy 
        source, of solar energy.
            (2) Primary energy source.--The term ``primary energy 
        source'' has the meaning given such term in section 3 of the 
        Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796).
            (3) Solar net energy metering.--The term ``solar net energy 
        metering'' means service to an electric consumer under which 
        electric energy generated by such electric consumer from an on-
        site eligible solar generating facility and delivered to local 
        distribution facilities may be used to offset electric energy 
        provided by an electric utility to the electric consumer during 
        the applicable billing period.
            (4) Electric utility; electric consumer.--The terms 
        ``electric utility'' and ``electric consumer'' have the 
        meanings given such terms in section 3 of the Public Utility 
        Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2602).
