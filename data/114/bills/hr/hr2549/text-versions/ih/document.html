                164.501 of part 164); and
            ``(2) the Secretary shall further revise or clarify the

        of part 164 does not apply to disclosures that are described by 
        subsection (a).
    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--This section shall not be construed as 
prohibiting or restricting a use or disclosure of protected health 
information for research purposes that is otherwise permitted under 
part 164.

``SEC. 13443. TREATING DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION FOR 
              RESEARCH SIMILARLY TO DISCLOSURES OF SUCH INFORMATION FOR 
              PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES.

    ``(b) Permitted Uses and Disclosures.--The Secretary shall revise 
or clarify the Rule so that research activities, including comparative

which a covered entity may disclose protected health information to a 
person described in section 164.512(b)(1)(iii) of part 164.

``SEC. 13444. PERMITTING REMOTE ACCESS TO PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION 
              BY RESEARCHERS.

the removal of protected health information by a researcher) shall not 
prohibit remote access to health information by a researcher so long 
as--
            ``(1) appropriate security and privacy safeguards are 
        maintained by the covered entity and the researcher; and
            ``(2) the protected health information is not copied or 
        otherwise retained by the researcher.

``SEC. 13445. ALLOWING ONE-TIME AUTHORIZATION OF USE AND DISCLOSURE OF 
              PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall revise or clarify the Rule 
to specify that an authorization for the use or disclosure of protected 
health information, with respect to an individual, for future research 
purposes shall be deemed to contain a sufficient description of the 
purpose of the use or disclosure if the authorization--
            ``(1) sufficiently describes the purposes such that it 
        would be reasonable for the individual to expect that the 
        protected health information could be used or disclosed for 
        such future research;
            ``(2) either--
                    ``(A) states that the authorization will expire on 
                a particular date or on the occurrence of a particular 
                event; or
                    ``(B) states that the authorization will remain 
                valid unless and until it is revoked by the individual; 
                and
            ``(3) provides instruction to the individual on how to 
        revoke such authorization at any time.
    ``(b) Revocation of Authorization.--The Secretary shall revise or 
clarify the Rule to specify that, if an individual revokes an 
authorization for future research purposes such as is described by 
subsection (a), the covered entity may not make any further uses or 
disclosures based on that authorization, except, as provided in 
paragraph (b)(5) of section 164.508 of part 164, to the extent that the 
covered entity has taken action in reliance on the authorization.''.
    (b) Revision of Regulations.--Not later than 12 months after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services shall revise and clarify the provisions of title 45, Code of 
Federal Regulations, for consistency with part 4 of subtitle D of the 
HITECH Act, as added by subsection (a).
