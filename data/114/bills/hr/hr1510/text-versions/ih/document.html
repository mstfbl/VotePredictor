                                 A BILL


 
      To require that overseas contingency operations be paid for.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REQUIREMENT THAT OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS BE PAID 
              FOR.

    (a) Amounts Appropriated for Fiscal Year 2015.--No amount otherwise 
made available for Overseas Contingency Operations for fiscal year 2015 
may be obligated during the period beginning on the date which is 90 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act and ending on the date 
of the enactment of a law which includes provisions which increase 
revenues by not less than the aggregate amount appropriated for 
Overseas Contingency Operations for fiscal year 2015. A provision to 
increase revenue shall not be taken into account under the preceding 
sentence unless the law which includes such provision includes a 
statement that specifically indicates that such provision is to be 
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the requirement of this 
subsection.
    (b) Point of Order Regarding Increased Funding for Overseas 
Contingency Operations.--Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives is amended by adding at the end the following new 
clause:
    ``12. It shall not be in order to consider a bill or joint 
resolution, or an amendment thereto or conference report thereon, if 
the provisions of such measure increase amounts made available for 
Overseas Contingency Operations for any fiscal year, unless such 
measure includes provisions which increase revenues by not less than 
the increase in Overseas Contingency Operations for that fiscal 
year.''.
