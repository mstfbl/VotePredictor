SEC. 2. REVIEW OF UNIVERSITY-BASED CENTERS.

    (a) GAO Study of University-Based Centers.--Not later than 120 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the 
United States shall initiate a study to assess the university-based 
centers for homeland security program authorized by section 308(b)(2) 
of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 188(b)(2)), and provide 
recommendations to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs of the Senate for appropriate improvements.
    (b) Subject Matters.--The study under subsection (a) shall include 
the following:
            (1) A review of the Department of Homeland Security's 
        efforts to identify key areas of study needed to support the 
        homeland security mission, and criteria that the Department 
        utilized to determine those key areas for which the Department 
        should maintain, establish, or eliminate university-based 
        centers.
            (2) A review of the method by which university-based 
        centers, federally funded research and development centers, and 
        Department of Energy national laboratories receive tasking from 
        the Department of Homeland Security, including a review of how 
        university-based research is identified, prioritized, and 
        funded.
            (3) A review of selection criteria for designating 
        university-based centers and a weighting of such criteria.
            (4) An examination of best practices from other agencies' 
        efforts to organize and use university-based research to 
        support their missions.
            (5) A review of the Department of Homeland Security's 
        criteria and metrics to measure demonstrable progress achieved 
        by university-based centers in fulfilling Department taskings, 
        and mechanisms for delivering and disseminating the research 
        results of designated university-based centers within the 
        Department and to other Federal, State, and local agencies.
            (6) An examination of the means by which academic 
        institutions that are not designated or associated with the 
        designated university-based centers can optimally contribute to 
        the research mission of the Directorate of Science and 
        Technology of the Department of Homeland Security.
            (7) An assessment of the interrelationship between the 
        different university-based centers and the degree to which 
        outreach and collaboration among a diverse array of academic 
        institutions is encouraged by the Department of Homeland 
        Security, particularly with historically Black colleges and 
        universities and minority serving institutions.
            (8) A review of any other essential elements of the 
        programs determined in the conduct of the study.
    (c) Information Relating to University-Based Centers.--Subparagraph 
(D) of section 308(b)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 
188(b)(2)) is amended to read as follows:
