        paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (c) of section 502 of

                    (D) the President determines, after receiving the 
                advice of the United States International Trade 
                Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 
                Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), that the article

                    (E) subject to paragraph (3), the sum of the cost 
                or value of the materials produced in, and the direct

        pursuant to paragraph (1) that textile and apparel articles

        United States, the Commissioner shall report that determination 
        to the President.

SEC. 5. TRADE FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As a land-locked least-developed country, Nepal has 
        severe challenges reaching markets and developing capacity to 
        export goods. As of 2015, exports from Nepal are approximately 
        $800,000,000 per year, with India the major market at 
        $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports about 
        $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of the 
        total goods exported from Nepal.
            (2) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall 
        export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since 2005. 
        Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization for 
        Economic Co-operation and Development found that export costs 
        in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and container 
        shipments relative to other low-income countries. Such indices 
        also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal with respect to 
        automation of customs and other trade functions, involvement of 
        local exporters and importers in preparing regulations and 
        trade rules, and export finance.
            (3) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade 
        Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly 
        address some of the weaknesses described in paragraph (2).
    (b) Establishment of Trade Facilitation and Capacity Building 
Program.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the President shall, in consultation with the Government of 
Nepal, establish a trade facilitation and capacity building program for 
Nepal--
            (1) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal 
        to support successful exporters and to build awareness among 
        potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and 
        ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the 
        United States and other countries;
            (2) to provide export finance training for financial 
        institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;
            (3) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining 
        publication of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and 
        importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation 
        relating to exporting goods on the Internet and developing a 
        robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade 
        Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for 
        implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for 
        under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade 
        Organization; and
            (4) to increase access to guides for importers and 
        exporters on the Internet, including rules and documentation 
        for United States tariff preference programs.

SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.

    Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall monitor, review, and 
report to Congress on the implementation of this Act, the compliance of 
Nepal with section 3(a), and the trade and investment policy of the 
United States with respect to Nepal.

SEC. 7. TERMINATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.

    No preferential treatment extended under this Act shall remain in 
effect after December 31, 2025.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The provisions of this Act shall take effect on January 1, 2016.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
