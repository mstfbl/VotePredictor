 To amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. PREVENTION OF FRAUDULENT JOINDER.

    Section 1447(c) of title 28, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following: ``A motion for remand, and any 
opposition thereto, may include affidavit or other evidence showing a 
plausible claim for relief against each nondiverse defendant, or the 
lack thereof, or indicating a good faith intention to prosecute the 
action against each nondiverse defendant or to seek a joint judgment, 
or the lack of such a good faith intent. The district court shall deny 
a motion to remand if it finds that the complaint does not state a 
plausible claim for relief against a nondiverse defendant under 
applicable State law or there is no good faith intention to prosecute 
the action against a nondiverse defendant or to seek a joint 
judgment.''.
