at the displayed ultrasound images.

``SEC. 3403. EXCEPTION FOR MEDICAL EMERGENCIES.

    ``(a) Exception.--The provisions of section 3402 shall not apply to 
an abortion provider if the abortion is necessary to save the life of a

illness, or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical 
condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
    ``(b) Certification.--Upon a determination by an abortion provider 
under subsection (a) that an abortion is necessary to save the life of 
a mother, such provider shall include in the medical file of the

such requirements that are more extensive than those provided under the 
amendment made by this Act.
