                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a grant program to 
    provide supportive services in permanent supportive housing for 
 chronically homeless individuals and families, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Services for Ending Long-Term 
Homelessness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Nationally, on any given night, there are approximately 
        84,291 people who are experiencing chronic homelessness, 
        including some families with children. Chronically homeless 
        people often live in shelters or on the streets for years at a 
        time, experience repeated episodes of homelessness without 
        achieving housing stability, or cycle between homelessness, 
        jails, mental health facilities, and hospitals.
            (2) In 2003, the President Bush's New Freedom Commission on 
        Mental Health recommended the development and implementation of 
        a comprehensive plan designed to facilitate access to 150,000 
        units of permanent supportive housing for consumers and 
        families who are chronically homeless. The Commission found 
        that affordable housing alone is insufficient for many people 
        with severe mental illness, and that flexible, mobile, 
        individualized support services are also necessary to support 
        and sustain consumers in their housing. Since the Commission 
        made the recommendations, approximately 60,000 units of 
        permanent supportive housing have been developed and currently 
        another 30,000 are under development. However, funding for the 
        services continues to be an ongoing problem even with respect 
        to existing service providers.
            (3) The HEARTH Act, enacted on May 20, 2009, as part of the 
        Helping Families Save Their Homes Act (Public Law 111-22), 
        charged the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness 
        (USICH) with developing a national strategic plan to end 
        homelessness. The plan set out goals of ending chronic 
        homelessness within the next 5 years and ending homelessness 
        for families, youth, and children within the next 10 years. As 
        a result, funding for the Homeless Assistance Grants has nearly 
        doubled since fiscal year 2000, reaching $1.9 billion in fiscal 
        year 2013. Despite funding increases, the need to renew 
        existing grants required nearly 90 percent of the competitive 
        grant allocation in fiscal year 2011, and in fiscal year 2012 
        HUD was uncertain whether program funding would be sufficient 
        to renew existing grants.
            (4) By implementing permanent supportive housing, 
        communities are making progress toward ending chronic 
        homelessness.
            (5) Permanent supportive housing is a proven and cost-
        effective solution to chronic homelessness. Research indicates 
        that this combination of long-term housing and wraparound 
        services leads to improved residential stability and reduction 
        in psychiatric symptoms. Studies have also found that 
        supportive housing is associated with significant reductions in 
        costs for emergency room visits, hospitalizations, shelters, 
        sobering centers, jails, and other public services used by 
        people experiencing homelessness. A 2007 study of progress in 
        Portland, Oregon, in ending chronic homelessness found that the 
        city and county saved $15,000 per person involved per year by 
        housing chronically homeless individuals. Also, a 2009 study in 
        Seattle illustrated that one program saved $29,388 per person 
        involved per year by implementing permanent supportive housing.
            (6) Current programs for funding services in permanent 
        supportive housing, other than those administered by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development, were not designed 
        to be closely coordinated with housing resources, nor were they 
        designed to meet the multiple needs of people who are 
        chronically homeless.
            (7) With deep cuts to many housing and safety-net programs, 
        without help from Congress there is a high risk that 
        homelessness will increase.

SEC. 3. DUTIES OF ADMINISTRATOR OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH 
              SERVICES ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 501(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
290aa(d)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (17), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (18), by striking the period and inserting 
        ``; and''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(19) collaborate with Federal departments and programs 
        that are part of the President's Interagency Council on 
        Homelessness, particularly the Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development, the Department of Labor, and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs, and with other agencies within the Department 
        of Health and Human Services, particularly the Health Resources 
        and Services Administration, the Administration on Children and 
        Families, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to 
        design national strategies for providing services in supportive 
        housing that will assist in ending chronic homelessness and to 
        implement programs that address chronic homelessness.''.

        have the experience, infrastructure, and expertise needed to 
        ensure the quality and effectiveness of services, which may be 
        demonstrated by any of the following:

                State requirements for licensing, accreditation, or 
                certification (if any) which are applicable to the 
                proposed project.

            ``(2) There is a mechanism for determining whether 
        residents of permanent supportive housing are chronically 
        homeless individuals or families. Such a mechanism may rely on 
        local data systems or records of shelter admission. If there 
        are no sources of data regarding the duration or number of 
        homeless episodes, or if such data are unreliable for the 
        purposes of this subsection, an applicant must demonstrate that 
        the project will implement appropriate procedures, taking into 
        consideration the capacity of local homeless service providers 
        to document episodes of homelessness and the challenges of 
        engaging individuals and families who have been chronically 
        homeless, to verify that an individual or family is chronically 
        homeless.

                to in this subsection as a `renewal grant'), the period 
                of payments shall not be more than 5 years.
            ``(2) Annual approval; availability of appropriations; 
        number of grants.--The provision of payments under an initial 
        or renewal grant is subject to annual approval by the Secretary 
        of the payments and to the availability of appropriations for 
        the fiscal year involved to make the payments. This subsection 
        may not be construed as establishing a limitation on the number 
        of grants under subsection (a) that may be made to an entity.
            ``(3) Additional provisions regarding renewal grants.--
                    ``(A) Compliance with minimum standards.--A renewal 
                grant may be made by the Secretary only if the

                successful outcomes for housing retention, as 
                determined by the Secretary.
                    ``(B) Amount.--The maximum amount of a renewal 
                grant under this subsection for an applicant shall not 
                exceed an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount of 
                Federal funds provided to the applicant in the final 
                year of the initial grant period.
    ``(k) Strategic Performance Outcomes and Reports.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, as a condition of 
        the receipt of grants under subsection (a), require grantees to 
        provide data regarding the performance outcomes of the projects 
        carried out under the grants. Consistent with the requirements 
        and procedures established by the Secretary, each grantee shall 
        measure and report specific performance outcomes related to the 
        long-term goals of increasing stability within the community 
        for individuals and families who have been chronically 
        homeless, and decreasing the recurrence of periods of 
        homelessness.
            ``(2) Performance outcomes.--The performance outcomes 
        described under paragraph (1) shall include, with respect to 
        individuals and families who have been chronically homeless--
                    ``(A) improvements in housing stability;

                    ``(A) identifies the grantee's progress toward

    ``(n) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
            ``(1) Chronically homeless.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `chronically homeless', 
                used with respect to an individual or family, means an 
                individual or family who--
                            ``(i) is homeless;
                            ``(ii) has been homeless continuously for

                        substance use disorder, a serious mental 
                        illness, a developmental disability (as defined 
                        in section 102 of the Developmental 
                        Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act 
                        of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)), post traumatic 
                        stress disorder, a cognitive impairment 
                        resulting from a brain injury, or a chronic 
                        physical illness or disability or the co-
                        occurrence of 2 or more chronic physical 
                        illnesses or disabilities.
                    ``(B) Rule of construction.--An individual shall be 
                considered to be chronically homeless if such 
                individual--
                            ``(i) resides in an institutional care 
                        facility, including a jail, substance use 
                        disorder or mental health treatment facility, 
                        hospital, or other similar facility;
                            ``(ii) has resided in a facility described 
                        in clause (i) for fewer than 90 days; and
                            ``(iii) met all of the requirements 
                        described in subparagraph (A) prior to entering 
                        that facility.
            ``(2) Homeless.--The term `homeless' means living or 
        residing in a place not meant for human habitation, in a safe 
        haven, or in an emergency homeless shelter.
            ``(3) Permanent supportive housing.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `permanent supportive 
                housing' means permanent, affordable housing with 
                flexible support services that are available and 
                designed to help the tenants stay housed and build the 
                necessary skills to live as independently as possible. 
                Such term does not include housing that is time-
                limited. Supportive housing offers residents assistance 
                in reaching their full potential, which may include 
                opportunities to secure other housing that meets their 
                needs and preferences, based on individual choice 
                instead of the requirements of time-limited 
                transitional programs. Under this section, permanent 
                affordable housing includes permanent housing funded or 
                assisted through title IV of the McKinney-Vento 
                Homeless Assistance Act and section 8 of the United 
                States Housing Act of 1937.
                    ``(B) Affordable.--For purposes of subparagraph 
                (A), the term `affordable' means within the financial 
                means of individuals who are extremely low income, as 
                defined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
                Development.
            ``(4) Substance use disorder services.--The term `substance 
        use disorder', used with respect to services, has the meaning 
        given the term `substance abuse services' in section 
        330(h)(5)(C).
    ``(o) Funding.--
            ``(1) Authorization of appropriations.--For the purpose of 
        carrying out this section, there are authorized to be 
        appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the 
        fiscal years 2016 through 2020.
            ``(2) Allocation for training and technical assistance.--Of 
        the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, 
        the Secretary may reserve not more than 3 percent for carrying 
        out subsection (l).''.
    (b) Technical Amendments to Public Health Service Act.--Title V of 
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa et seq.) is amended by--
            (1) redesignating part G, as added by section 144 of the 
        Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, as part J; and
            (2) redesignating sections 581 through 584, as added by 
        section 144 of such Act, as sections 596 through 596C, 
        respectively.
