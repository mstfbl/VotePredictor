    Section 1853(a)(1)(C) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO MEDICARE ADVANTAGE STAR RATING 
              SYSTEM.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has 
        inadvertently created a star rating system under section 
        1853(o)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-
        23(o)(4)) for Medicare Advantage plans that lacks proper 
        accounting for the socioeconomic status of enrollees in such 
        plans and the extent to which such plans serve individuals who 
        are also eligible for medical assistance under title XIX of 
        such Act; and
            (2) Congress will work with the Centers for Medicare & 
        Medicaid Services and stakeholders, including beneficiary 
        groups and managed care organizations, to ensure that such 
        rating system properly accounts for the socioeconomic status of 
        enrollees in such plans and the extent to which such plans 
        serve such individuals described in paragraph (1).

SEC. 4. DELAY IN AUTHORITY TO TERMINATE CONTRACTS FOR MEDICARE 
              ADVANTAGE PLANS FAILING TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM QUALITY 
              RATINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Consistent with the studies provided under the 
IMPACT Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-185), it is the intent of Congress--
            (1) to continue to study and request input on the effects 
        of socioeconomic status and dual-eligible populations on the 
        Medicare Advantage STARS rating system before reforming such 
        system; and
            (2) pending the results of such studies and input, to 
        provide for a temporary delay in authority of the Centers for 
        Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to terminate Medicare 
        Advantage plan contracts solely on the basis of performance of 
        plans under the STARS rating system.
    (b) Delay in MA Contract Termination Authority for Plans Failing To 
Achieve Minimum Quality Ratings.--Section 1857(h) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-27(h)) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) Delay in contract termination authority for plans 
        failing to achieve minimum quality rating.--The Secretary may 
        not terminate a contract under this section with respect to the 
        offering of an MA plan by a Medicare Advantage organization 
        solely because the MA plan has failed to achieve a minimum 
        quality rating under the 5-star rating system established under 
        section 1853(o) during the period beginning on the date of the 
        enactment of this paragraph and through the end of plan year 
        2018.''.
