                                 A BILL


 
   To establish a national program to identify landslide hazards and 
          reduce loss from landslides, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Landslide Loss Reduction 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While landslides can and do occur in every State and 
        territory of the United States, the type, including sink holes, 
        ground fissures, and subsidence, the severity, and frequency of 
        landslides vary from place to place, depending on the terrain, 
        geology, seismicity and climate.
            (2) Landslides in the United States cause an estimated 
        $3,000,000,000 in damage each year, and that estimation could 
        be improved through better tracking of landslide occurrences 
        and losses.
            (3) The most recent official estimate of deaths from 
        landslides in the United States was in 1985, and it found that 
        landslides kill an estimated 25 to 50 people each year.
            (4) On March 22, 2014, a massive landslide near Oso, 
        Washington, killed 43 people, engulfed 42 homes, and severely 
        damaged public infrastructure and private property.
            (5) There is no collective landslide inventory for most 
        counties, States, or the United States, nor is there an agreed-
        upon methodology for creating one, since the availability of 
        Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), a powerful tool for 
        creating landslide inventories, is uneven and the quality is 
        highly variable.
            (6) Because landslide hazard analysis continues to evolve, 
        developing analysis methods is an important element of 
        technical assistance for nongovernmental entities and State and 
        local governments.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL LANDSLIDE HAZARDS REDUCTION PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting through 
the Director of the United States Geological Survey, shall establish a
