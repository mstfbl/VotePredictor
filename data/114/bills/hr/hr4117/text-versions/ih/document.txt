To require statistics relating to community trust in law enforcement in 
      the National Crime Victim's Survey, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tracking Reputations Upgrades 
Societal Trust Act of 2015'' or the ``TRUST Act of 2015''.

SEC. 2. REQUIRED INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL CRIME VICTIM'S SURVEY OF 
              STATISTICS RELATING TO COMMUNITY TRUST IN LAW 
              ENFORCEMENT.

    Not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, as 
part of each National Crime Victim's Survey, the Attorney General shall 
include statistics relating to the level of trust by the residents of a 
State or unit of local government in each law enforcement agency that 
serves that jurisdiction.

SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

    Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
and annually thereafter, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress 
a report that includes recommendations of the Attorney General on 
actions that may be taken to improve the level of trust by residents of 
a State or unit of local government in law enforcement agencies serving 
that jurisdiction, if the results of the statistics required to be 
included in the National Crime Victim's Survey by section 2 of this Act 
indicate that such level of trust is, in the determination of the 
Attorney General, problematically low.
                                 <all>
