        credit.--No credit shall be allowed under this section by

        joint return, of the taxpayer's spouse, is an individual 
        taxpayer identification number (known as an ITIN) issued by the

        inserting ``, and'', and by inserting before the last sentence 
        the following:
                    ``(O) an entry on a return claiming the credit 
                under section 24 by reason of subsection (d) thereof if 
                such credit is disallowed by section 24(e)(2).''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--Subparagraph (I) of section 
        6213(g)(1) of such Code is amended by striking ``section
