            ``(14) Certain veterans hired in the field of renewable

                include only wages attributable to services rendered in 
                a field of renewable energy.
                    ``(B) Specified veteran.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `specified veteran' means any 
                veteran (as defined in paragraph (3)) who is certified 
                by the designated local agency as--
                            ``(i) having received a credential or 
                        certification from the Department of Defense of 
                        military occupational specialty or skill in a

                            ``(ii) having completed a vocational degree 
                        in a field of renewable energy during the 1-
                        year period ending on the hiring date, or

                periods of time and do not diminish, including the sun, 
                wind, moving water, organic plant and waste material, 
                and the earth's heat.''.
    (b) Treatment of Possessions.--
            (1) Payments to possessions.--
                    (A) Mirror code possessions.--The Secretary of the 
                Treasury shall pay to each possession of the United 
                States with a mirror code tax system amounts equal to 
                the loss to that possession by reason of the amendment 
                made by this section. Such amounts shall be determined 
                by the Secretary of the Treasury based on information 
                provided by the government of the respective possession 
                of the United States.
                    (B) Other possessions.--The Secretary of the 
                Treasury shall pay to each possession of the United 
                States which does not have a mirror code tax system the 
                amount estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury as 
                being equal to the loss to that possession that would 
                have occurred by reason of the amendment made by this 
                section if a mirror code tax system had been in effect 
                in such possession. The preceding sentence shall not 
                apply with respect to any possession of the United 
                States unless such possession establishes to the 
                satisfaction of the Secretary that the possession has 
                implemented (or, at the discretion of the Secretary, 
                will implement) an income tax benefit which is 
                substantially equivalent to the income tax credit in 
                effect after the amendments made by this section.
            (2) Coordination with credit allowed against united states 
        income taxes.--The credit allowed against United States income 
        taxes for any taxable year under the amendment made by this 
        section to section 51 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to 
        any person with respect to any qualified veteran shall be 
        reduced by the amount of any credit (or other tax benefit 
        described in paragraph (1)(B)) allowed to such person against 
        income taxes imposed by the possession of the United States by 
        reason of this subsection with respect to such qualified 
        veteran for such taxable year.
            (3) Definitions and special rules.--
                    (A) Possession of the united states.--For purposes 
                of this subsection, the term ``possession of the United 
                States'' includes American Samoa, Guam, the 
                Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the 
                Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the United States 
                Virgin Islands.
                    (B) Mirror code tax system.--For purposes of this 
                subsection, the term ``mirror code tax system'' means, 
                with respect to any possession of the United States, 
                the income tax system of such possession if the income 
                tax liability of the residents of such possession under 
                such system is determined by reference to the income 
                tax laws of the United States as if such possession 
                were the United States.
                    (C) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 
                1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, the 
                payments under this subsection shall be treated in the 
                same manner as a refund due from credit provisions 
                described in such section.
    (f) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to individuals who begin work for the employer after December 31, 2014.
