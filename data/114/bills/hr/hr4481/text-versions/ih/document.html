SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) No country has reached sustained economic growth 
        without achieving near universal primary education. Quality 
        education reduces poverty and inequality, lays the foundation 
        for sound governance, civic participation, strong institutions, 
        and equips people with the knowledge, skills, and self-reliance 
        they need to increase income and expand their opportunities for 
        employment.
            (2) Approximately 59,000,000 primary-school-aged children 
        and 65,000,000 adolescents are out of school. In sub-Saharan 
        Africa alone, the number of primary-age children out of school 
        has remained at approximately 30,000,000 over the past five 
        years. Half of the children in the world do not have access to 
        preschool and more than 200,000,000 children under five years 
        old are not reaching their full development potential due to 
        the absence of early childhood care and development.
            (3) Millions of children are not learning in school. Among 
        the world's 650,000,000 children of primary school age, an 
        estimated 250,000,000 children are not learning basic skills in 
        reading, writing, and math or are dropping out before the 
        fourth grade. In addition, an estimated 103,000,000 youth 
        cannot read or write.
            (4) Of the 120,000,000 to 150,000,000 children with 
        disabilities under the age of 18 around the world, an estimated 
        98 percent do not attend school.
            (5) Gender discrimination continues to be a barrier to 
        girls' education in many parts of the world, and on average, 
        girls in developing countries still receive significantly less 
        schooling than boys. Nearly two-thirds of the world's 
        751,000,000 illiterate adults are women. Global attacks on 
        girls at school have increased, including the 2012 attack on 
        education activist Malala Yousafzai by the Taliban in Pakistan 
        and the kidnapping of hundreds of Nigerian girls by the 
        terrorist organization Boko Haram in April 2014.
            (6) Roughly half, or 28,500,000, of the world's out-of-
        school children live in countries affected by conflict and 
        crisis. The proportion of children who are denied an education 
        in conflict affected countries has increased from 42 percent in 
        2008 to 50 percent in 2015.
            (7) In areas of conflict and fragility, education is often 
        under attack. Attacks on education include damage or 
        destruction of schools by arson, grenades, mines, and rockets, 
        threats to teachers and officials, looting, and the killing of 
        children and staff. In 2014, the Taliban ambushed a school in 
        Pakistan, killing 145 children and teachers. In Syria, 
        militants waged at least 68 separate attacks on schools, 
        killing over 160 children in 2014. The use of schools and 
        universities for military purposes by armed groups or armed 
        forces is one of the key factors that reduces enrollment and 
        lowers rates of transition to higher levels of education.
            (8) In 2011, the United States Agency for International 
        Development (USAID) announced the first 5-year strategy to 
        strengthen United States basic education programming, centered 
        around three goals--
                    (A) improved reading skills for 100,000,000 
                children in primary grades;
                    (B) improved ability of tertiary and workforce 
                development programs to generate workforce skills 
                relevant to a country's development goals; and
                    (C) increased equitable access to education in 
                crisis and conflict environments for 15,000,000 
                learners.
            (9) The United States partners with other major donors, 
        nongovernmental organizations, the private sector and 
        multilateral organizations, including the Global Partnership 
        for Education to help leverage success. The Global Partnership 
        for Education is the only multilateral partnership dedicated to 
        getting all children into school and learning, working with 
        developing country partners to develop and implement national 
        education plans.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to promote universal basic education in developing 
        countries;
            (2) an educated citizenry contributes to sustained economic 
        growth, strengthened democratic institutions, the empowerment 
        of women and girls, and decreased extremism; and
            (3) United States resources and leadership should be 
        utilized in a way to best ensure a successful international 
        effort to provide children in developing countries with a 
        quality basic education in order to achieve the goal of quality 
        universal basic education.

SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ACHIEVE QUALITY UNIVERSAL BASIC 
              EDUCATION.

    Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 105 the 
following new section:

``SEC. 105A. CLARIFICATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ACHIEVE QUALITY UNIVERSAL 
              BASIC EDUCATION.

    ``(a) Policy.--In carrying out section 105, it is the policy of the 
United States to work with other countries, multilateral organizations, 
international and local civil society organizations, and other major 
donors in order to achieve sustainable quality universal basic 
education in order to--
            ``(1) work with other countries, multilateral 
        organizations, international and local civil society 
        organizations, and other major donors in order to achieve 
        sustainable quality universal basic education;
            ``(2) assist developing countries in ensuring all children 
        have access to quality basic education, including through 
        strengthening developing countries' educational systems;
            ``(3) improve the quality of basic education, which may 
        include a focus on measurably improving learning outcomes and 
        foundational skills in such areas as literacy and numeracy, 
        critical thinking, and civic education, in order to increase 
        the number of children completing and benefiting from a basic 
        education;
            ``(4) seek to expand access to quality schools and 
        teachers, particularly for marginalized children and vulnerable 
        groups;
            ``(5) promote education as the foundation for communities' 
        development, leading to conflict and violence prevention and 
        mitigation, improved health and disease prevention and 
        treatment, greater gender parity, increased economic growth and 
        improved agricultural activities, early childhood development, 
        improved entrepreneurial and leadership opportunities, disaster 
        preparedness, democracy promotion, and holistic assistance 
        programs; and
            ``(6) monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and quality of 
        basic education programs.
    ``(b) Principles.--In developing the policy referred to in 
subsection (a), the United States shall be guided by the following 
principles of coordination, sustainability, and aid effectiveness:
            ``(1) United states resources.--United States resources 
        shall be used to effectively engage in a global commitment to 
        achieving quality universal basic education in developing 
        countries, including in countries affected by or emerging from 
        armed conflict or humanitarian crises.
            ``(2) Integrated bilateral and multilateral approach to 
        sustainable development.--United States assistance should 
        integrate bilateral and multilateral assistance modalities 
        within the strategy developed pursuant to section 5 of the 
        Education for All Act of 2016, to be directly responsive to 
        recipient country needs, capacity, and commitment, and lead to 
        sustainable development. The United States shall engage on a 
        multilateral basis in a manner that leverages overall impact 
        and best reinforces United States bilateral aid efforts, which 
        are central to United States efforts in basic education. 
        Bilateral and multilateral assistance should be undertaken in 
        close partnership with nongovernmental organizations and other 
        development partners, including women-led groups.
            ``(3) United states assistance to multilateral education 
        initiatives.--The United States should support multilateral 
        coordination and financing education initiatives, including the 
        Global Partnership for Education. United States assistance 
        should build upon its comparative advantages and proficiencies 
        in basic education programs, while leveraging the efforts of 
        existing country-level development partnerships. Multilateral 
        mechanisms should be aligned with globally established aid 
        effectiveness principles, in coordination with recipient 
        country priorities, and in a transparent manner that achieves 
        measurable results in access, quality, and learning.
            ``(4) Coordination and mobilization of resources.--United 
        States efforts should coordinate with other donors, the local 
        and international private sector, local governments, and civil 
        society, including organizations that represent teachers, 
        students, and parents, interested in supporting quality 
        universal basic education efforts. The United States should 
        seek to mobilize and leverage resources from such parties in 
        support of basic education.
            ``(5) Coordination within the united states government.--
        The United States Government, led by the United States Agency 
        for International Development, shall support improved 
        coordination and collaboration among all relevant executive 
        branch agencies and officials to efficiently and effectively 
        use resources, including efforts to provide a continuity of 
        assistance for basic education in humanitarian and other 
        emergency situations.
            ``(6) Coordination with national education plans and 
        economic development programs.--United States assistance for 
        basic education in developing countries shall be provided in 
        collaboration and coordination with, where possible, national 
        education plans that promote the value of education, and 
        increase community and family awareness of the positive impact 
        of education to reducing poverty and spurring sustained 
        economic growth. The United States should seek to encourage 
        developing countries to utilize schools as platforms for the 
        development of communities. Such assistance should support 
        programs and activities that are appropriate for and meet the 
        needs of the local and indigenous cultures and carry out 
        programs and activities through implementation by country-based 
        civil society organizations that support national education 
        plans.

SEC. 5. COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PROMOTE 
              UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION.

    (a) Strategy Required.--Not later than October 1, 2016, October 1, 
2021, and October 1, 2026, the President, acting through the 
Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development 
and in coordination with other relevant executive branch agencies and 
officials, shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
comprehensive integrated United States strategy to promote quality 
universal basic education by--
            (1) seeking to equitably expand access to basic education 
        for all children, particularly marginalized children and 
        vulnerable groups; and
            (2) improving the quality of basic education, particularly 
        as reflected in measurable learning outcomes, as appropriate.
    (b) Requirement To Consult.--In developing the strategy required by 
subsection (a), the President shall consult with--
            (1) the appropriate congressional committees;
            (2) relevant executive branch agencies and officials;
            (3) recipient country governments; and
            (4) local and international nongovernmental organizations, 
        including organizations representing students, teachers, and 
        parents, and other development partners and individuals who are 
        involved in the promotion and implementation of education 
        assistance programs in developing countries.
    (c) Public Comment.--The President shall provide an opportunity for 
public comment on the strategy required by subsection (a).
    (d) Initial Strategy.--For the purposes of this section, the 
strategy entitled ``USAID education strategy'', as in effect on the day 
before the date of the enactment of this Act, shall be deemed to 
fulfill the initial requirements of subsection (a).
    (e) Priority and Other Requirements.--In providing assistance under 
section 105 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the President shall 
give priority to foreign countries in which there is the greatest need 
and opportunity to expand universal access and to improve learning 
outcomes, and in which the assistance can produce a substantial, 
measurable impact on children and educational systems. Priority should 
also be considered in countries where there are chronically underserved 
and marginalized populations, or populations affected by conflict or 
crisis, which must be reached in order to achieve universal basic 
education.
    (f) Elements.--The strategy required by subsection (a) shall be 
formulated and implemented in consideration of the principles set forth 
in section 105A(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by 
section 4 of this Act) and shall seek to--
            (1) support and coordinate with national education plans 
        and work to build capacity within developing countries, 
        including governments and civil society organizations, on 
        public basic education systems;
            (2) identify and replicate successful interventions that 
        improve access to and quality of education;
            (3) include specific objectives, and indicators, including 
        indicators to measure learning outcomes, and approaches to 
        increase access and quality of basic education in developing 
        countries, and ensure such objectives have clear actionable 
        targets, goals, and metrics, including annual interim targets 
        in order to measure and show progress toward the overall goal 
        as well as consistent metrics across agencies, toward the goal 
        of all children in school and learning, as well as benchmarks 
        and timeframes;
            (4) project general levels of resources needed to achieve 
        the stated program objectives;
            (5) leverage United States capabilities, including through 
        technical assistance, training, and research;
            (6) improve coordination and reduce duplication among 
        relevant executive branch agencies and officials, foreign donor 
        governments, and international organizations at the global and 
        country levels;
            (7) target the activities of the United States to leverage 
        contributions from other bilateral donors to provide quality 
        universal basic education;
            (8) focus on the marginalized and hardest-to-reach children 
        who remain out of school, including those in conflict and 
        crisis situations;
            (9) outline how the United States Government will ensure a 
        transition and continuity of educational activities in 
        countries affected by or emerging from armed conflict or 
        humanitarian crises; and
            (10) adopt a ``communities of learning'' approach that 
        integrates, where appropriate and to the extent practicable, 
        school and educational programs with health and development 
        programs, nutrition and school feeding programs, sanitation and 
        hygiene education, adult literacy, leadership development, 
        prevention of school-related violence, entrepreneurial 
        training, agricultural extension work, civic education, and 
        housing programs.
    (g) Activities Supported.--Assistance provided under section 105 of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 should be prioritized based on the 
goals articulated in the strategy required by subsection (a) and may be 
used to support efforts to expand access to and improve the quality of 
basic education, including to--
            (1) ensure an adequate supply of trained, effective 
        teachers and to build systems to provide continuing support, 
        training, and professional development for all educators;

                levels; and
                    (C) promote the development and effective use of
