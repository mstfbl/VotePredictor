                improved basic education, as determined by indicators 
                such as literacy and numeracy rates;
                    (B) to build the capacity of relevant actors in 
                partner countries, including in government and in civil

                    (E) to develop means to track implementation in 
                partner countries and ensure that such countries are 
                expending appropriate domestic resources and 
                instituting any relevant legal, regulatory, or 
                institutional reforms needed to achieve stated program 
                objectives;
                    (F) to leverage United States capabilities, 
                including through technical assistance, training, and 
                research; and
                    (G) to improve coordination and reduce duplication 
                among relevant Executive branch agencies and officials, 
                other donors, multilateral institutions, 
                nongovernmental organizations, and governments in
