        principles of section 7701(b)(3)(A) (applied by substituting 
        `122 days' for `31 days' in clause (i) thereof) without regard 
        to sections 7701(b)(3)(B), (C), and (D)) during the taxable 
        year in Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands,

            ``(3) for purposes of paragraph (1), the principles of 
        section 864(c)(2), rather than rules similar to the rules in 
        section 864(c)(4), shall apply for purposes of determining 
        whether income from sources without a possession specified in 
        subsection (a)(1) is effectively connected with the conduct of 
        a trade or business within such possession, and
            ``(4) for purposes of paragraph (2), income from activities 
        within the United States which are of a preparatory or 
        auxiliary character shall not be treated as income from sources 
        within the United States or as effectively connected with the 
        conduct of a trade or business within the United States.''.
    (c) Source Rules for Personal Property Sales.--Section 865(j)(3) of
