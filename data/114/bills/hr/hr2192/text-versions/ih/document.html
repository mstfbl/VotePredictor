                complainant to the position that the complainant held 
                before the retaliation, together with compensatory

                terms, or conditions that would apply to the

                complainant for, or in connection with, bringing the 
                complaint regarding the retaliation, as determined by 
                the Secretary.
            ``(2) Exhaustion of remedies.--If the Secretary issues an 
        order denying relief under paragraph (1) or has not issued an 
        order within 210 days after the submission of a complaint under 
        subsection (b), or in the case of an extension of time under 
        subsection (b)(2)(B), not later than 30 days after the 
        expiration of the extension of time, and there is no showing 
        that such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant, the 
        complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted all 
        administrative remedies with respect to the complaint, and the 
        complainant may bring a de novo action at law or equity against 
        the institution to seek compensatory damages and other relief 
        available under this section in the appropriate district court 
        of the United States, which shall have jurisdiction over such 
        an action without regard to the amount in controversy. Such an 
        action shall, at the request of either party to the action, be 
        tried by the court with a jury. An action under this paragraph

        action at law or equity brought pursuant to this subsection.

        comply with an order issued under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
        shall file an action for enforcement of such order in the 
        United States district court for a district in which the 
        retaliation was found to have occurred. In any action brought 
        under this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, 
        including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary 
        damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. The person upon whose 
        behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join 
        in an action filed by the Secretary.
            ``(5) Judicial review.--Any person adversely affected or 
        aggrieved by an order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain 
        review of the order's conformance with this subsection, and any 
        regulations issued to carry out this section, in the United 
        States court of appeals for a circuit in which the retaliation 
        is alleged in the order to have occurred. No petition seeking 
        such review may be filed more than 60 days after issuance of 
        the order by the head of the executive agency. Such review 
        shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. 
        Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of 
        the order of the Secretary, unless a stay is specifically 
        entered by the court.
            ``(6) Burdens of proof.--The legal burdens of proof 
        specified in section 1221(e) of title 5, United States Code, 
        shall be controlling for the purposes of any investigation 
        conducted by the Inspector General, decision by the Secretary,

        discrimination prohibited under this section has occurred.

        remedies provided for in this section may not be waived by any 
        agreement, policy, form, or condition of employment.
    ``(d) Notification of Persons Associated With Institution.--The 
Secretary shall ensure that each institution informs the employees, 
students, and contractors of the institution in writing of the rights 
and remedies provided under this section.
    ``(e) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed to 
authorize the discharge of, demotion of, or discrimination against a

    Part G of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1088 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 489 the following 
new section:

``SEC. 489A. CIVIL PENALTIES AND OTHER REMEDIES.

    ``(a) Sanctions for Substantial Misrepresentations or Serious 
Violations.--
            ``(1) Civil penalties.--The Secretary may impose a civil 
        penalty upon an eligible institution upon making a 
        determination, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a 
        hearing, that an eligible institution has engaged in a 
        substantial misrepresentation or other serious violation.
            ``(2) Amount of civil penalties.--A civil penalty imposed 
        for a violation under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than 
        $100,000 or--
                    ``(A) in the case of a first violation, an amount 
                equal to the product of $1,000,000 multiplied by the 
                institution's student default risk, whichever is 
                larger;
                    ``(B) in the case of a second violation, an amount 
                equal to the product of $2,000,000 multiplied by the 
                institution's student default risk, whichever is 
                larger; and
                    ``(C) in the case of a third or subsequent 
                violation, an amount equal to the product of $3,000,000 
                multiplied by the institution's student default risk, 
                whichever is larger.
            ``(3) Treatment of multiple institutions.--For the purpose 
        of determining the number of violations for subparagraph (B), 
        any violation by a particular institution will accrue against 
        all identification codes used by the Office of Postsecondary 
        Education to designate campuses and institutions affiliated 
        with the institution, and within the period of participation 
        for the institution, as defined in section 668.13(b) of title 
        34, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.
    ``(b) Sanctions for Other Violations of This Title.--Upon 
determination, after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing, 
that an eligible institution has engaged in a violation of any other 
provision of this title, including the failure to carry out any 
provision of this title, that is not a significant misrepresentation or 
other serious violation, the Secretary may impose a civil penalty upon 
such institution of not more than $100,000 (subject to such adjustments 
for inflation as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation) for each 
such violation.
    ``(c) Civil Penalties and Sanctions for Officers of Institutions.--
Upon determination, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a 
hearing on the record, that an officer of an institution of higher 
education that participates in a program under this title has knowingly 
and willfully, or with gross negligence, violated a provision of this 
title, the Secretary may sanction the officer. Such sanctions may 
include the following:
            ``(1) Prohibiting the institution of higher education that 
        has employed the officer of an institution of higher education 
        and that participates in a program under this title, or any 
        other institution of higher education that participates in a 
        program under this title, from employing the officer, except 
        that any such prohibition under this subsection shall not be 
        for a period of more than 5 years from the date of the 
        determination of the violation.
            ``(2) Assessing a civil penalty against an officer of an 
        institution of higher education who has knowingly and 
        willfully, or with gross negligence, violated a provision of 
        this title, except that any such civil penalty under this 
        subsection shall not be greater than the amount of the 
        officer's compensation for each year for which the violations 
        are determined to have occurred. For purposes of this 
        subparagraph, an officer's compensation shall include proceeds 
        of any sales of stock and any incentive-based compensation 
        (including stock options awarded as compensation) based on 
        information required to be reported to the Secretary or any 
        other Federal agency during the period in which the violations 
        are determined to have occurred.
    ``(d) Limitation, Suspension, or Termination of Eligibility 
Status.--
            ``(1) In general.--Upon determination, after reasonable 
        notice and opportunity for a hearing, that an eligible 
        institution has engaged in a violation of any provision of this 
        title (including the failure to carry out any provision of this 
        title or any regulation prescribed under such provision) or a 
        violation of any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or 
        limitation, the Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the 
        participation in any program under this title of an eligible 
        institution, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Suspension procedures.--No period of suspension under 
        this section shall exceed 60 days unless the institution and 
        the Secretary agree to an extension or unless limitation or 
        termination proceedings are initiated by the Secretary within 
        that period of time.
    ``(e) Emergency Action.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may take an emergency 
        action against an institution, under which the Secretary shall, 
        effective on the date on which a notice and statement of the 
        basis of the action is mailed to the institution (by registered 
        mail, return receipt requested), withhold funds from the 
        institution or its students and withdraw the institution's 
        authority to obligate funds under any program under this title, 
        if the Secretary--
                    ``(A) receives information, determined by the 
                Secretary to be reliable, that the institution is 
                violating any provision of this title, any regulation 
                prescribed under this title, or any applicable special 
                arrangement, agreement, or limitation;
                    ``(B) determines that immediate action is necessary 
                to prevent misuse of Federal funds; and
                    ``(C) determines that the likelihood of loss 
                outweighs the importance of the procedures prescribed 
                in subsection (e) for limitation, suspension, or 
                termination.
            ``(2) Time limitation.--An emergency action described in 
        paragraph (1) shall not exceed 30 days unless limitation, 
        suspension, or termination proceedings are initiated by the 
        Secretary against the institution within that period of time.
            ``(3) Opportunity to show cause.--The Secretary shall 
        provide an institution that is the subject of an emergency 
        action under this subsection an opportunity to show cause, if 
        the institution so requests, that the emergency action is 
        unwarranted and should be lifted.
    ``(f) Lifting of Sanctions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this title, an institution of higher education that has been sanctioned 
by the Secretary under this section or any other provision of this 
title may not have such sanctions lifted until the Secretary has 
conducted a subsequent program review under section 498A and has found 
the institution to be in compliance with this title.
    ``(g) Single Course of Conduct; Compromise Authority and Collection 
of Penalty.--
            ``(1) Same course of conduct.--For purposes of this 
        section, acts and omissions relating to a single course of 
        conduct shall be treated as a single violation.
            ``(2) Compromise authority.--Any civil penalty under this 
        section may be compromised (but not eliminated) by the 
        Secretary. In determining the amount of such penalty, or the 
        amount agreed upon in compromise, the Secretary shall 
        consider--
                    ``(A) the appropriateness of the penalty to the 
                size of the institution of higher education subject to 
                the determination; and
                    ``(B) the gravity of the violation, failure, or 
                misrepresentation.
    ``(h) Collection of Penalty.--The amount of any penalty under this 
section may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the 
institution charged.
    ``(i) Disposition of Amounts Recovered.--
            ``(1) In general.--Amounts collected under this section 
        shall be transferred to the Secretary, who shall determine the 
        distribution of collected amounts, in accordance with
