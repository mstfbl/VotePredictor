                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the use of Federal funds to accept commercial flight plans 
   for travel between the United States and Cuba until certain known 
  fugitives are returned to the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Before Commerce Act of 
2016''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR COMMERCIAL FLIGHT PLANS 
              FOR TRAVEL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CUBA.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1971, Charles Hill, along with Ralph Lawrence and 
        Albert Finney, hijacked an airplane leaving Albuquerque, New 
        Mexico, and carrying 150 passengers, in order to flee from 
        prosecution after allegedly murdering New Mexico State Police 
        officer Robert Rosenbloom.
            (2) Although both Lawrence and Finney have since died, Hill 
        is known to be alive and residing in Cuba, after being granted 
        asylum protections by Cuba.
            (3) Cuba harbors more than 70 known fugitives from justice 
        from the United States, preventing their prosecution in United 
        States courts.
            (4) The President of the United States has recently 
        expanded diplomatic relations with Cuba without regard to the 
        fugitives from justice from the United States who reside safely 
        within that communist country's borders.
            (5) The United States and Cuba have bilateral extradition 
        treaties, established in 1905 and 1926 (33 Stat. 2265, 33 Stat. 
        2273, and 44 Stat. 2392, respectively).
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
expect the Cuban government to extradite to the United States all known 
fugitives from justice from the United States.
    (c) Prohibition.--No Federal funds may be used to accept commercial 
flight plans for travel between the United States and Cuba before the 
date on which Cuba extradites to the United States the last known 
fugitive from justice from the United States who is located in Cuba.
