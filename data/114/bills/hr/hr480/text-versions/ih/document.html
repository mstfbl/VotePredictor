                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for 
 employer-provided employee housing assistance, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Housing America's Workforce Act of 
2015''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Resurgent housing markets are pricing out low- and 
        moderate-income families and are producing few lower-cost 
        units.
            (2) In many markets, housing costs have far outgrown the 
        rate of inflation and the gap between wages and housing costs 
        is widening, pushing affordable housing beyond the reach of an 
        increasing number of working families.
            (3) Despite some of the lowest mortgage rates in our 
        Nation's history, millions of working families still find it 
        extremely difficult to rent or purchase a home. Many workers 
        who fill jobs that provide the backbone of our communities--
        teachers, firefighters, and police officers--often cannot 
        afford to live in the communities in which they serve.
            (4) The United States Department of Housing and Urban 
        Development (HUD) considers housing affordable when a family 
        spends no more than 30 percent of its monthly income on rent 
        and utilities. Entry-level wage earners with annual incomes of 
        up to $30,000 spending no more than 30 percent of their income 
        on rent can only afford to pay up to $750 for rent. In the high 
        job-growth areas, such rents are not readily available.
            (5) Affordable housing is the key to creating and 
        sustaining healthy, economically vibrant communities.
            (6) The lack of affordable housing across the United States 
        has been shown to cause or contribute to labor shortages.
            (7) Under employer-assisted housing (EAH) programs 
        employers provide much needed housing assistance to their 
        employees.
            (8) EAH programs are innovative local solutions that have 
        increased affordable housing opportunities for thousands of 
        working families across America while benefitting the economy.
            (9) According to findings of the Rutgers University 
        American Affordable Housing Institute, employer-assisted 
        housing increases productivity by reducing commuting time as 
        well as saves money on recruitment and retention.
            (10) The future growth of EAH programs will remain 
        dependent upon increasing individual employer knowledge and 
        implementation of these programs.
            (11) EAH programs will not solve the Nation's housing 
        problems but such programs do seek to address the challenge 
        from a new perspective and allow the private sector to play a 
        direct role in promoting housing affordability. Additionally, 
        EAH programs can help to promote redevelopment and reinvestment 
        in distressed communities.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To expand affordable housing opportunities to low- and 
        moderate-income working individuals and families.
            (2) To encourage employers, counties, and municipalities to 
        invest in employer-assisted housing programs.
