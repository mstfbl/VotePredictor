        separate rule, grant an exemption from a requirement of a 
        subsection (a) rule for a specific condition of use of a

                or essential use for which no technically and 
                economically feasible safer alternative is available,

                security, or critical infrastructure; or

        exemption under this subsection, the Administrator shall 
        analyze the need for the exemption, and shall make public the 
        analysis and a statement describing how the analysis was taken 
        into account.

        establish, as part of a rule under this subsection, a time 
        limit on any exemption for a time to be determined by the 
        Administrator as reasonable on a case-by-case basis, and, by 
        rule, may extend, modify, or eliminate an exemption if the 
        Administrator determines, on the basis of reasonably available 
        information and after adequate public justification, the 
        exemption warrants extension or modification or is no longer 
        necessary.

        that may contribute to the creation of potential cancer 
        clusters; and
            (3) to enable Federal agencies to coordinate with other 
        Federal, State, and local agencies, institutes of higher 
        education, and the public in investigating and addressing 
        cancer clusters.
    (b) Designation and Investigation of Potential Cancer Clusters.--
Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280g et 
seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 399V-6. DESIGNATION AND INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIAL CANCER 
              CLUSTERS.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Cancer cluster.--The term `cancer cluster' means the 
        incidence of a particular cancer within a population group, a 
        geographical area, and a period of time that is greater than 
        expected for such group, area, and period.
            ``(2) Particular cancer.--The term `particular cancer' 
        means one specific type of cancer or a type of cancers 
        scientifically proven to have the same cause.
            ``(3) Population group.--The term `population group' means 
        a group, for purposes of calculating cancer rates, defined by 
        factors such as race, ethnicity, age, or gender.
    ``(b) Criteria for Designation of Potential Cancer Clusters.--
            ``(1) Development of criteria.--The Secretary shall develop 
        criteria for the designation of potential cancer clusters.
            ``(2) Requirements.--The criteria developed under paragraph 
        (1) shall consider, as appropriate--
                    ``(A) a standard for cancer cluster identification 
                and reporting protocols used to determine when cancer 
                incidence is greater than would be typically observed;
                    ``(B) scientific screening standards that ensure 
                that a cluster of a particular cancer involves the same 
                type of cancer, or types of cancers;
                    ``(C) the population in which the cluster of a 
                particular cancer occurs by factors such as race, 
                ethnicity, age, and gender, for purposes of calculating 
                cancer rates;
                    ``(D) the boundaries of a geographic area in which 
                a cluster of a particular cancer occurs so as not to 
                create or obscure a potential cluster by selection of a 
                specific area; and
                    ``(E) the time period over which the number of 
                cases of a particular cancer, or the calculation of an 
                expected number of cases, occurs.
    ``(c) Guidelines for Investigation of Potential Cancer Clusters.--
The Secretary, in consultation with the Council of State and 
Territorial Epidemiologists and representatives of State and local 
health departments, shall develop, publish, and periodically update 
guidelines for investigating potential cancer clusters. The guidelines 
shall--
            ``(1) recommend that investigations of cancer clusters--
                    ``(A) use the criteria developed under subsection 
                (b);
                    ``(B) use the best available science; and
                    ``(C) rely on a weight of the scientific evidence;
            ``(2) provide standardized methods of reviewing and 
        categorizing data, including from health surveillance systems 
        and reports of potential cancer clusters; and
            ``(3) provide guidance for using appropriate 
        epidemiological and other approaches for investigations.
    ``(d) Investigation of Cancer Clusters.--
            ``(1) Secretary discretion.--The Secretary--
                    ``(A) in consultation with representatives of the 
                relevant State and local health departments, shall 
                consider whether it is appropriate to conduct an 
                investigation of a potential cancer cluster; and
                    ``(B) in conducting investigations shall have the 
                discretion to prioritize certain potential cancer 
                clusters, based on the availability of resources.
            ``(2) Coordination.--In investigating potential cancer 
        clusters, the Secretary shall coordinate with agencies within 
        the Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal 
        agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency.
            ``(3) Biomonitoring.--In investigating potential cancer 
        clusters, the Secretary shall rely on all appropriate 
        biomonitoring information collected under other Federal 
        programs, such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
        Survey. The Secretary may provide technical assistance for 
        relevant biomonitoring studies of other Federal agencies.
    ``(e) Duties.--The Secretary shall--
            ``(1) ensure that appropriate staff of agencies within the 
        Department of Health and Human Services are prepared to provide 
        timely assistance, to the extent practicable, upon receiving a 
        request to investigate a potential cancer cluster from a State 
        or local health authority;
            ``(2) maintain staff expertise in epidemiology, toxicology, 
        data analysis, environmental health and cancer surveillance, 
        exposure assessment, pediatric health, pollution control, 
        community outreach, health education, laboratory sampling and 
        analysis, spatial mapping, and informatics;
            ``(3) consult with community members as investigations into 
        potential cancer clusters are conducted, as the Secretary 
        determines appropriate;
            ``(4) collect, store, and disseminate reports on 
        investigations of potential cancer clusters, the possible 
        causes of such clusters, and the actions taken to address such 
        clusters; and
            ``(5) provide technical assistance for investigating cancer 
        clusters to State and local health departments through existing 
        programs, such as the Epi-Aids program of the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention and the Assessments of Chemical 
        Exposures Program of the Agency for Toxic Substances and 
        Disease Registry.''.
