        not a chemical substance presents or will present, in the 
        absence of requirements under subsection (a), an unreasonable 
        risk of injury to health or the environment.
            ``(2) Applying requirements.--The Administrator shall apply 
        requirements with respect to a chemical substance through a 
        rule under subsection (a) only if the Administrator determines 
        through a risk evaluation under this subsection, without 
        consideration of costs or other non-risk factors, that the

        under section 6(b) that a chemical substance will not present 
        an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment 
        under the intended condition of use, no State or political 
        subdivision may, after the date of publication of such 
        determination, establish or continue in effect any requirement 
        that applies to such chemical substance under the intended 
        conditions of use considered by the Administrator in the risk 
        evaluation under section 6(b), and is designed to protect 
        against exposure to such chemical substance under the intended 
        conditions of use, unless the requirement of the State or 
        political subdivision--
                    ``(i) is adopted under the authority of a Federal

        injury to health or the environment associated with such 
        chemical substance or mixture, no State or political 
        subdivision may, after the effective date of such requirement, 
        establish or continue in effect any requirement that applies to 
        such chemical substance or mixture (including a requirement 
        that applies to an article because the article contains the 
        chemical substance or mixture) and is designed to protect 
        against exposure to the chemical substance or mixture either 
        under the intended conditions of use considered by the 
        Administrator in the risk evaluation under section 6(b) or from 
        a use identified in a notice received by the Administrator 
        under section 5(a), or, in the case of a requirement imposed 
        pursuant to section 6(i), is designed to protect against a risk 
        of injury considered by the Administrator in imposing such 
        requirement, unless the requirement of the State or political 
        subdivision--
                    ``(i) is identical to the requirement imposed by

                or determination made by the Administrator under this 
                title, actually conflicts with the requirement.''; and

paragraph (2)(C)(i)--
            ``(A) a State may not assess a penalty for a specific 
        violation for which the Administrator has assessed a penalty 
        under section 16; and
