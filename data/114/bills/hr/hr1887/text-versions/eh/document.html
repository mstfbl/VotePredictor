                                 AN ACT


 
 To authorize the Comptroller General of the United States to assess a 
  study on the alternatives for the disposition of Plum Island Animal 
                Disease Center, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Government has owned Plum Island, New York, 
        since 1899.
            (2) Since 1954, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center has 
        conducted unrivaled scientific research on a variety of 
        infectious animal-borne diseases, including foot-and-mouth 
        disease, resulting, most recently, in the development of a new 
        cell line that rapidly and reliably detects this highly 
        debilitating disease of livestock.
            (3) Over 62 years, the Center has had a strong, proven 
        record of safety.
            (4) $23,200,000 in Federal dollars have been spent on 
        upgrades to, and the maintenance of, the Center since January 
        2012.
            (5) In addition to the Center, Plum Island contains 
        cultural, historical, ecological, and natural resources of 
        regional and national significance.
            (6) Plum Island is situated where the Long Island Sound and 
        Peconic Bay meet, both of which are estuaries that are part of 
        the National Estuary Program and are environmentally and 
        economically significant to the region.
            (7) The Federal Government has invested hundreds of 
        millions of Federal dollars over the last two decades to make 
        long-term improvements with respect to the conservation and 
        management needs of Long Island Sound and Peconic Bay.
            (8) The Department of Homeland Security has undertaken a 
        study to consider alternatives for the final disposition of 
        Plum Island, including an analysis of--
                    (A) conservation of the island's resources;
                    (B) any remediation responsibilities;
                    (C) the need for any legislative changes;
                    (D) cost; and
                    (E) any revenues from the alternatives.

SEC. 2. REPORT REQUIRED ON STUDY BY DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ON 
              CLEAN UP AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF PLUM ISLAND.

    (a) Assessment by Comptroller General.--
            (1) Assessment required.--The Comptroller General of the 
        United States shall conduct an assessment of the study by the 
        Department of Homeland Security on the options for the 
        disposition of Plum Island referred to in section 1(8). Such 
        assessment shall include a determination of whether the 
        methodologies used by the Department in conducting such study 
        adequately support the Department's findings with respect to 
        the following:
                    (A) The possible alternative uses for Plum Island, 
                including the transfer of ownership to another Federal 
                agency, a State or local government, a nonprofit 
                organization, or a combination thereof for the purpose 
                of education, research, or conservation.
                    (B) The possible issues and implications, if any, 
                of pursuing such alternative uses for Plum Island.
                    (C) The potential cost to be incurred for expenses 
                related to the transition, cleanup, and hazard 
                mitigation of Plum Island by a recipient of such 
                property.
            (2) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        date on which the Department of Homeland Security completes the 
        study referred to in section 1(8), the Comptroller General of 
        the United States shall submit to Congress a report containing 
        the following:
                    (A) The results of the assessment described under 
                paragraph (1).
                    (B) A description of the Secretary of Homeland 
                Security's coordination with the Administrator of 
                General Services, the Secretary of the Interior, and 
                the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
                Agency in conducting the Department of Homeland 
                Security study referred to in section 1(8).
    (b) Study by Comptroller General.--
            (1) Study required.--If the Comptroller General of the 
        United States determines that the methodologies referred to in 
        subsection (a)(1) do not adequately support the Department of 
        Homeland Security's findings related to an issue described in 
        subparagraphs (A) through (C) of such subsection, the 
        Comptroller General shall conduct a study on any such issue.
            (2) Report required.--If the Comptroller General of the 
        United States conducts a study under paragraph (1), not later 
        than 1 year after the date on which the Department of Homeland 
        Security completes the study referred to in section 1(8), the 
        Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report 
        containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph 
        (1).

SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF ACTION.

    No action may be taken to carry out section 538 of title V of 
division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 
112-74; 125 Stat. 976) until at least 180 days after the reports 
required by subsection (a)(2) of section 2 and, if applicable,

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
