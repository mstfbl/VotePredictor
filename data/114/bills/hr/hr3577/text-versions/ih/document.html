Request.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), at the request of any person 
to whom the Director of the Government Publishing Office would have 
been required to provide a printed copy of a document under this 
chapter had subsection (a) not been in effect, the Director may print 
and distribute a copy of a document or report for the use of that 
person, except that--
            ``(1) the number of printed copies the Director may provide 
        to the person may not exceed the number of printed copies the 
        Director would have provided to the person had subsection (a) 
        not been in effect; and
            ``(2) the Director may print and distribute copies to the 
        person only upon payment by the person of the costs of printing 
        and distributing the copies, except that this paragraph shall

    (b) Provision of Documents in Electronic Format Deemed To Meet 
Requirements of House and Senate Rules Regarding Distribution of 
Printed Copies.--
            (1) In general.--If any rule or regulation of the House of 
        Representatives or Senate requires a Member or committee to 
        provide printed copies of any document (including any bill or 
        resolution) for the use of the House or Senate or for the use 
        of any office of the House or Senate, the Member or committee 
        shall be considered to have met the requirement of the rule or 
        regulation if the Member or committee makes the document 
        available to the recipient in an electronic format.
            (2) Exercise of rulemaking authority of senate and house.--
        This subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, and it supersedes other rules only to the 
                extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
                case of any other rule of that House.
    (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made by this 
section shall apply with respect to documents produced after the 
expiration of the 30-day period which begins on the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
