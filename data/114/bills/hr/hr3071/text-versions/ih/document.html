                                 A BILL


 
To permit employees to request changes to their work schedules without 
    fear of retaliation and to ensure that employers consider these 
  requests, and to require employers to provide more predictable and 
stable schedules for employees in certain occupations with evidence of 
unpredictable and unstable scheduling practices that negatively affect 
                   employees, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Schedules That 
Work Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The vast majority of the United States workforce today 
        is juggling responsibilities at home and at work. Women are 
        primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in 63 percent of 
        families in the United States.
            (2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today's workforce, 
        both hourly and salaried workers often have little ability to 
        make changes to their work schedules when those changes are 
        needed to accommodate family responsibilities.
            (3)(A) Low-wage working mothers are more likely to be 
        raising children on their own than higher-wage working mothers. 
        For example, more than half of mothers in low-wage jobs who 
        have very young children are single parents, compared to less 
        than one-third of all working mothers who have very young 
        children.
            (B) At the same time, low-wage workers have the least 
        control over their work schedules and the most unpredictable 
        schedules. For example--
                    (i) roughly half of low-wage workers reported very 
                little or no control over the timing of the hours they 
                were scheduled to work;
                    (ii)(I) many workers in low-wage jobs receive their 
                work schedules with very little advance notice; and
                    (II) 41 percent of workers who are ages 26 through 
                32 (referred to in this section as ``early career 
                workers'') in hourly jobs report getting their work 
                schedules a week or less in advance;
                    (iii) some workers in low-wage jobs are sent home 
                from work when work is slow without being paid for 
                their scheduled shift;
                    (iv)(I) many employers have adopted ``just-in-
                time'' scheduling, which bases workers' schedules on 
                perceived consumer demand and often results in workers 
                being given very little advance notice of their work 
                schedules; and
                    (II) in some industries, the use of ``call-in 
                shift'' requirements--requirements that workers call in 
                to work to find out whether they will be scheduled to 
                work later that day--have become common practice; and
                    (v)(I) 20 to 30 percent of workers in low-wage jobs 
                struggle with being required to work extra hours with 
                little or no notice; and
                    (II) in a typical month, for the 74 percent of 
                early-career workers in hourly jobs who report 
                fluctuations in their work hours, those hours typically 
                fluctuate by more than an 8-hour day of work and pay 
                per week.
            (4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it difficult for 
        low-wage workers to--
                    (A) provide necessary care for children and other 
                family members, including securing and maintaining 
                stable child care;
                    (B) access and receive needed care for the workers' 
                own serious health conditions;
                    (C) pursue workforce training;
                    (D) get or keep a second job, which many part-time 
                workers need to make ends meet;
                    (E) plan for and access transportation to reach 
                worksites; and
                    (F) qualify for and maintain eligibility for needed 
                public benefits and work supports, such as child care 
                subsidies and benefits under the supplemental nutrition 
                assistance program, due to fluctuations in income and 
                work hours.
            (5) Twenty-six percent of workers on irregular or on-call 
        schedules and 19 percent of workers on rotating or split shift 
        schedules experience work-family conflict, as compared to 11 
        percent of workers on regular work schedules.
            (6) Unpredictable and unstable schedules are common in a 
        wide range of occupations, including food preparation and 
        service, retail sales, and cleaning occupations. According to 
        data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for early-career 
        adults, 64 percent of food service workers, 50 percent of 
        retail workers, and 40 percent of cleaning workers know their 
        schedules only a week or less in advance. The average variation 
        between the least and most hours worked in a single month is 70 
        percent for food service workers, 50 percent for retail 
        workers, and 40 percent for cleaning workers.
            (7) Food service workers, retail workers, and cleaning 
        workers are among the lowest-paid workers. The median pay for 
        workers in those 3 occupations is between $9.20 and $10.57 per 
        hour, and women make up more than half of the workers in those 
        occupations. Workers in those occupations account for nearly 18 
        percent of workers in the economy, which is more than 
        24,000,000 workers.
            (8) Employers that have implemented fair work scheduling 
        policies that allow workers to have more control over their 
        work schedules, and provide more predictable and stable 
        schedules, have experienced significant benefits, including 
        reductions in absenteeism and workforce turnover, and increased 
        worker morale and engagement.
            (9) This Act is a first step in responding to the needs of 
        workers for a voice in the timing of their work hours and for 
        more predictable schedules.

    (a) Reporting Time Pay Requirement.--An employer shall pay a 
retail, food service, or cleaning employee or a designated employee, in 
an additional occupation designated by the Secretary, under section 
8(a)(2) as appropriate for coverage under this Act (referred to in this 
Act as ``a retail, food service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated 
employee'')--
            (1) for at least 4 hours at the regular rate of pay of the 
        employee involved for each day on which the retail, food 
        service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee reports 
        for work, as required by the employer, but is given less than 
        four hours of work, except that if the employee's scheduled 
        hours for a day are less than 4 hours, such employee shall be 
        paid for the scheduled hours of the employee involved for that 
        day if given less than the scheduled hours of work; and
            (2) for at least 1 hour at the regular rate of pay of the 
        employee involved for each day the retail, food service, 
        cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee is given specific 
        instructions to contact the employer of the employee involved, 
        or wait to be contacted by the employer, less than 24 hours in 
        advance of the start of a potential work shift to determine 
        whether the employee must report to work for such shift.
    (b) Split Shift Pay Requirement.--An employer shall pay a retail, 
food service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee for one 
additional hour at the employee's regular rate of pay for each day 
during which the employee works a split shift.

            (1) Initial schedule.--On or before a new retail, food 
        service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee's first 
        day of work, the employer shall inform the employee in writing 
        of the work schedule of the employee involved and the minimum 
        number of expected work hours the employee will be assigned to 
        work per month.
            (2) Providing notice of new schedules.--Except as provided 
        in paragraph (3), if a retail, food service, cleaning, or 
        Secretary's designated employee's work schedule changes from 
        the work schedule of which the employee was informed pursuant 
        to paragraph (1), the employer shall provide the employee with 
        the new work schedule of the employee involved not less than 14 
        days before the first day of the new work schedule. If the 
        expected minimum number of work hours that a retail, food 
        service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee will be 
        assigned changes from the number of which the employee involved 
        was informed pursuant to paragraph (1), the employer shall also 
        provide notification of that change, not less than 14 days in 
        advance of the first day this change will go into effect. 
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit an 
        employer from providing greater advance notice of a retail, 
        food service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee's 
        work schedule than is required under this section.
            (3) Work schedule changes made with less than 24 hours' 
        notice.--An employer may make work schedule changes as needed, 
        including by offering additional hours of work to retail, food 
        service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated employees beyond 
        those previously scheduled, but an employer shall be required 
        to provide one extra hour of pay at the employee's regular rate 
        for each shift that is changed with less than 24 hours' notice, 
        except in the case of the need to schedule the employee due to 
        the unforeseen unavailability of a retail, food service, 
        cleaning, or Secretary's designated employee previously 
        scheduled to work that shift.
            (4) Notifications in writing.--The notifications required 
        under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made to the employee 
        involved in writing. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed as prohibiting an employer from using any additional 
        means of notifying a retail, food service, cleaning, or 
        Secretary's designated employee of the work schedule of the 
        employee involved.
            (5) Schedule posting requirement.--Every employer employing 
        any retail, food service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated 
        employee, subject to this Act shall post the schedule and keep 
        it posted in a conspicuous place in every establishment where 
        such employee is employed so as to permit the employee involved 
        to observe readily a copy. Availability of that schedule by 
        electronic means accessible by all retail, food service, 
        cleaning, or Secretary's designated employees, of that employer 
        shall be considered compliance with this subsection.
            (6) Employee shift trading.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to prevent an employer from allowing a 
        retail, food service, cleaning, or Secretary's designated 
        employee to work in place of another employee who has been 
        scheduled to work a particular shift as long as the change in 
        schedule is mutually agreed upon by the employees. An employer 
        shall not be subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) or 
        (3) for such voluntary shift trades.
    (d) Pay Stub Transparency.--Any pay provided to an employee 
pursuant to subsection (a), (b), or (c)(3) (referred to in this 
paragraph as ``additional pay'') shall be included in the employee's 
regular paycheck. The employer shall identify, in the corresponding 
written wage statement or pay stub, the total number of hours of 
additional pay provided for the pay period involved and whether the 
additional pay was due to the requirements of subsection (a)(1), the 
requirements of subsection (a)(2), the requirements of subsection (b), 
or the requirements of subsection (c)(3).
    (e) Exception.--The requirements in subsections (a) through (d)
