                determined to be unemployable by the Secretary of 
                Veterans Affairs or has been assigned a disability

                equaling 100 percent) by the Secretary of Veterans 
                Affairs or the Secretary of Defense for a service-
                connected disability (as defined in section 101 of 
                title 38, United States Code), regardless of whether 
                such borrower provides documentation of such rating to 
                the Secretary of Education, shall be considered 
                permanently and totally disabled for the purpose of 
                discharging such borrower's loans under this 
                subsection, and such borrower shall not be required to 
                present any additional documentation for purposes of 
                this subsection.
                    ``(B) Rating of disability.--A determination of

                before, on, or after the date of enactment of this 
                paragraph, shall be automatically transmitted from the

                Affairs, as the case may be, to the Department of 
                Education and shall satisfy the documentation 
                requirement described in this subparagraph. The

                Education shall notify each borrower whose liability on 
                a loan has been discharged under this subsection that
