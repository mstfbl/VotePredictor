         TITLE XXVI--COUNTERTERRORISM SCREENING AND ASSISTANCE

SEC. 2601. FOREIGN PARTNER ENGAGEMENT PLAN.

    (a) Findings.--Consistent with the final report of the Committee on 
Homeland Security of the House of Representatives bipartisan ``Task 
Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel'', Congress 
makes the following findings:
            (1) It is important for the national security of the United 
        States to assist foreign partners in closing security gaps 
        which may allow terrorists and foreign fighters to travel 
        internationally, avoiding detection.
            (2) Building foreign partner capacity to combat terrorist 
        travel helps extend the United States security beyond its 
        border to mitigate threats before they reach the United States.
            (3) United States Government departments and agencies have 
        spent billions of dollars to help foreign partners improve 
        their security against terrorist travel since the attacks of 
        September 11, 2001, including through the provision of 
        technical assistance, equipment, training, and other tools.
            (4) The lack of a United States Governmentwide, risk-based 
        approach increases the odds that systematic security gaps 
        abroad may persist and that United States response efforts will 
        not be maximized in order to close these gaps.
            (5) Failure to effectively coordinate capacity-building 
        activities also results in greater risk of overlap, waste, and 
        unnecessary duplication between the United States and 
        international programs.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States Government must ensure capacity-building assistance is 
coordinated both among United States Government departments and 
agencies as well as with foreign implementing partners, and assistance 
should be prioritized for the highest-risk countries for travel by 
terrorists and foreign fighters.
    (c) Plan.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act and every 2 years thereafter at the 
        time of the President's budget submission to Congress under 
        section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, until 2022, the 
        Secretary of State shall, in accordance with the protection of 
        intelligence sources and methods, develop and submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees unclassified and 
        classified versions of a foreign partner engagement plan which 
        catalogues existing capacity-building initiatives abroad to 
        combat travel by terrorists and foreign fighters and identifies 
        areas for adjustment to align ongoing efforts with risk-based 
        priorities.
            (2) Coordination.--The plan required under paragraph (1) 
        shall be developed in coordination with all relevant United 
        States Government departments and agencies and in consultation 
        with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the 
        Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation.

        shall--
                    (A) include an assessment of all countries and 
                whether each country is high-risk, medium-risk, or low-
                risk for travel by terrorists and foreign fighters 
                based on the minimum standards described in section 
                2603(b), as well as--
                            (i) an identification of the number of 
                        flights that originate from last points of 
                        departure in each country to the United States;
                            (ii) visa waiver program status or visa 
                        application and denial rates for each country;
                            (iii) recent threats, terrorist and foreign 
                        fighter travel trends, and the overall terror 
                        threat environment in each country; and
                            (iv) other criteria as determined by the 
                        Secretary of State and the Secretary of

                    (B) detail existing United States Government 
                programs, projects, and activities which are intended 
                to or have the substantial effect of building the 
                capacity of such countries to combat travel by 
                terrorists and foreign fighters, including estimated 
                spending levels by country where practicable; and
                    (C) outline a plan for prioritizing United States 
                Government resources toward high-risk and medium-risk 
                countries, including--
                            (i) identifying efforts which should be 
                        reformed, consolidated, or eliminated; and
                            (ii) detailing new programs, projects, or 
                        activities that are requested, being planned, 
                        or are undergoing implementation and associated 
                        costs.

                biographic and biometric identification information via 
                kiosks, mobile devices, or other mobile enrollment 
                platforms to reduce the number of instances in which 
                passengers need to travel to enrollment centers;
                    (C) ensure that the kiosks, mobile devices, or 
                other mobile enrollment platforms referred to in 
                subparagraph (E) are secure and not vulnerable to data 
                breaches;
                    (D) ensure that any biometric and biographic 
                information is collected in a manner which is 
                comparable with the National Institute of Standards and 
                Technology standards and ensures privacy and data 
                security protections, including that applicants' 
                personally identifiable information is collected, 
                retained, used, and shared in a manner consistent with 
                section 552a of title 5, United States Code (commonly 
                known as the ``Privacy Act of 1974''), and agency 
                regulations;
                    (E) ensure that an individual who wants to enroll 
                in the PreCheck program and has started an application 
                with a single identification verification at one 
                location will be able to save such individual's 
                application on any kiosk, personal computer, mobile 
                device, or other mobile enrollment platform and be able 
                to return within a reasonable time to submit a second 
                identification verification; and
                    (F) ensure that any enrollment expansion using a 
                private sector risk assessment instead of a 
                fingerprint-based criminal history records check is 
                determined, by the Secretary of Homeland Security, to 
                be equivalent to a fingerprint-based criminal history 
                records check conducted through the Federal Bureau of 
                Investigation.
            (3) Marketing of precheck program.--Upon publication of 
        PreCheck program application enrollment standards pursuant to 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall--

                implement--
                            (i) a process, including an associated 
                        timeframe, for approving private sector 
                        marketing of the TSA PreCheck program; and
                            (ii) a strategy for partnering with the 
                        private sector to encourage enrollment in such 
                        program; and
                    (B) submit to Congress a report on any PreCheck 
                fees collected in excess of the costs of administering 
                such program, including recommendations for using such 
                amounts to support marketing of such program under this 
                subsection.
            (4) Identity verification enhancement.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Administrator shall--
                    (A) coordinate with the heads of appropriate 
                components of the Department to leverage Department-
                held data and technologies to verify the citizenship of 
                individuals enrolling in the TSA PreCheck program; and
                    (B) partner with the private sector to use advanced 
                biometrics and standards comparable with National 
                Institute of Standards and Technology standards to 
                facilitate enrollment in such program.
            (5) Precheck lane operation.--The Administrator shall--
                    (A) ensure that TSA PreCheck screening lanes are 
                open and available during peak and high-volume travel 
                times at airports to individuals enrolled in the 
                PreCheck program; and
                    (B) make every practicable effort to provide 
                expedited screening at standard screening lanes during 
                times when PreCheck screening lanes are closed to 
                individuals enrolled in such program in order to 
                maintain operational efficiency.
            (6) Vetting for precheck participants.--Not later than 90 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Administrator shall initiate an assessment of the security 
        vulnerabilities in the vetting process for the PreCheck program 
        that includes an evaluation of whether subjecting PreCheck 
        participants to recurrent fingerprint-based criminal history 
        records checks, in addition to recurrent checks against the 
        terrorist watchlist, could be done in a cost-effective manner 
        to strengthen the security of the PreCheck program.

SEC. 3212. PRECHECK AND GENERAL PASSENGER BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Administrator shall conduct a pilot project to 
establish a secure, automated, biometric-based system at airports to 
verify the identity of passengers who are members of TSA PreCheck. Such 
system shall--
            (1) reduce the need for security screening personnel to 
        perform travel document verification for individuals enrolled 
        in TSA PreCheck;
            (2) reduce the average wait time of individuals enrolled in 
        TSA PreCheck;
            (3) reduce overall operating expenses of the 
        Administration;
            (4) be integrated with the Administration's watch list and 
        trusted traveler matching program;
            (5) be integrated with other checkpoint technologies to 
        further facilitate risk-based passenger screening at the 
        checkpoint, to the extent practicable and consistent with 
        security standards; and
            (6) consider capabilities and policies of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection's Global Entry Program, as appropriate.
    (b) Establishment of Screening System for Certain Passengers.--
Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (l) as 
        subsections (d) through (m), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(c) Establishment of Screening System for Certain Passengers.--
Not later than December 31, 2017, in accordance with the requirements 
of the Transportation Security Administration Reform and Improvement 
Act of 2015, the Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration shall establish a secure, automated system at all large 
hub airports for verifying travel and identity documents of passengers 
who are not members of the Administration's risk-based aviation 
passenger screening program, known as `TSA PreCheck'. Such system 
shall--
            ``(1) assess the need for security screening personnel to 
        perform travel document verification for such passengers, 
        thereby assessing the overall number of such screening 
        personnel;
            ``(2) assess the average wait time of such passengers;
            ``(3) assess overall operating expenses of the 
        Administration;
            ``(4) be integrated with the Administration's watch list 
        matching program; and
            ``(5) be integrated with other checkpoint technologies to 
        further facilitate risk-based passenger screening at the 
        checkpoint, to the extent practicable and consistent with 
        security standards.''.

SEC. 3213. LIMITATION; PRECHECK OPERATIONS MAINTAINED; ALTERNATE 
              METHODS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the 
Administrator shall direct that access to expedited airport security 
screening at an airport security checkpoint be limited to only the 
following:
            (1) A passenger who voluntarily submits biographic and 
        biometric information for a security risk assessment and whose 
        application for the PreCheck program has been approved, or a 
        passenger who is a participant in another trusted or registered 
        traveler program of the Department.
            (2) A passenger traveling pursuant to section 44903 of 
        title 49, United States Code (as established under the Risk-
        Based Security for Members of the Armed Forces Act (Public Law 
        112-86)), section 44927 of such title (as established under the 
        Helping Heroes Fly Act (Public Law 113-27)), or section 44928 
        of such title (as established under the Honor Flight Act 
        (Public Law 113-221)).
            (3) A passenger who did not voluntarily submit biographic 
        and biometric information for a security risk assessment but is 
        a member of a population designated by the Administrator as 
        known and low-risk and who may be issued a unique, known 
        traveler number by the Administrator determining that such 
        passenger is a member of a category of travelers designated by 
        the Administrator as known and low-risk.
    (b) PreCheck Operations Maintained.--In carrying out subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall ensure that expedited airport security 
screening remains available to passengers at or above the level that 
exists on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Frequent Fliers.--If the Administrator determines that such is 
appropriate, the implementation of subsection (a) may be delayed by up 
to 1 year with respect to the population of passengers who did not 
voluntarily submit biographic and biometric information for security 
risk assessments but who nevertheless receive expedited airport 
security screening because such passengers are designated as frequent 
fliers by air carriers. If the Administrator uses the authority 
provided by this subsection, the Administrator shall notify the 
Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate of 
such phased-in implementation.
    (d) Alternate Methods.--The Administrator may provide access to 
expedited airport security screening to additional passengers pursuant 
to an alternate method upon the submission to the Committee on Homeland 
Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate of an independent assessment 
of the security effectiveness of such alternate method that is 
conducted by an independent entity that determines that such alternate 
method is designed to--
            (1) reliably and effectively identify passengers who likely 
        pose a low risk to the United States aviation system;
            (2) mitigate the likelihood that a passenger who may pose a 
        security threat to the United States aviation system is 
        selected for expedited security screening; and
            (3) address known and evolving security risks to the United 
        States aviation system.
    (e) Information Sharing.--The Administrator shall provide to the 
entity conducting the independent assessment under subsection (d) 
effectiveness testing results that are consistent with established 
evaluation design practices, as identified by the Comptroller General 
of the United States.
    (f) Reporting.--Not later than 3 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Administrator shall 
report to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate on the percentage of all passengers who 
are provided expedited security screening, and of such passengers so 
provided, the percentage who are participants in the PreCheck program 
(who have voluntarily submitted biographic and biometric information 
for security risk assessments), the percentage who are participants in 
another trusted traveler program of the Department, the percentage who 
are participants in the PreCheck program due to the Administrator's 
issuance of known traveler numbers, and for the remaining percentage of 
passengers granted access to expedited security screening in PreCheck 
security lanes, information on the percentages attributable to each 
alternative method utilized by the Administration to direct passengers 
to expedited airport security screening at PreCheck security lanes.
    (g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
to--
            (1) authorize or direct the Administrator to reduce or 
        limit the availability of expedited security screening at an 
        airport; or
            (2) limit the authority of the Administrator to use 
        technologies and systems, including passenger screening canines 
        and explosives trace detection, as a part of security screening 
        operations.

SEC. 3214. SECURE FLIGHT PROGRAM.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator shall--
            (1) develop a process for regularly evaluating the root 
        causes of screening errors at checkpoints across airports so 
        that corrective measures are able to be identified;
            (2) implement such corrective measures to address the root 
        causes of such screening errors occurring at the checkpoint;

Rap Back Service with the period in which the individual who is the 
subject of an inquiry has a valid credential.
    ``(f) Credential Security.--By not later than September 30, 2015, 
the Administrator shall issue guidance to airports mandating that all 
federalized airport badging authorities place an expiration date on 
airport credentials commensurate with the period of time during which 
an individual is lawfully authorized to work in the United States.
