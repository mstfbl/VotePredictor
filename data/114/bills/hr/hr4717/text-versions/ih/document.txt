                                 A BILL


 
    To establish a policy against sexual abuse on all United States 
    military installations, whether located in the United States or 
                               overseas.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Mandating America's Responsibility 
To Limit Abuse, Negligence and Depravity Act'' or the ``MARTLAND Act''.

SEC. 2. ADOPTION OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY AGAINST SEXUAL ABUSE 
              ON ALL UNITED STATES MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Members of the United States Army and Marine Corps 
        serving in Afghanistan were advised to respect cultural and 
        religious practices of Afghans and told that sexual abuse 
        perpetrated by local allies was a matter of Afghan law.
            (2) In one report, a United States soldier said that, from 
        his bunk at a base in southern Afghanistan, he could hear 
        Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought 
        to the base and that ``at night we could hear [the boys] 
        screaming but we're not allowed to do anything about it''.
            (3) Fighting in a foreign theater of war should not require 
        members of the Armed Forces to turn a blind eye toward criminal 
        perversion.
            (4) The Department of Defense already has an established 
        policy against human trafficking.
            (5) Department of Defense Instruction 2200.01 instructs 
        members of the Armed Forces as follows: ``Oppose prostitution, 
        forced labor, and any related activities contributing to the 
        phenomenon of trafficking in persons (TIP). TIP is a violation 
        of U.S. law and internationally recognized human rights, and is 
        incompatible with DoD core values.''.
            (6) The Department of Defense also needs an established 
        policy to counter sexual abuse perpetrated on a United States 
        military installation, whether the installation is located in 
        the United States or overseas.
    (b) Policy Against Sexual Abuse on Military Installations.--It is 
the policy of the United States that human rights violations, including 
child abuse, shall not be conducted or condoned on any United States 
military installation, whether located in the United States or 
overseas, by either citizens or nationals of the United States or 
foreign nationals.
    (c) Implementation of Policy.--No later than 90 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
the congressional defense committees a comprehensive plan detailing the 
procedures by which the Secretary will implement the policy expressed 
in subsection (b).
    (d) Military Installation Defined.--In this section, the term 
``military installation'' includes United States combat outposts and 
forward operating locations.
