                                 A BILL


 
 To provide an additional allocation of low-income housing tax credits 
 in response to the Superfund site related condemnation of low-income 
                          housing in Indiana.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency East 
Chicago Housing Relief Act of 2016''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1972, the West Calumet Housing Complex of East 
        Chicago, Indiana, was established on the site of a former white 
        lead smelting facility.
            (2) On February 7, 1992, the Environmental Protection 
        Agency (hereafter referred to as the ``EPA'') proposed a 79 
        acre tract of land comprising the former lead refinery 
        operation for listing on the National Priorities List.
            (3) On November 18, 1993, the EPA issued an administrative 
        order to manage the former lead refinery site under the 
        Resource Conservation & Recovery Act.
            (4) By June 2004, the EPA had begun managing the former 
        lead refinery site under the Comprehensive Environmental 
        Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as 
        Superfund.
            (5) In 2012, the EPA presented a negotiated decision to 
        remediate the West Calumet Housing Complex and remove the lead 
        contaminated soil. A comprehensive testing process was 
        initiated to detail the extent of the contamination in the 
        area.
            (6) In April 2016, final review of the soil tests revealed 
        higher than expected levels of lead in the land, including two 
        significant lead hot spots, and the EPA began a public 
        messaging campaign to alert West Calumet Housing Complex 
        residents of the health risks.
            (7) Following this public notification, approximately 1,100 
        residents were informed that the West Calumet Housing Complex 
        would close rather than proceed with remediation and that the 
        residents would need to find new homes.
            (8) East Chicago, Indiana, currently lacks the capacity to 
        accommodate the relocation of the West Calumet Housing Complex 
        residents, forcing the residents to look far from their current 
        homes for new housing.

SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL HOUSING CREDIT DOLLAR AMOUNT IN CONNECTION WITH 
              SUPERFUND SITE RELATED CONDEMNATION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
              IN INDIANA.

    (a) In General.--For purposes of section 42 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986, in the case of calendar years 2017 and 2018, the State 
housing credit ceiling of Indiana shall be increased by the lesser of--
            (1) the aggregate housing credit dollar amount allocated 
        for such calendar year by the State housing credit agency of 
        Indiana to buildings located in Lake County, Indiana, or
            (2) the additional allocation amount.
    (b) Additional Allocation Amount.--For purposes of subsection (a), 
the ``additional allocation amount'' means $18 multiplied by the 
population of Lake County, Indiana (as determined on the basis of the 
most recent census estimate of resident population released by the 
Bureau of the Census before July 31, 2016).
    (c) Dollar Limitation To Apply in the Aggregate to 2017 and 2018.--
In the case of calendar year 2018, the additional allocation amount 
taken into account under subsection (a)(2) shall be reduced by the 
amount of the increase in the State housing credit ceiling determined 
under subsection (a) for calendar year 2017.
                                 <all>
