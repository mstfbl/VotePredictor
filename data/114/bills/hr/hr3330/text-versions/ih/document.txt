            (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
        Representatives to consider any bill, joint resolution,

        congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff 
        benefit.
            (2) Procedure.--If a point of order is raised under 
        paragraph (1) with respect to a congressional earmark, limited 
        tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit and the point of order 
        is sustained, the congressional earmark, limited tax benefit, 
        or limited tariff benefit shall be deemed to be stricken from 
        the measure involved.
            (3) Special procedure for conference report and amendments 
        between the houses.--
                    (A) In general.--If a point of order is raised and 
                sustained under paragraph (1) with respect to a 
                conference report or a motion that the House recede 
                from its disagreement to a Senate amendment and concur 
                therein, with or without amendment, then after 
                disposition of all such points of order the conference 
                report or motion, as the case may be, shall be 
                considered as rejected and the matter remaining in 
                disagreement shall be disposed of under subparagraph 
                (B) or (C), as the case may be.
                    (B) Conference reports.--After the House has

                (1) with respect to a conference report--
                            (i) if the conference report accompanied a 
                        House measure amended by the Senate, the 
                        pending question shall be whether the House 
                        shall recede and concur in the Senate amendment 
                        with an amendment consisting of so much of the 
                        conference report as was not rejected; and
                            (ii) if the conference report accompanied a 
                        Senate measure amended by the House, the 
                        pending question shall be whether the House 
                        shall insist further on the House amendment.
                    (C) Motions.--After the House has sustained one or 
                more points of order under paragraph (1) with respect 
                to a motion that the House recede and concur in a 
                Senate amendment, with or without amendment, the

                        request a further conference with the Senate.
                            (iii) A motion that the House insist on its 
                        disagreement to the Senate amendment.
    (b) Determination by House.--If a point of order is raised under
