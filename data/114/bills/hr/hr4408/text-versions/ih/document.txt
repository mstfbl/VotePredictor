 To require the development of a national strategy to combat terrorist 
                    travel, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Strategy to Combat 
Terrorist Travel Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. NATIONAL STRATEGY TO COMBAT TERRORIST TRAVEL.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it should 
be the policy of the United States to--
            (1) continue to regularly assess the evolving terrorist 
        threat to the United States;
            (2) catalogue existing Federal Government efforts to 
        obstruct terrorist and foreign fighter travel into, out of, and 
        within the United States, as well as overseas;
            (3) identify such efforts that may benefit from reform or 
        consolidation, or require elimination;
            (4) identify potential security vulnerabilities in United 
        States defenses against terrorist travel; and
            (5) prioritize resources to address in a risk-based manner 
        any such security vulnerabilities.
    (b) National Strategy and Updates.--
            (1) In general.--In accordance with paragraph (2), the 
        President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional 
        committees a national strategy (including, as appropriate, 
        updates to such strategy) to combat terrorist travel. The 
        strategy shall address efforts to intercept terrorists and 
        foreign fighters and constrain the domestic and international 
        travel of such persons. Consistent with the protection of 
        classified information, the strategy shall be submitted in 
        unclassified form, including, as appropriate, a classified 
        annex.
            (2) Timing.--
                    (A) Initial strategy.--The initial national 
                strategy required under paragraph (1) shall be 
                transmitted not later than 180 days after the date of 
                the enactment of this Act.
                    (B) Updated strategies.--Updated national 
                strategies under paragraph (1) shall be transmitted not 
                later than 180 days after the commencement of a new 
                presidential administration.
            (3) Coordination.--The President shall direct the Secretary 
        of Homeland Security to develop the initial national strategy 
        and updates required under this subsection and shall direct, as 
        appropriate, the heads of other Federal agencies to coordinate 
        with the Secretary in the development of such strategy and 
        updates.

                to constrain domestic and international travel by 
                terrorists and foreign fighters;
                    (B) identify specific security vulnerabilities 
                within the United States and abroad that may be 
                exploited by terrorists and foreign fighters;
                    (C) delineate goals for--
                            (i) closing the security vulnerabilities

                        ability to constrain domestic and international 
                        travel by terrorists and foreign fighters; and
                    (D) describe actions to be taken to achieve the 
                goals delineated in subparagraph (C), as well as the 
                means needed to do so, including--
