                   materials, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Toxics by Rail Accountability and 
Community Knowledge Act of 2015'' or the ``TRACK Act''.

SEC. 2. CHEMICAL EXPOSURE RIGHT-TO-KNOW.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Long-lasting or irreversible health consequences.--The 
        term ``long-lasting or irreversible health consequences'' means 
        those health consequences occurring at the exposure threshold 
        defined in the Acute Exposure Guideline Level AEGL-2 or AEGL-3, 
        as established by the National Advisory Committee for the 
        Development of Acute Exposure Guideline Levels for Hazardous 
        Substances.
            (2) Post-accident public health assessment.--The term 
        ``post-accident public health assessment'' means a scientific 
        assessment of the impacts of a hazardous material release on 
        public health made by a qualified entity.
            (3) Qualified entity.--The term ``qualified entity'' means 
        a Federal, State, or other governmental entity responsible for 
        emergency response, public health, chemical safety or 
        transportation, or environmental protection.
    (b) Right-to-Know Protections.--Beginning 180 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, railroad carriers that are found to be at 
fault by an administrative, judicial, or investigatory process for an 
accident or incident during calendar year 2010 or later that led to an 
unintended release of hazardous materials shall--
            (1) periodically review any post-accident public health 
        assessments regarding the extent to which individuals exposed 
        to the hazardous material that was released could experience 
        long-lasting or irreversible health consequences;
            (2) timely inform individuals exposed to the hazardous 
        material of any health information, including information 
        regarding long-lasting or irreversible health consequences, 
        included in such reports; and
            (3) offer to renegotiate any legal settlements made to 
        individuals impacted by a hazardous material release for which 
        additional information about the potential for long-lasting or 
        irreversible health consequences has been later disclosed in a 
        post-accident public health assessment.
    (c) Enforcement.--Any railroad carrier violating subsection (b)(3), 
or a regulation prescribed pursuant to subsection (b)(3), shall be 
liable to the Federal Government for a civil penalty for each violation 
or for each day the violation continues, as follows:
            (1) A railroad carrier that has annual carrier operating 
        revenues that meet the threshold amount for Class I carriers, 
        as determined by the Surface Transportation Board under section 
        1201.1-1 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, shall be

    (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe 
regulations requiring a railroad carrier transporting a hazardous 
material--
            (1) to provide first responders, emergency response 
        officials, and law enforcement personnel in the communities 
        through which the hazardous material is transported with 
        accurate and current commodity flow data; and
            (2) to assist with the development of emergency operations 
        and response plans designed to protect public health and 
        community safety in the event of a railroad accident or 
        incident involving the hazardous material.
    (b) Considerations.--In prescribing regulations under subsection 
(a), the Secretary may consider which hazardous materials or classes of 
hazardous materials are most relevant to be included within commodity 
flow information based on factors such as--
            (1) the volume of the hazardous material transported; and
            (2) the threat to public health and community safety posed 
        by each hazardous material.

SEC. 4. MOVEABLE BRIDGE INSPECTION BEFORE TRAIN MOVEMENT.

    (a) Procedure Required.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall

regulation prescribed pursuant to this section, shall be liable to the 
Federal Government for a civil penalty for each violation or for each 
day the violation continues, as follows:

led to a fatality or personal injury, an evacuation, or environmental 
damage within the last 5 years.

        of hazardous materials by railroad that threatens public health 
        or safety.
    (b) Emergency Response Standardization.--The Secretary of

        material;
            (2) physical indications of a release of a hazardous 
        material, including a focus on hazardous materials that are 
        most commonly transported in or near a given community;
            (3) methods of communication that will be used to alert the
