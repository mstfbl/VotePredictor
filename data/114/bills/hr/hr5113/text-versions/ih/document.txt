                                 A BILL


 
 To encourage initiatives for financial products and services that are 
 appropriate and accessible for millions of American small businesses 
          that do not have access to the financial mainstream.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in America's Small 
Businesses Act of 2016''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Small businesses in underserved areas have for 
        generations been unable to access affordable credit.
            (2) A 2013 report commissioned by the U.S. Small Business 
        Administration shows the major constraint limiting the growth, 
        expansion, and wealth creation of small firms--especially 
        women- and minority-owned businesses--is inadequate capital.
            (3) Small businesses revitalize communities by creating 
        jobs, and also contribute to the local tax base, which helps 
        finance investments in schools, hospitals, infrastructure, and 
        public safety.
            (4) A 2015 report from the Carsey School of Public Policy 
        at the University of New Hampshire found that 79 percent of 
        CDFI loan volume went to borrowers from underserved 
        populations.
            (5) During the financial crisis, CDFI loan funds expanded 
        their activity to meet increased demand from borrowers that 
        could not access traditional lending. From 2006 to 2009, the 
        median fund deployment ratio grew 3.1 percent annually.
            (6) After Superstorm Sandy, CDFIs launched disaster 
        recovery loan programs and reached out to affected businesses 
        and organizations to provide credit to help grocery stores and 
        social service organizations re-open to help communities in 
        need.
            (7) A 2014 report by the Dardin School of Business at the 
        University of Virginia found that despite serving predominately 
        low-income markets, CDFI banks and credit unions had virtually 
        the same level of performance as mainstream financial 
        institutions.

SEC. 3. GRANTS TO ESTABLISH LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUNDS FOR SMALL BUSINESS 
              LENDING.

    (a) In General.--The Community Development Banking and Financial 
Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.) is amended by adding

            ``(2) to encourage community development financial 
        institutions to establish and maintain small business loan
