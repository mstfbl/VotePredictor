        to alternative fuel operation shall not--
                    ``(A) be considered tampering under this section if 
                the aftermarket conversion system manufacturer or the 
                person performing the conversion is able to demonstrate 
                that the development and engineering sophistication of 
                the conversion technology is--
                            ``(i) matched to an appropriate vehicle or 
                        group of vehicles; and

                        accordance with good engineering judgment so 
                        that the aftermarket conversion system does not 
                        degrade emission performance, as compared to 
                        the performance of the vehicle or vehicles 
                        before the conversion; or
                    ``(B) require the issuance by the Administrator of 
                any certificate of conformity.
            ``(2) Label.--The person performing a conversion described 
        in paragraph (1) shall affix a label to the motor vehicle 
        stating that--
                    ``(A) the vehicle has been equipped with an 
                aftermarket conversion system; and
                    ``(B) the installation of that system occurred 
                after the initial sale of the vehicle.
            ``(3) No preclusion of orders.--Nothing in this subsection 
        may be construed to preclude the Administrator from issuing an 
        order to prohibit the manufacture, sale, distribution, or 
        installation of an aftermarket conversion system if the 
        Administrator has evidence that the installation of the 
        aftermarket conversion system on a vehicle degrades emission 
        performance.''.
    (b) Biomass Fuels.--Section 211 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7545) is amended by adding at the end the following:
