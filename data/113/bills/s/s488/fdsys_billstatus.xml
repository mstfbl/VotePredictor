(2) develop standard testing procedures and technologies for evaluating the performance of advanced heavy vehicle technologies under a range of representative duty cycles and operating conditions; (3) evaluate heavy vehicle performance using work performance-based metrics other than those based on miles per gallon; and (4) undertake a pilot program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial applications of technologies to improve total machine or system efficiency for nonroad mobile equipment and seek opportunities to transfer relevant research findings and technologies between the nonroad and on-highway equipment and vehicle sectors.</p> <p>Authorizes the Secretary to construct heavy duty truck and bus testing facilities.</p> <p> Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to repeal provisions that: (1) establish the joint flexible fuel/hybrid vehicle commercialization initiative; (2) require the Secretary to accelerate efforts for improving batteries and other rechargeable energy storage systems, power electronics, hybrid systems integration, and other technologies for use in hybrid vehicles; (3) establish the domestic manufacturing conversion grant program; and (4) establish a research, development, and demonstration program to determine the feasibility of using hydrogen propulsion in light-weight vehicles and the integration of the associated hydrogen production infrastructure using off-the-shelf components.<BR> <BR> Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to repeal the vehicle energy storage demonstration program.</p>]]></text>
