(2) support efforts by democratically oriented opposition groups to agree upon a political transition plan that protects the rights of Syria's minority groups; (3) help ensure that, once a stable transitional government is established in Syria, it is committed to multiparty democracy, respect for human rights and religious freedom, protection of refugees, promoting peace with its neighbors, and rehabilitating former combatants; and (4) implement fully existing sanctions on Syria.</p> <p>(Sec. 5) States that the purposes of assistance under this Act are to: (1) support democratic, inclusive transition in Syria; (2) assist the people of Syria, especially internally displaced persons and refugees, in meeting basic needs; (3) provide support to neighboring countries hosting Syrian refugees and to international organizations providing humanitarian relief; (4) oppose the unlawful use of violence against civilians by all parties to the conflict in Syria;
