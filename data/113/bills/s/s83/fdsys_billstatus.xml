          <text><![CDATA[<p>Government Shutdown Prevention Act of 2013 - Declares that, if any regular appropriation bill for a fiscal year does not become law before the beginning of the fiscal year, or a joint resolution making continuing appropriations (continuing resolution) is not in effect: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury shall fully pay principal and interest on the federal debt held by the public; and (2) Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits shall be fully paid and new enrollees shall be accepted.</p> <p>Declares also that, if the defense appropriations bill has not been enacted, the Department of Defense (DOD) shall operate at 90% of the level of funding for the preceding fiscal year, except for funding for overseas contingencies in Iraq and Afghanistan, which shall be funded at 100% of the preceding fiscal year levels. Authorizes DOD to pay all military personnel at the full level of pay.<br> </p> <p>Requires federal employees of unfunded agencies to: (1) report for business as normal; and (2) be paid, when funding is provided, at 75% of their salaries for the time worked while under the requirements of this Act. Requires DOD civilian employees based in the United States also to be paid at 75% for the same period.</p> <p>Limits Congress and the Executive Office of the President to operation at 50% of the level of funding for the preceding fiscal year during a period that any agency is not funded.</p> <p>Prohibits Members of Congress and the President from receiving salaries or back pay during the period an agency is not funded.</p> <p>Requires all other non-personnel accounts not funded by a regular appropriations bill or a continuing resolution to operate at 2/3 of the level of the preceding fiscal year. Dedicates the use of savings from this reduction to reduce the federal budget deficit. Prohibits expenditure of any funds during such a period to: (1) carry out the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (2) pay for any abortion, or (3) be provided to any nongovernmental organization that promotes or performs abortion.<br> </p>]]></text>
