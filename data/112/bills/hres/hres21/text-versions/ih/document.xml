	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas nuclear weapons are inherently indiscriminate and
			 represent a disproportionate use of force;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, since the end of the Cold War, the United States
			 has squandered a superb opportunity to diminish the role of nuclear weapons in
			 foreign and military affairs and failed to verifiably eliminate existing stocks
			 of nuclear weapons as well as prevent new nuclear dangers from arising, and
			 consequently the threat of nuclear disaster remains unacceptably high;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas United States foreign policy is eroding the
			 network of security treaties that have helped to stem the spread of nuclear,
			 chemical, and biological weapons, thus decreasing security for Americans and
			 non-Americans alike;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has a vital security interest in
			 promoting the nonproliferation and disarmament of nuclear weapons, since the
			 only genuine and permanent security from the threat of the use of nuclear
			 weapons is their elimination under strict and effective international
			 control;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
			 Weapons (NPT) (21 UST 483) entered into force and became part of United States
			 law on March 5, 1970;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas more countries (a total of 188) have ratified the
			 NPT than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement, a testament to
			 the significance of the NPT;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has undertaken, in accordance
			 with article VI of the NPT, to “pursue negotiations in good faith on effective
			 measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to
			 nuclear disarmament”;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the long-term viability of the nonproliferation
			 goal is at risk if the United States fails to implement its article VI
			 obligations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States agreed, in connection with the
			 indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, to the “determined pursuit” of
			 “systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with
			 the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons”, including a pledge to complete
			 negotiations on a “universal and internationally and effectively verifiable
			 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty no later than 1996”;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on July 8, 1996, the International Court of
			 Justice, in response to a request for an advisory opinion from the United
			 Nations General Assembly, concluded that—</text>
			<paragraph id="HE15F7D0FB2FA4967B7DB016BE41FE650"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">“the threat or use of nuclear weapons would
			 generally be considered contrary to the rules of international law applicable
			 in armed conflict”;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0B4FC7845FCE4538A97AE5EB2D1BF5D9"><enum>(2)</enum><text>“there exists an
			 obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to conclusion negotiations leading
			 to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective
			 international control”; and</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB42FBEBE7C574B95B929E78AD166FA9B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>“[t]he legal
			 import of [the NPT article VI] obligation … is an obligation to achieve a
			 precise result—nuclear disarmament in all its aspects—by adopting a particular
			 course of conduct, namely, the pursuit of negotiations on the matter in good
			 faith”;</text>
			</paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, from April 24 to May 19, 2000, the United States
			 and all NPT parties participating in the 2000 NPT Review Conference unanimously
			 agreed to 13 steps for the systematic implementation of article VI,
			 including—</text>
			<paragraph id="HAD081A9DAEB44E559631990B17324966"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">an unequivocal undertaking to eliminate
			 their nuclear arsenals;</text>

			 implementation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II) (ratified
			 on January 26, 1996) and conclusion of negotiations on the Strategic Arms
			 Reduction Treaty III (START III) as soon as possible, while preserving and
			 strengthening the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (23 UST 3435; entered into
			 force on October 3, 1972);</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H71BFFE5CF2F44AB39719A187D022DF51"><enum>(4)</enum><text>taking concrete
			 measures to reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H095BB520F26D4D81AA882653A4C32B3A"><enum>(5)</enum><text>taking
			 irreversible measures toward total nuclear disarmament;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HC82820CA55C04A6D9A4C9F371CE9C79C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>increasing

			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF1040553FB0841E9B6393658358277EB"><enum>(7)</enum><text>diminishing the
			 role of nuclear weapons in security policies;</text>
			</paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT),
			 signed on May 24, 2002 (ratified on March 6, 2003), by President George W.
			 Bush, fails to incorporate key elements of the START II and START III
			 agreements regarding the destruction of delivery vehicles and the dismantlement
			 of warheads, and it fails to provide new verification procedures necessary to
			 effect transparent, meaningful, and permanent reductions crucial to the
			 de-nuclearization process;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the SORT called for a decrease in the number of
			 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but projected storage of thousands of
			 strategic warheads, including many capable of quick redeployment;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas rather than affirming the United States
			 obligations under the NPT, the January 9, 2002, Department of Defense Nuclear
			 Posture Review (NPR) called for a New Strategic Triad consisting of nuclear and
			 conventional offensive strike systems integrated with active and passive
			 defenses and a revitalized defense infrastructure with new capabilities;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the NPR—</text>
			<paragraph id="H9E451A363B9944A0A45DE439E4849A42"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">projected indefinite retention of a large,

			 expands the role of nuclear weapons in United States national security policy,

			 Treaty;</text>

			 increase readiness to resume nuclear testing and proceed with development of a
			 Ballistic Missile Defense; and</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF399BB221C3140109DCEADFCA3E52741"><enum>(5)</enum><text>called for the
			 development of new nuclear weapons capabilities for a wide range of missions,
			 including nuclear earth-penetrating weapons to strike hardened and deeply
			 buried targets, and low-yield nuclear warheads;</text>
			</paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas rather than affirming the United States
			 obligations under the NPT, the September 2002 National Security Strategy of the
			 United States set forth an aggressive policy of preventive self-defense in
			 which “America will act against … emerging threats before they are fully
			 formed”;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas rather than affirming the United States
			 obligations under the NPT, the December 2002 National Strategy to Combat
			 Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) stated that “The United States … reserves the
			 right to respond with overwhelming force—including through resort to all of our
			 options—to the use of WMD against the United States, our forces abroad, and
			 friends and allies”, with both “conventional and nuclear response”
			 capabilities;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the above-detailed policies and programs of the
			 United States are—</text>
			<paragraph id="H2C33A3D6AB6244DD909D2D0E349075CD"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">antithetical to United States obligations
			 under the NPT;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAEA88255439545A582FF94A2C7B2DB47"><enum>(2)</enum><text>contrary to
			 fundamental requirements of international law, because the United Nations
			 Charter does not permit preventive war;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HEFA08E5F1DA2452A91A826F70D504726"><enum>(3)</enum><text>counterproductive,
			 because United States reliance on nuclear weapons encourages other countries to
			 acquire them, ultimately increasing the likelihood that a nuclear weapon will
			 be used against the United States;</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H44999924F76F41858E248E36844E2DA2"><enum>(4)</enum><text>dangerous, because
			 the assertion of the United States of a right to engage in preventive war
			 encourages other countries to assert the same right; and</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAA2337EA9E1A41468209A9333A02C66B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>immoral, because
			 they place a threat of mass destruction, and the assertion of a right to
			 initiate war, at the core of United States foreign policy;</text>
			</paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas nonproliferation strategies based on
			 internationally accepted standards of behavior, ranging from treaties to
			 enforcement mechanisms such as on-site inspections, technical surveillance,
			 intelligence sharing, and the destruction of all such weapons of mass
			 destruction, are designed to prevent the proliferation and development of all
			 forms of WMD, so that hostile countries and entities either are unable to
			 procure WMD or are required not to use WMD;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas nonproliferation strategies emphasizing
			 reciprocity and cooperation that are consistent with international law have
			 been used successfully for the last 50 years, while counterproliferation
			 strategies based primarily on the unilateral use of force, outside the
			 framework of international organizations and agreements, are likely to lead to
			 the disintegration of existing arms control and nonproliferation mechanisms and
			 a renewed, more complex arms race; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas former United States national security officials
			 Henry Kissinger, Sam Nunn, George Schultz, and Bill Perry called for
			 establishing a goal for the global elimination of nuclear weapons: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
