                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
               Supporting the reunification of Jerusalem.

Whereas for 3,000 years Jerusalem has been the focal point of Jewish religious 
        devotion;
Whereas there has been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for three 
        millennia and a Jewish majority in the city since the 1840s;
Whereas the once thriving Jewish majority of the historic Old City of Jerusalem 
        was driven out by force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War;
Whereas, from 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city, and Israeli citizens 
        of all faiths, as well as Jewish citizens of all states, were denied 
        access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan;
Whereas, in 1967, Jerusalem was reunited by Israel during the conflict known as 
        the Six Day War;
Whereas, since 1967, Jerusalem has been a united city, and persons of all 
        religious faiths have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within 
        the city;
Whereas Jerusalem has been administered as a unified city, in which the rights 
        of all faiths have been respected and protected;
Whereas each sovereign country, under international law and custom, has the 
        right to designate its own capital;
Whereas Jerusalem is the seat of the Government of Israel, including the 
        President, Parliament, and the Supreme Court;
Whereas the United States maintains its embassy in the functioning capital of 
        every country except in the case of Israel, a friend and strategic ally 
        of the United States;
Whereas the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-45), which became law 
        on November 8, 1995, states as a matter of United States policy that 
        Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel; and
Whereas the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 
        107-228) directs that the Secretary of State shall, upon the request of 
        a citizen or a citizen's legal guardian, record the place of birth of a 
        United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem as Israel: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) reaffirms to the residents of Jerusalem and the people 
        of Israel the importance of the reunification of that historic 
        city;
            (2) strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an 
        undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and 
        religious group are protected as they have been by Israel;
            (3) calls upon the President and Secretary of State to 
        repeatedly affirm publicly, as a matter of United States 
        policy, that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the 
        State of Israel;
            (4) strongly urges the President to discontinue the waiver 
        contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-
        45), immediately implement the provisions of that Act, and 
        begin the process of relocating the United States Embassy in 
        Israel to Jerusalem;
            (5) further urges United States officials to refrain from 
        any actions that contradict United States law on this subject; 
        and
            (6) reaffirms Israel's right to take necessary steps to 
        prevent any future division of Jerusalem.
